        "raw_content": "SZ firms display leading tech products at CES\nShenzhen enterprises have unveiled their latest consumer electronic products and innovative technologies at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world\u2019s most powerful tech event, which kicked off Tuesday in Las Vegas, the U.S.\nThe four-day event, themed on \u201cAll together, all on,\u201d features 25 topics, including 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), digital medicine, robotics and drones, smart city, smart home, space technology, vehicle technology, Web3, and the metaverse.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

But we did notice some genuinely exciting things this year, including the one item almost all of us were talking about: a TV that becomes completely see-through.\nHere\u2019s more about that, and a baker\u2019s dozen other things that we\u2019re looking forward to in 2024:\nA TV you look through\nLG Transparent OLED (LG OLED T, LG OLED Signature T), later this year, price TBD\nLG\u2019s wireless, transparent OLED TV is a fantastical concept that few people will buy\u2014but everyone will want.\nUsing proprietary wireless video technology and some kind of pixel magic that LG didn\u2019t fully explain, the 77-inch 4K transparent OLED TV creates images that seem to float in space.\nFish appear to be swimming in midair. Snow appears to materialize in your living room. When turned off, the TV basically disappears.\nIt also has a rolling contrast screen that can slide up behind it to turn it into a traditional OLED TV.\nIt has no bezel, no wires, nowhere to plug anything in, and\u2014somehow\u2014no discernible heat signature (I reached behind the transparent display, and it was surprisingly cool).\nWhile there is a roughly 1-inch-thick screen suspended in the TV\u2019s housing frame, you can see right through to the wall behind it, though the glass still has a slight sepia tone. The transparent display creates a kind of faux 3D effect while you\u2019re watching, such that the images appear to occupy the full space between the wall at the rear and the front of the screen.\nThough AV fans may argue that the effect dispels traditional cinematic immersion, it\u2019s still an undeniably captivating spin on the usual TV-watching experience.\nLG has stated that the LG OLED T will be available to buy later this year, and though we\u2019ll love to see it show up in department stores and hotel lobbies, it\u2019s not likely to be priced for the average buyer\u2014unless you have tens of thousands to spare for a nearly invisible TV.\nA more comfortable heart-rate monitor\nGarmin HRM-Fit, available now, $150\nGarmin unveiled the HRM-Fit, which attempts to eliminate some of the long-standing discomfort associated with wearing a heart-rate monitor.\nIn the demos we saw, the HRM-Fit clipped to a sports bra, negating the need to wear a band across the entire chest, which we\u2019ve noticed sometimes leads to chafing or irritation with other monitors.\nAside from heart rate, the monitor also tracks steps and calories burned, as well as feedback on your running strides (through the Garmin Connect app). Garmin advertises the HRM-Fit as having a one-year battery life.\nA smart gadget for good boys\nPawport, May 2024, from $450\nThe smart home was ubiquitous at CES, with internet-connected models of nearly any device imaginable on display.\nTopping my list of favorites was the Pawport, a smart pet door that opens and closes automatically when your pet approaches.\nWhat is so appealing to me (note, I don\u2019t even have a pet and am still unreasonably thrilled by this thing) is how thoughtfully the software and hardware were designed. The result is the essence of what makes a \u201csmart\u201d device desirable.\nThe Pawport consists of a pair of powered aluminum doors connected by steel hinges to a steel frame. You screw the frame around an existing pet door and then slide the Pawport down over the frame.\nAround the inside of the doors is rubber weatherstripping that compresses when the doors close to form an airtight seal. The doors are either insulated or have rechargeable, slide-in batteries that last several months between charges.\nOn top is a suite of intuitive touch controls, including open, close, lock, and power.\nThe companion to the doors is a collar fob with a rechargeable battery that sends a Bluetooth signal to the Pawport so that it opens when the pet approaches from inside or outside. It\u2019s also smart enough not to open the door if your pup decides to lie down within range of the door.\nThe Pawport is due in May and will be sold in a range of sizes and finishes\u2014that\u2019s plenty of time for me to convince my wife that a dog is the thing our family is really missing.\nSecurity over the longer range\nAbode Edge Camera, later this year, $200\nOutdoor security cameras should help give you peace of mind, but if Wi-Fi connection issues plague your outdoor cameras, you\u2019ll find no peace.\nAbode\u2019s new answer to that problem\u2014the Abode Edge Camera\u2014replaces traditional Wi-Fi with HaLow wireless technology, which gives it a range of almost 1.5 miles.\nIn addition to long range, HaLow is good at penetrating structures, making this camera suitable for outdoor use while the unit\u2019s wireless hub, which connects to your main network, sits safely indoors.\nThe weatherproof camera includes a 6,000 mAh rechargeable battery, which the company says will power the camera for up to a year.\nThe camera can integrate with Abode\u2019s security systems, including the one we reviewed.\nOther security camera companies have tackled the long-distance Wi-Fi problem by skipping it altogether and including 4G LTE connections in their cameras, but those models require an expensive subscription fee through carriers such as T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAbode\u2019s Edge camera is expected to sell for $200 and requires just a $4-per-month service plan for cloud video storage.\nSimple, (almost) instant smoking\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, available now, $1,000\nAt CES I saw more grills, smokers, and meat thermometers than in my local Home Depot, but the standout was the countertop GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker.\nSmoking adds distinct flavor to all kinds of foods, but it\u2019s typically done over lower temperatures for long hours, requiring the cook to camp out in the backyard by a hot black metal bin to feed the fire and actively manage the smoke and the temperature. To do it well, in other words, you need passion, time, and skill.\nIf the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works as billed\u2014the company says you can set it to specific recipes and let it do the work, or you can independently control the heat or smoke level\u2014it can effectively turn smoking into a readily accessible cooking technique for anyone who wants it, just like air frying or sous vide. Imagine popping a few eggplants into a microwave-sized appliance to make killer homemade baba ghanouj on a weeknight, or smoking your own spice blends or chiles whenever the mood strikes.\nI got a sneak peek at this cooker late last year on a research trip to the GE Appliances manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where I got to sample some perfectly prepared wings hot out of the box\u2014tender, smoky, sweet, and moist.\nA few more important details: The smoker uses the same pellets as traditional pellet smokers do. It fits 40 wings, a brisket cut in half, or a whole chicken, and it has the same technology to keep the smoke safely inside the appliance and out of your home as the hearth oven made by Monogram, GE Appliances\u2019s luxury brand.\nA simple pocket drone for action selfies\nHoverAir X1, available now, from $350\nDJI has had a death grip on the hobby drone market for the past few years, and for good reason. The image quality, control systems, and autonomous flight modes on the brand\u2019s drones have excelled in our testing, and DJI\u2019s lineup satisfies almost every budget and need.\nThat\u2019s why I was excited to find a tiny, cheap, and potentially uniquely usable drone made by a different company at this year\u2019s CES.\nThe HoverAir X1 is a 4.4-ounce, foldable drone that aims to enable people to capture quick and easy close-up footage. It lacks a dedicated controller, instead focusing on autonomous flight modes and subject-tracking software to follow activities.\nWe\u2019ll be testing this drone against our picks to see if this $350 model ($400 with two extra batteries) can compete with the much more expensive and versatile DJI Mini Pro series. While we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll replace the more expensive cinematic drones, it may be a useful and relatively affordable tool for folks looking to capture simple follow-along footage.\nWash and dry in one laundry machine\nGE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer, available now, $2,900\nIn the future, will a combo washer/dryer actually dry your clothes?\nCombo washer/dryers were plentiful at CES this year, and we found the GE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer to be the most intriguing.\nTwo-in-one laundry machines aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re generally less popular. These machines are heat-pump dryers, which use a closed-loop heat system (no vents) to dry clothes at a lower temperature. In practice that has made them less effective at drying clothes.\nDeveloping the UltraFast Combo required years of GE research into heat-pump dryers, which has resulted in patented technology meant to boost the drying process. If this new approach substantially improves drying performance, it could be the beginning of a major change for laundry appliances.\nA ventless machine that requires less space and less time to operate could transform how people do laundry. Even better: Heat-pump dryers use substantially less energy than traditional dryers, and these home appliances qualify for home energy rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ll be testing this combo washer/dryer, along with several others, later in the year.\nIn-ear translation and out-of-ear sound\nVasco Translator E1, June 2024, $390\nVasco has put its impressive handheld live translator into an earbud format. The Vasco Translator E1 earpiece translates nearly 50 languages in real time (though it still needs to be connected to an app on your phone).\nAnd if the final product works like the demo, its performance will be impressive.\nVasco spent a lot of time working with linguists to address idioms and variations in meaning that direct word-for-word translations don\u2019t consider, which can be crucial to understanding someone in business settings, at medical appointments, or when you\u2019re speaking with local police. The translated text is visible in the app and spoken through the earpiece.\nMagSafe-like wireless charging for Android phones\nBaseus Qi2 Magpro Magnetic Wireless Charging Car Mount, early 2024, price TBD\nBig advancements in charging technology are rare, but a new development in this sphere was hard to miss at this year\u2019s CES: Qi2 (pronounced \u201cchee two\u201d) wireless charging.\nLike Apple\u2019s MagSafe, Qi2 uses rings of magnets to ensure easy alignment between phone and charger, and it allows any compatible device to charge at up to 15 W\u2014twice as fast as the original Qi spec could deliver. Even better, it isn\u2019t proprietary to Apple, so any device that rolls out with a Qi2 certification going forward (maybe the next Pixel?) will be able to take advantage of its faster charging speeds and sturdy magnetic connection.\nOf all the Qi2 chargers we saw on the showroom floor this week\u2014and there were many, from well-known brands like Anker, ESR, and Hyper\u2014we\u2019re most excited about a wireless-charging car mount from Baseus (set to launch in early 2024). Not only does it support Qi2\u2019s 15 W charging speeds, but it also has a small built-in fan to help your phone stay cool. This is handy since wireless chargers in general are prone to overheating, which can damage your device\u2019s battery over time.\nTurntable music that doesn\u2019t have to stop\nVictrola Automatic Turntable, later this year, $200\nWhile some vinyl enthusiasts want turntables that let them tweak every aspect, others, especially those new to the hobby, want something that doesn\u2019t require so much homework\u2014or money.\nThe Victrola Automatic is the latter kind.\nAs a fully automatic turntable, it lowers the tonearm to begin play and raises it at the end. Just place your record down and hit the play button. Victrola also introduced a repeat mode that automatically moves the stylus back to the beginning of the record and plays it again (and again), a useful feature if you\u2019re spinning a favorite.\nThe Victrola Automatic can connect to wired or wireless speakers and includes RCA outputs with a switchable preamp, plus Bluetooth to stream to a pair of wireless speakers, such as the Edifier S1000MKII, our pick for the best powered speakers with Bluetooth.\nComputer monitors go OLED\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM Monitor, later this year, price TBD\nPC monitors are getting bigger, brighter, and equipped with far more contrast than ever before.\nNearly every PC vendor announced a new 4K OLED monitor at CES, so we expect a lot of competition for our best 4K monitor guide this year.\nMost LCD monitors you\u2019ve seen have a backlight that shines through the TV\u2019s picture, illuminating it to be visible. In OLED technology, each one of the screen\u2019s pixels illuminates itself and can individually turn on or turn off for the most pure black tones.\nFor gamers, this year\u2019s OLED displays are especially eye-catching. The LG UltraGear 32GS95UE, for instance, can switch what\u2019s on the display at 240 Hz, or 240 times per second. That higher refresh rate makes animations and motion on the screen seem more crisp and real. And the 32GS95UE can even boost the refresh rate to a staggering 480 Hz, if it knocks its 4K resolution down to 1080p. For everybody else, OLEDs offer fantastic color accuracy and nearly infinite contrast.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for that LG monitor, as well as Asus\u2019s ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which supports the DolbyVision HDR format.\nAI comes to your laptop\nVarious laptops from many brands, later this year, prices vary\nMicrosoft has dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of the AI PC.\u201d\nThe addition of the flashy new Copilot shortcut key allows even quicker access to your PC\u2019s AI capabilities. It also marks the first major change to the Windows keyboard in nearly three decades.\nBut the more significant change is under the hood. This year\u2019s newest PCs with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors have NPUs, or neural processing units, that run machine-learning processes locally. As a result, these tasks can run faster, can use less battery life, and can be more secure than sending them off to the cloud.\nSome notable examples of laptops with these processors include new versions of our top ultrabook picks that are available now\u2014the HP Spectre x360 14, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405), and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12\u2014as well as a fleet of other premium laptops shipping in the coming months.\nRight now, AI PC features are limited\u2014the prime example is Windows Studio effects, which use AI for video-conferencing features such as background blur and noise cancellation. But now that NPUs are available in a big way from Intel and AMD, many laptop and software companies are building apps and features that take advantage of them.\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to use a conversational interface for navigating and changing settings on your PC without having to dig through labyrinthine menus, or ask for a summary of a meeting transcript. We expect to see these AI PC features evolve over the coming years.\nPC gaming handhelds are here to stay, and Intel is getting involved\nMSI Claw A1M, later this year, price TBD\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since Valve and AMD brought handheld PC gaming to the masses with the Linux-based Steam Deck, and 2023 saw Asus and Lenovo join in with the Windows-based ROG Ally Extreme and Legion Go, respectively.\nBut MSI\u2019s new partnership with Intel for its upcoming Claw gaming handheld\u2014announced at CES and featuring a Meteor Lake\u2013based system-on-a-chip\u2014is the clearest indication yet that the major players in PC gaming are taking these devices more seriously than ever.\nMSI\u2019s Claw borrows heavily from the ROG Ally Extreme. It has a similar form, down to the programmable buttons on the back of each side grip and the function buttons on either side of its 1080p, variable-refresh-rate display. But the differences are obvious as well.\nThe rear of the Claw features a heavily vented design that MSI claims will help with heat dissipation, and MSI has stressed that the included 53 Wh battery should give two hours of battery life on its maximum performance settings, beating out the ROG Ally Extreme and even Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go.\nMSI will still have its work cut out for it against bigger players, and we have good reason to wonder how Intel\u2019s new hardware will fare compared with AMD\u2019s more mature graphics tech. We don\u2019t know how much effective battery life the Claw will have in real-world scenarios, or how easily it will manage different power profiles.\nAt CES, MSI was using October\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage to demonstrate the Claw\u2019s capabilities, but it wasn\u2019t running especially well, and the system-management software was sluggish and poorly organized.\nThe Claw is likely a couple of months away still, and every one of these mainstream gaming handhelds has launched in rough shape\u2014it was months before the ROG Ally Extreme felt stable, the Legion Go is still a work in progress, and the recent Steam Deck OLED model has seen dozens of beta updates since its November launch. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Claw comes together in February or March.\nRegardless, Intel\u2019s entry into the market is a clear indication that it thinks the demand for this kind of device is only going to grow, and after spending time with all of them, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nFaceTime calls made easy\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, later this year, $180\nBelkin\u2019s newest device is a motorized, auto-tracking iPhone dock that enables your phone camera to follow your face\u2014not only around the frame, but 360 degrees around. What this means: FaceTime calls and video recordings can follow you totally hands-free.\nBecause the dock uses Apple\u2019s DockKit API, you don\u2019t have to install an app to set it up. Pairing the dock with your iPhone takes seconds\u2014and the tracking is really good.\nOnce you place your iPhone on the dock\u2019s base, the Stand Pro instantly connects to it via NFC (near-field communication, the same technology that lets you make contactless mobile payments), and it uses Bluetooth to maintain its connection.\nYou can\u00a0activate or deactivate the tracking with the push of a single button, and the stand comes equipped with a screw port in case you want to attach it to a tripod, too. The Stand Pro also charges your iPhone via 15 W MagSafe charging, and the dock itself offers five-hour battery life when unplugged. We were impressed by the demo and can\u2019t wait to test the dock once it\u2019s available.\nThis article was edited by Jason Chen and Ben Frumin.\nMeet your guide\nWirecutter Staff\nFurther reading\nThe Best of CES 2022: What We\u2019re Most Looking Forward To\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter\u2019s expert staff found a few things to look forward to from CES 2022, including a smarter faucet and a projector that doubles as a portable speaker.\nThe Best Electric Vehicle Chargers for Home\nby Sarah Witman\nAfter 28 hours of research and 85 hours of testing, we found the best ways to charge your J1772 (non-Tesla) or Tesla electric vehicle at home.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking Forward To From CES 2019\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter reporters and editors spent three days working overtime at CES 2019 to find the new stuff that might actually improve your life this year.\nThe Best of CES 2023: What We\u2019re Looking Forward to Most\nby Wirecutter Staff\nA smarter water faucet, an excellent wireless speaker, and a cleaning genie were among our favorite things from CES 2023.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI.

This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

It will also allow you to easily connect multiple wireless speakers to each other with diving into an app. Perhaps most importantly, the barrier to entry is going to be very low since a dedicated Auracast app will be built into mobile platforms like iOS and Android. What's more, you'll select available channels like you would a Bluetooth device or a Wi-Fi network. It's simple, and it's presented in a way that people who've used a smartphone are familiar with. Auracast has been mentioned constantly by companies announcing their new audio gear at CES 2024, so here's what you need to know about it.\nRead the full story here.\nTouring LG\u2019s high-tech camping trailer at CES 2024\nLG\u2019s Labs department often takes technology and existing products and spins them into lifestyle-heavy ideas and notions. LG Labs was responsible for the Dukebox, a vacuum tube-driven speaker with a transparent OLED screen, an LG Gram with two displays, and several other projects. But the LG Bon Voyage concept trailer is a little more involved, packing so many of LG\u2019s CES \u201cgreatest hits,\u201d retooled and restyled for near-future camping that\u2019s both incredibly comfortable and\u2026 unlikely.\nThe trailer is 2 meters by 3.8 meters, measuring up to a height of 2.2 meters. LG\u2019s explanation suggests you\u2019d be able to pick and choose which appliances and features are included.\nRead the full story here.\nJackery's rooftop solar tent makes overlanding more environmentally friendly\nThe Jackery Solar Generator for Rooftop Tent is equipped with 1,000W solar panels (with a 25 percent efficiency rate). Unlike the flimsy panels you can currently buy, these are rigid slide-out units that should offer a sturdier canopy under which to sleep. Once you\u2019ve parked up and opened the tent, the panels are wired up to an Explorer 1,000 Plus generator. That\u2019ll hold 1,264Wh of power and can output at rates up to 2,000W, enough to power a 900W cooker for an hour. Plus, you can daisy-chain other batteries alongside to increase the storage further for longer trips away from an outlet and/or civilization.\nRead the full story here.\nCurrent Backyard's electric smart grills bring outdoor cooking to more places\nGas, charcoal and pellet grills are great for taking your cooking outdoors, but a lot of people live in apartments and other spots where open flames aren't permitted. At CES 2024, Current Backyard debuted two all-electric grills that can be used in those places since the heating element for both isn't much different than an oven or stove. And because grilling has entered the modern age, both of these are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected, so you can monitor progress and adjust temperatures from your favorite comfy chair.\nRead the full story here.\nThis moss terrarium doubles as an air purifier and humidifier\nYears ago, some genius decided to build Las Vegas in the middle of a desert, so for me, any sight of unique humidifying tech at CES is a much welcomed sight. It just so happened that a Korean company showcased a device dubbed Moss Air which, as the name implies, uses real moss to purify air. It's also built with a humidifying feature that can shoot outwards or rehydrate the plant internally. In short, you're getting an air-purifying humidifier that doubles as a mesmerizing miniature foggy terrarium on your desktop.\nRead the full story here.\nThe best of CES 2024\nThanks for tuning in to our awards! You can find all of the winners right here. In the meantime, there's more news and impressions to catch you up on. Let's get back to it!\nBest in show: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nCES 2024 is often described as a TV show or car show, but sometimes it\u2019s more niche products that capture our imagination. GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker is a countertop device that makes proper barbecue in your kitchen without filling your home with smoke. It\u2019s designed to move air around the food to impart maximum smokiness inside, without letting airflow out. When your brisket, chicken or whatever is done, a filtration and catalyst system draws the smoke down, eventually expelling it as warm air.\nTypically smoking food requires constant adjustments and vigilance, but the Smart Indoor Smoker has six preset cooking modes, while you\u2019re able to adjust the degree of smokiness between five different levels. The wood pellets\u2019 only function is to add flavor and not fuel the actual cooking process, so only a handful are needed per smoke session.\nGE included a smart probe with the Smart Indoor Smoker too, so you can monitor the cooking process from a companion app and its Smoke and Hold feature can cook and smoke foods and keep them at food-safe temperatures for up to 24 hours. It\u2019s not small (it's around the size of a mini fridge), but it\u2019s stylish and simple to use, with a low barrier to entry for anyone tempted to try smoking their own foods. The device was also able to impart an impressive level of smokiness in only a few hours \u2014 we can\u2019t wait to see what low-and-slow smoking could do.\nEcoFlow Delta Ultra\nA whole-home battery and inverter system is far from the funkiest bit of hardware we saw at CES, but it\u2019s likely one of the more useful. The EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra can take in and store power from your rooftop solar panels then use the stored energy to power your home. The DELTA Pro Ultra can even suck up juice from the grid when it's cheaper, and feed it back when energy prices surge.\nA base configuration goes for $5,800 and includes one 6kWh battery and inverter, but you can stack up to five batteries per inverter and chain up to three inverter-and-battery stacks, amounting to a 90kWh capacity. That\u2019s a beastly amount of power that could keep a McMansion humming at full tilt for a few days \u2014 or run essential appliances in a more moderately sized home for a month or longer.\nThe DELTA Pro Ultra can also hook into an existing transfer switch if you have one, but for deeper integration with your home\u2019s power system, the subpanel-like Smart Home Panel 2 gives you features like app control, weather and power grid monitoring, and instant switchover to backup when the power goes out. As more solar panels are installed on rooftops, a sleek and powerful all-in-one battery solution like this can give people more control over how their power is used. If you\u2019re intrigued, you don\u2019t have to wait \u2014 it\u2019s one of many CES 2024 gadgets already on the market.\nMicron LPCAMM2 laptop RAM modules\nIf you've ever been annoyed that you couldn't upgrade your RAM in an ultraportable laptop, Micron has a potential solution: LPCAMM2 memory. It's a new form factor that's 64 percent smaller than standard SODIMM RAM sticks, and it's also potentially far faster and more efficient. Best of all is that it's a self-contained unit that can easily be removed and upgraded down the line.\nLPCAMM2 RAM won't get as much hype as AI PCs, but it's something that could transform what's possible with future laptop designs. And if it means laptop makers stop soldering RAM directly onto motherboards, we'll call it a win.\nSamsung Ballie\nCES was a little light on notable robots this year, but Samsung revived one we loved when we first saw it way back in 2020. Ballie is an adorable, bowling ball-sized robot that rolls around your home, following you around like a robotic pet that's eager to please. Ballie is a lot bigger than it was when we saw it in 2020, and it now has a built-in 1080p projector so it can both show you things and speak to you when you ask it for help. Think of it like a Nest Hub on wheels.\nWe only got to see Ballie in a tightly-plotted demo at Samsung's booth, but it was simply delightful to watch Ballie roll around projecting workout routines, calendar updates and recipe videos on the walls. As with most smart home gadgets, there's a little bit of \"solution searching for a problem\" here. But it feels like Samsung nailed the form factor judging by how smoothly Ballie navigated its way around the demo area. And while many companies show off products like this that have no chance of actually reaching people in the real world, Samsung says Ballie will go on sale this year.\nKia Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBV)\nKia\u2019s PBV, or Platform Beyond Vehicles, concept is the rare car concept (or concepts, plural) that seems like it might actually be a real thing in the relatively near future. The PV5 is likely to be the first to make the leap. It\u2019s a small modular van that can be equipped with a taller roof for extra headroom, or turned into a pickup by swapping out the back two-thirds. It can also be turned into a taxi with extra seating for passengers.\nOne of the more interesting things is how the members of the PBV family, including the larger PV7 and the smaller PV1 are expected to work together. For instance, Kia imagines a rail system that can connect a PV7 directly to a PV1, transferring cargo to the smaller vehicle for last mile deliveries.\nMost importantly, PBV isn\u2019t some fantastical dream vehicle that will never be heard from again: Kia is already building a dedicated factory in Korea that\u2019s expected to be ready to pump out 150,000 vehicles in 2025.\nGyrogear GyroGlove\nThe number of accessibility and aging-related products that were good enough for us to consider for awards at CES 2024 was encouragingly high. We saw a tongue-operated touchpad, a hearing aid-like system that can isolate individual speakers in a noisy crowd and a visual radar for gamers with hearing loss. But GyroGlove stood out for a few reasons.\nThe device uses a sophisticated gyroscope to help those with hand tremors (say, Parkinson's patients) stabilize their movement, but one of the deciding factors in picking it as a winner is the fact that it's actually available. The company said it's already in talks with the chief medical officers of several insurance providers in the US, and has registered the GyroGlove as a medical device with the FDA and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. It's certified by various international standards organizations, to boot.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser's Momentum True Wireless series has consistently earned the accolade of the best-sounding earbuds in our best of list for a while now. However, the company never really had the complete package to knock Sony's 1000X series off the top spot. At CES this year, Sennheiser debuted the fourth-gen version of its flagship earbuds, which bring a host of upgrades. They still sound excellent, ANC and transparency mode are also improved.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 did a great job blocking out the noisy Las Vegas suite, allowing us to focus on the selection of jazz we used to demo the earbuds. Transparency mode also sounded more natural, which will be a big help for calls and tuning into your surroundings. What's more, Sennheiser figured out a way for active noise cancellation to not drain the battery nearly as much as it typically does; the ANC here only cuts listening time by half an hour.\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nWhen it comes to smoking meat at home, your options are usually limited to outdoor grills that burn charcoal, pellets or wood. If you live at a place where your landlord doesn't allow open flames, like apartments, then you're pretty much out of luck. The GE Profile Smoker ditches the flames for electric heating elements and brings low-and-slow smoking indoors.\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is no gimmick either. It\u2019s capable of infusing significant smoke flavor via wood pellets as we experienced first hand this week. There won't be any smoke wafting around your kitchen as the unit captures all of that with its filtration system. If you need to cook while you're away, a unique feature does that and then holds your food at a safe temperature until you're ready to serve. Toss in Wi-Fi for remote cooking and monitoring, cooking profiles and guidance, plus the Clear Smoke tool for when you need to open the door, and the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker has a lot to offer a range of skill levels.\nWithings BeamO\nThere\u2019s never a shortage of health and fitness tech at CES. This year Withings stood out with its $250 BeamO \u201cmultiscope.\u201d It combines a body temperature sensor, an electrocardiogram, an oximeter and a digital stethoscope into one surprisingly light consumer device that promises to make it easier to collect basic health metrics at home. The company's Health Mate app collects all of that data, which can then be sent to doctors with a few taps. Withings is also seeking FDA approvals for the BeamO to be able to detect atrial fibrillation.\nBeamO impressed us not only with its versatility and fairly affordable price, but also for the potential impact it could have on telemedicine. Providing your doctor with key metrics ahead of a call or visit could make it easier for them to give you sound medical advice. And those with chronic conditions could use BeamO to keep track of health data over the long term.\nASUS ZenBook Duo\nASUS has been chasing the dream of dual-screen notebooks for a while, but this year's ZenBook Duo appears to be its best attempt yet. It consists of two separate components: a dual-screen display unit and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. You can use the ZenBook Duo in a typical clamshell mode, with the keyboard in front of one of its displays. But when you have more room, you can open up the display to have two screens sitting on top of each other (balanced on a built-in kickstand).\nThe ZenBook Duo also feels incredibly polished, and it has high-end hardware like Intel's Core Ultra chips and gorgeous OLED screens. It also starts at a reasonable $1,500, making it a dual-screen laptop for the masses.\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro\nWith its third-generation NXTPAPER display, TCL\u2019s latest 14-inch tablet combines the best things about LCD displays and e-readers. You get a sharp 2.8K-resolution panel with bright colors plus a special nano-coating that not only reduces glare, but also cuts down excess blue light while providing a lovely matte texture. And for those who prefer a more traditional newspaper-like reading experience, there\u2019s a monochrome mode that makes the NXTPAPER 14 Pro look like it has an e-ink screen. So while its specs aren\u2019t all that impressive (MediaTek Dimensity 8020, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage), TCL\u2019s new tablet is one of those rare gadgets that appeals to both hardcore tech nerds and traditionalists that still remember a time before everything went digital.\nLG Signature OLED T\nOLED TVs are great. An OLED TV you can see through \u2014 well, that\u2019s just wild. The LG Signature OLED T isn\u2019t the first transparent display we\u2019ve seen at CES, but it is the first that will actually be sold to consumers (unlike Samsung\u2019s similar transparent MicroLED concept).\nThis is a 77-inch set with an retractable contrast screen. Keep the filter up, and it looks like one of LGs standard, excellent OLED sets. Bring it down, and the image almost looks like it\u2019s floating in mid-air. Like Samsung\u2019s Frame TVs, the Signature OLED T is designed for ambience \u2014 when you\u2019re not watching a show or movie, it can display little animations (a digital fish tank, for instance). To help it feel less obtrusive, the TV also uses LG\u2019s wireless Zero Connect tech, which relegates most of the set\u2019s I/O (and thus cables) to a separate box that can be tucked away elsewhere.\nThe TV does lack the microlens array tech found in LG\u2019s absolute best OLED TVs and LG isn\u2019t sure if it will come with the furniture you see in the image above. The company says it will ship sometime in 2024, though there\u2019s no firm release date yet. But whenever it does arrive, it will almost certainly be prohibitively expensive for most people.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's line of Frame TVs, first introduced back in 2017, do a great job of disguising a large-screen TV as a piece of art. The Samsung Music Frame does the same thing, but for wireless speakers. Instead of a screen, there's a place to display art or album covers that you swap pretty easily.\nThis wouldn't be noteworthy if the Music Frame didn't sound good \u2014 but in our demo, it did. The Music Frame includes two woofers, two tweeters and two mid-range drivers and supports Dolby Atmos. It's also quite the flexible speaker, working on its own, in a stereo pair or connected to a TV as part of a bigger home theater setup. It's even wall-mountable. We have no price or release date, but given Samsung's success with the Frame TVs, we imagine they won't wait long to get the Music Frame on the market.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

At CES 2024, we can expect to see everything from TVs to laptops, from smartphones to smart tractors. Basically if it runs off of electricity, it'll be at the show.\nCES 2024 technically starts tomorrow, but there have already been a ton of announcements, and the week is just getting started. We're live on the show floor, though, and we'll continue to update this article each day with the latest CES 2024 announcements.. Not everything will actually come to market, but we will get a pretty good idea what products will look like over the next year or so.\nCES 2024: When Is It Happening?\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST). However, unlike many other trade shows which are all about the main keynote, CES is a more prolonged beast. Tech manufacturers from all over the world will have their own keynotes, or will just have gadgets on the show floor to show off.\nThis is why it's a good idea to stay tuned to IGN, as we'll be keeping our eyes open for the strange new technology that is scattered around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nWhat is CES?\nCES stands for the Consumer Electronics Show, an annual industry-only tradeshow that features all the newest technology coming to market over the next couple of years. The show isn't really meant to show new products per se, but rather the tech and trends that are going to be powering the new products.\nEverything Announced at CES 2024 So Far\nNvidia Launches Super-Powered Graphics Cards\nNvidia has announced three new graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super, replacing the RTX 4080, 4070 Ti and 4070, respectively. This is a classic mid-generation refresh looking to convince more folks to upgrade their PCs. The first of these cards to hit the market will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, which comes out on January 17, but don't worry, all three will be out by the end of the month.\nMSI Is Here to Claw Some of the Handheld Gaming PC Market From Asus and Valve\nThe best handheld gaming PCs are here to stay, and the latest is the MSI Claw. Rather than being powered by the AMD Z1 chip, like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally, the Claw is powered by the new Intel Core Ultra processor, backed by Intel Arc graphics. Onboard graphics are usually a bad word when it comes to PC gaming, but this time around both Intel and MSI seem confident in what this chip can do. I know I'm excited to put it through its paces, and see how it compares to the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally.\nApple Swoops In With a Surprise Vision Pro Announcement\nWhile Apple technically isn't here in Las Vegas for CES, the Cupertino giant did take some of the spotlight when it suddenly announced a release date for the Apple Vision Pro, the company's take on a VR/AR headset. Preorders for the headset go live January 19th, and it will officially hit the market on February 2. That's not much longer to wait for a product that we thought was going to keep getting pushed back. Let's just hope it's worth that $3,499 price tag.\nSony and Honda Drive Cars With a DualSense Controller\nSony and Honda teamed up at CES to show off the Honda Afeela driven with a Sony DualSense controller. That's exciting for sure, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just a tech demo and not something that is guaranteed to come to market. And, honestly, it's probably safe to assume it will, at least any time soon. Doesn't stop it from looking cool as hell, though.\nWhat To Expect From CES 2024\nTL;DR: Here's What to Expect\nIt's hard to even think about CES 2024 without bringing up AI. Not only have AI-based language models like Chat GPT been the center of conversation all year, but both Intel and AMD have announced new processors that'll have silicon dedicated to AI workloads. Couple that with the fact Apple has had a Neural Engine built into its processors since the M1 hit the market in 2020 means that LLMs (language learning models) and AI-based image generation are going to be processed locally on the best laptops, rather than in the cloud.\nDon't worry, gaming is totally going to be affected by this too. Ever since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in 2019, Nvidia's graphics cards have shipped with Tensor Cores which are purpose-built to handle machine learning workloads. This is the hardware behind the hugely-successful DLSS, or Deep-Learning Super Sampling. So, you can expect Nvidia to show up in Vegas to show off what's coming next for their own special AI upscaling secret sauce.\n2023 has also been huge for handheld gaming. The Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have all made waves for basically being a Nintendo Switch that can run all your favorite Steam games on the go. However, all of these systems are basically using the same AMD Z1 chipset. It'd be nice to see AMD come out with a new chipset that can show off the next generation of handheld gaming. Or, even better, if Nvidia or Intel came out with something similar that can introduce some competition to that space.\nBeyond gaming, we're likely to hear something from smartwatch manufacturers, especially after Apple announced it would stop selling its flagship smartwatches, according to a report from 9to5Mac. This comes via a lawsuit around Apple using imported blood oxygen level-monitoring technology. So, either we're going to see a new company take on this challenge or we're going to at least hear some kind of discussion about how best to move forward.\nCES 2024 is going to be full of surprises too. Every year the LVCC show floor is packed with inventive little gadgets that really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as we'll keep it updated with the coolest tech CES 2024 has to offer.\nIGNRecommends"

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week.

The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks.
