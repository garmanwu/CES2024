        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Main navigation\nOHKF Innovation and Technology Research Report\nInitiates to Unleash Hong Kong\u2019s Potential as an\nInternational Research and Development Powerhouse\nOHKF Innovation and Technology Research Report\nInitiates to Unleash Hong Kong\u2019s Potential as an\nInternational Research and Development Powerhouse\nOur Hong Kong Foundation (OHKF) has launched a new research report today, titled \u201cUnleash the Potential in Science and Technology Innovation: Develop Hong Kong into an International R&D Powerhouse\u201d. The report puts forward the recommendation for the establishment of interdisciplinary and cross-institutional mega research institutes to drive the development of Hong Kong\u2019s overall science and technology innovation ecosystem. Besides, the report recommends a series of actionable measures to make science and technology innovation a critical growth engine for Hong Kong\u2019s economy through addressing the needs of three fundamental areas: funding, talent, and collaboration.\nEstablishing Interdisciplinary and Cross-institutional Mega Research Institutes\nThe OHKF believes that research and development (R&D) is the foundation underlying science and technology innovation. To fully drive research forward, Hong Kong may take reference from successful examples such as the Broad Institute in the United States to set up mega interdisciplinary and cross-institutional research institutes. These institutes would attract top international scientists to engage in large-scale collaborations to make breakthroughs on the frontier of basic research. In addition, such institutes may provide local researchers with a promising career path, which would also inspire and motivate Hong Kong\u2019s students who are interested in studying STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and embarking on a career in R&D. As a result, the entire science and technology innovation ecosystem in Hong Kong will be given an invigorating stimulus to grow and prosper.\nWith a view to enhance Hong Kong\u2019s science and technology innovation ecosystem to create the optimal conditions for mega research institutes to flourish, the Foundation has made a series of recommendations in this report, which aim to provide higher-level strategies, build the R&D talent pipeline, and promote tripartite cooperation among academia, R&D centres, and industries.\n1. Providing Higher-level Strategies and Enhancing R&D Funding Flexibility\nThe report points out that the current R&D funding sources in Hong Kong are fragmented, which cause inconsistencies and redundancies, and also lead to the absence of an overarching strategy to guide funding allocation. The report recommends the HKSAR Government\u2019s Steering Committee on Innovation and Technology to take reference from Singapore\u2019s National Research Foundation and the UK Research and Innovation to establish an overarching Research and Development Foundation (RDF). The RDF will provide higher-level strategies and advise prioritised areas to guide R&D funding allocations.\nIn addition, the report indicates that the Government\u2019s R&D funding mechanism lacks flexibility. For example, the average processing time taken by the Innovation and Technology Commission to approve projects for its five R&D centres could take between 158 to 222 days, which limits the research efficiency of R&D centres. The report advocates to increase the funding autonomy and flexibility for R&D centres with reference to other public institutions in Hong Kong, such as the University Grant Committee\u2019s research funding mechanism for universities.\n2. Building the R&D Talent Pipeline and Providing a Promising R&D Career Path\nThe number of R&D talents in Hong Kong is relatively small, with only 3,400 researchers per million population, which is only about half of Singapore\u2019s ratio. One of the key reasons is that the ratio of research postgraduate students (RPg) to professors in Hong Kong is only 2.4: 1, far lower than that of 4.1: 1 in the United Kingdom. The report recommends the Government to gradually increase the number of research postgraduate students in order to raise the ratio of RPg students-to-professors. At the same time, the Government should expand the scope of eligible areas of admission under the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (TechTAS) by including technology-related professional areas such as intellectual property protection and technology management, in order to facilitate the conversion of Hong Kong\u2019s R&D outputs into marketable products.\nBesides, the combination of a scarcity of research graduates and a lack of scientific research positions in Hong Kong is forming a vicious cycle. Establishing mega research institutes, as recommended in the report, will help break this cycle by providing more internationally competitive jobs and building a promising career path for scientific researchers, thereby retaining locally-grown talents and incentivising local students to study STEM subjects at universities.\n3. Fostering Cross-institutional Collaboration to Release Potentials from Upstream to Downstream Research\nIn Hong Kong, there has always been insufficient interdisciplinary and cross-institutional collaborative research. Only 48% of all research funding from the Research Grants Council are allocated to collaborative projects in Hong Kong, which is far lower when compared to 75% in the UK Research and Innovation\u2019s Research Councils. One of the main reasons for this is that the assessment criteria at the individual and institutional levels are biased towards individual research, which hinder the formation of a collaborative research culture. The report recommends revising individual and institutional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to incentivise collaborative research. For example, the contribution of co-authors should be given greater recognition, while collaborations between universities and other institutions should also be fairly reflected in the evaluation system. The mega research institutes, as proposed in the report, is another critical R&D infrastructure that can encourage in-depth, interdisciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration in leading scientific fields.\nBesides, existing collaborations among universities, R&D centres, and industries in Hong Kong still require improvement. The report suggests that the R&D centres could emulate the model of Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Society. At the industries\u2019 end, it should take advantage of the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area to strengthen collaboration between R&D centres and industries at the high-end of the value chain. At the universities\u2019 end, R&D centres should strengthen their ties with local universities to improve the quality of their scientific research and deepen the tripartite collaborative relationship between the industries, R&D centres, and universities.\nMr Stephen Wong, Deputy Executive Director and Head of the Public Policy Institute of OHKF, said: \u201cThe establishment of mega research institutes is of great importance to the development of science and technology innovation in Hong Kong, for they not only provide promising career prospects to local graduates that aspire to conduct research, but also offer the sector an abundance of resources, shared scientific research facilities, and an environment conducive to collaboration. This will attract the world\u2019s top scientists to come to Hong Kong, where they can make breakthroughs in the most cutting-edge research areas.\u201d\nMr Kenny Shui, Assistant Research Director of OHKF, further commented: \u201cHong Kong is one of the most competitive economies in the world, but it needs to catch up in terms of its innovation capability. Fortunately, Hong Kong possesses competitive edges in science and technology innovation through our basic research, which secures us an early advantage. With further improvement in the local conditions for science and technology innovation, Hong Kong definitely stands a strong chance of developing into an international R&D powerhouse.\u201d\n\u76f8\u95dc\u6587\u7ae0\n\u300c1+\u300d\u6a5f\u5236\u958b\u555f\u9999\u6e2f\u91ab\u85e5\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\n\u653f\u7b56\u601d\u8003/\u57f9\u990a\u672a\u4f86\u4eba\u624d \u8ffd\u4e0a\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\n\u6e2f\u7248\u85e5\u76e3\u5c40\u7c4c\u5099 \u62db\u5546\u5f15\u8cc7\u589e\u7af6\u722d\u529b\nOur Hong Kong Foundation Launches Policy Research Report\n\u201cDevelop Hong Kong into Asia\u2019s Leading Clinical Innovation Hub\u201d\nCopyright Notice\uff5cPrivacy Policy Statement\uff5c Disclaimer\n\u00a9 2024 Our Hong Kong Foundation Limited.

The multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is set to feature swaths of the latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more \u2014 with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will be keeping a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the most interesting developments in vehicle tech, to wearables designed to improve accessibility to the newest smart home gadgets.\n___\nPLAYSTATION CONTROLLER MAKES A CAMEO APPEARANCE AT SONY ANNOUNCEMENT\nIzumi Kawanishi, president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc., holds up a PlayStation controller before using it to drive an Afeela EV onto the stage during a Sony press conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\nSony Honda Mobility returned to the CES this year with some updates to its Afeela EV. While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won\u2019t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nJose Munoz, president and global CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, speaks during a Hyundai news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nHyundai on Monday spotlighted its future plans for utilizing hydrogen energy. Beyond hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, the South Korean automaker pointed to the possibilities of moving further into move further into energy production, storage and transportation -- as Hyundai works towards contributing to \u201cthe establishment of a hydrogen society.\u201d Company leaders say this sets them apart from other automakers.\n\u201cWe are introducing a way to turn organic waste and even plastic into clean hydrogen. This is unique,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, president and global Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor Company, said in a Monday press conference at CES 2024.\nHyundai also shared plans to further define vehicles based off of their software offerings and new AI technology. With so-called \u201csoftware defined vehicles,\u201d that could include opportunities for consumers to pay for features on demand -- such as advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving -- down the road. Hyundai also aims to integrate its own large language model into its navigation system.\n\u2014\u2014\nSAMSUNG AND HYUNDAI TEAM UP TO ADD AI TO YOUR CAR\nJH Han, CEO and Head of the Device Experience Division at Samsung Electronics, speaks during a Samsung press conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\nSamsung has announced that they are collaborating with Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services to all Kia and Hyundai vehicles.\nWhat that means is that people will be able to use Samsung\u2019s SmartThings service to set your car\u2019s cabin temperature or open its windows, and when you\u2019re in your car, you\u2019ll be able to control your home\u2019s lights and interact with any of your connected smart devices.\nSamsung also announced a team-up with Microsoft to bring more Copilot AI functions to their flagship Galaxy smartphones.\n___\nA \u2018PAWFECT\u2019 COMPANION FOR YOUR PET?\nThe ORo robot dog companion by is displayed during CES Unveiled before the start of the CES tech show Sunday, Jan. 7, 2024, in Las Vegas.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "Main navigation\nOur Hong Kong Foundation Launches Science and Technology Innovation Research Report\nBuilding the Technology Bridge for Scientific Breakthroughs:\nDeveloping an Innovation Hub of the Future\nOur Hong Kong Foundation (OHKF) releases its latest research report on Science and Technology Innovation entitled Building the Technology Bridge for Scientific Breakthroughs: Developing an Innovation Hub of the Future. The Report indicates that although universities in Hong Kong have achieved outstanding achievements in basic research, technology transfer is our weak link, making it difficult for universities to effectively transform the \u2018treasures\u2019 of scientific research findings into products and services that generate significant social and economic impacts. The Report recommends the strengthening of local institutions\u2019 technology transfer capabilities, so as to create a vibrant innovation and technology ecosystem, and to develop Hong Kong into an international innovation hub.\nThe Report points out that local universities accounted for over half of Hong Kong's annual total expenditure in R&D. The proportion is much higher than the respective ratios of around one-fifth and one-tenth in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), which demonstrates the important role that universities play in Hong Kong's innovation ecosystem. In the science and technology innovation report Unleash the Potential in Science and Technology Innovation: Develop Hong Kong into an International R&D Powerhouse that the OHKF published last year, we have put forward recommendations on strengthening the research capabilities of universities and R&D centres. Cutting-edge technology must be commercialised into tangible products or services in order to benefit society, and the key to this is technology transfer. Companies such as SenseTime, Xcelom, and DJI, which are spin-offs from universities in Hong Kong, have all commercialised institutional scientific breakthroughs into disruptive products that bring transformative impacts to the world.\nNevertheless, the performances of local universities in technology transfer are not satisfactory. For instance in 2019, the combined intellectual property (IP) income for all Hong Kong universities totalled HKD 100 million, which was less than one-seventh of that generated by the University of Oxford; the total number of spin-off companies associated with local universities in Hong Kong was only about half of that of the University of Oxford. The OHKF believes technology transfer is the key to unlocking our universities\u2019 R&D \u2018treasures\u2019. If we can effectively unleash the commercial potentials of local universities' research findings, not only would we rejuvenate the local innovation ecosystem but also generate immense benefits for Hong Kong\u2019s economic and social development. On this note, we put forward seven policy recommendations as follows:\nRecommendation 1:\u00a0 Foster a culture conducive to knowledge transfer in universities by enhancing the assessment framework and funding allocation linkage\nIn terms of technology transfer indicators, the data currently collected and published by the University Grants Committee (UGC) and local universities is less than the data disclosed by their overseas peers. Furthermore, the performances of universities regarding these indicators are not tied to the amount of government funding for technology transfer, leading to the difficulties in accessing universities\u2019 performance in technology transfer, and also reducing their motivation to promote technology transfer.\nThe OHKF recommends that the UGC should take reference to the UK's Higher Education Statistics Agency and the Knowledge Exchange Framework, by setting up a more comprehensive database, establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess universities\u2019 technology transfer performance, and allocating funding for technology transfer to universities based on their performance, so as to further encourage a culture conducive to technology transfer among institutions.\nRecommendation 2: Enhance IP mobilisation by offering more flexibilities and options for researchers to commercialise their research\nThe culture of technology transfer is constrained by conservative university policies, such as the ownership, usage, and transfer of patents and the associated revenue-sharing. For example, with regard to the policy on patent ownership in Hong Kong, unless the inventor pays a high price to buy out the patent, the ownership of the patent will remain with the university. However, overseas universities are relatively more generous, with some allowing the inventor to obtain the patent ownership directly, and some allowing the spin-off company to exchange a small share of equity for the patent license. In terms of outside practices, out of the 52 weeks in a year, university staff are currently unable to spend more than one day per week (including weekends, public holidays, and annual leave) for outside work.\nThe OHKF suggests that local universities should relax the regulations on IP rights and outside practices, hence offering universities\u2019 staff greater flexibility and motivation to commercialise their research outcomes.\nRecommendation 3: Improve university research commercialisation through Technology Transfer Offices and a Technology Transfer Alliance\nThe OHKF proposes that universities should invite more professionals, such as business leaders and investors, to join their technology transfer committees to provide diverse professional advice. Also, universities should recruit experts from industries and academia into their technology transfer offices (TTOs). At the same time, we also recommend the TTOs of local universities band together to form a technology transfer alliance (TTA). The TTA should complement the work of TTOs and establish a university-industry network, thus pooling resources to promote the commercialisation of universities\u2019 R&D achievements.\nRecommendation 4: Strengthen the Technology Start-up Support Scheme for Universities\nEntrepreneurship is another option for commercialising basic research. The OHKF recommends that the HKSAR Government (the Government) should improve the Technology Start-up Support Scheme for Universities (TSSSU): In addition to providing condition-free grant for verifying technical feasibility and developing product prototypes in the first phase, a second phase can be added to provide additional government funding for start-ups which succeeded in securing funding from the private market. Tax incentives should also be offered to encourage private investment for these start-ups. At the same time, the TSSSU should foster collaborations with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) and Cyberport, and integrate with private incubators and accelerators, so as to enable start-ups to enjoy full access to its resources and networks.\nRecommendation 5: Utilise the Future Fund to provide patient capital and deep-technology investment strategy to nurture local spin-offs\nContinuous R&D of frontier technologies requires long-term financial support. Hong Kong's edge in R&D lies in \u2018deep tech\u2019 such as biotechnology, which requires substantial funding and lengthy R&D processes (so-called patient capital), but it can bring about profound and long-lasting contributions. Earlier, the Government announced that it would use a portion of the Future Fund to set up an investment portfolio called the \u2018Hong Kong Growth Portfolio\u2019. The OHKF agrees with this initiative, and believes that if the \u2018Hong Kong Growth Portfolio\u2019 can take reference from IP Group and provide patient capital to deep tech spin-offs of local universities, it will amplify the impacts of institutional R&D outcomes, open up new industry opportunities, and further enhance the long-term productivity of Hong Kong's economy.\nRecommendation 6: Establish a high-level Science and Development Office to advise the Chief Executive and the Cabinet, provide strategic directions for overall public R&D funding, and identify use cases to be piloted by public bodies\nThe Government has not established any independent body to provide scientific advice, thus it is unable to keep abreast of the latest global trends in innovation and industry development, resulting in a lack of forward-looking blueprint and vision. Drawing on the practices of the US and Singapore, the OHKF recommends the Government set up a Science and Development Office (SDO) headed by a Chief Science and Development Officer and joined by academics and scientists. The SDO will advise the Chief Executive and the Cabinet, formulate strategic directions for overall public R&D funding, and promote the pilot use of local R&D outcomes in the public sector.\nRecommendation 7: Develop the Kowloon Bay Action Area into a world-class innovation district\nThe technology transfer of innovation achievements cannot be realised without support from the business sector and industry communities. HKSTP, Cyberport, and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop are major science and technology innovation infrastructures, but they are all located far away from the two central business districts. Kowloon East is conveniently located in the proximity of universities, R&D centres, as well as the Data Technology Hub and the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in the Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. It is also an important location for the Government to pilot new technologies such as smart city. Therefore, the OHKF believes that Hong Kong should build a world-class innovation district in Kowloon East. The undeveloped area of \u200b\u200bthe Kowloon Bay Action Area is relatively sizable in Kowloon East. By taking reference from overseas experience, the OHKF proposes that the Government should earmark one-third to one-half of the Kowloon Bay Action Area for the development of a world-class innovation district, which can provide space for the expansion of HKSTP and Cyberport, and attract AI and fintech firms.\nProfessor Dennis Lo, Associate Dean (Research) of Faculty of Medicine, CUHK, remarked, \u2018Relaxing the restriction on outside practices shall offer greater flexibility for researchers to engage in technology transfer activities. This can effectively encourage more research talents to participate in technology transfer and research commercialisation, and to fully capitalise on Hong Kong's R&D edge.\u2019\nProfessor Kam Fai Wong, Associate Dean (External Affairs) of Faculty of Engineering, CUHK, commented, \u2018By improving the assessment framework and KPIs of universities\u2019 technology transfer activities, we can strengthen the importance attached to technology transfer by institutions, promote healthy competition among universities, and co-build a vibrant technology transfer atmosphere.\u2019\nDr Frank Tong, Managing Partner of QBN Capital, highlighted that, \u2018Long-term funding support can play a decisive role in the successful development of disruptive deep tech. If we can follow the model of the UK's IP Group, we will be able to propel the commercialisation of deep tech R&D, thereby creating substantial economic and social impacts.\u2019\nKenny Shui, Assistant Research Director and Head of Economic Development Research of OHKF, pointed out that, \u2018The Government has strengthened investment in the development of technology and innovation in recent years, but the focus largely remained at the stage of basic research. If we can bridge the gap in technology transfer between applied research and the market, and commercialise Hong Kong's exceptional research achievements, we will be able to generate a new way out for Hong Kong's economic and industrial development.\u2019\nFull report of Building the Technology Bridge for Scientific Breakthroughs: Developing an Innovation Hub of the Future:\nChinese version:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3lc1y8z\nEnglish version: https://bit.ly/2U6YA9l\nVirtual press conference:\u00a0https://youtu.be/QarDF0tiT_s?t=250\n\u76f8\u95dc\u6587\u7ae0\n\u300c1+\u300d\u6a5f\u5236\u958b\u555f\u9999\u6e2f\u91ab\u85e5\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\n\u653f\u7b56\u601d\u8003/\u57f9\u990a\u672a\u4f86\u4eba\u624d \u8ffd\u4e0a\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\n\u6e2f\u7248\u85e5\u76e3\u5c40\u7c4c\u5099 \u62db\u5546\u5f15\u8cc7\u589e\u7af6\u722d\u529b\nOur Hong Kong Foundation Launches Policy Research Report\n\u201cDevelop Hong Kong into Asia\u2019s Leading Clinical Innovation Hub\u201d\nCopyright Notice\uff5cPrivacy Policy Statement\uff5c Disclaimer\n\u00a9 2024 Our Hong Kong Foundation Limited.

        "raw_content": "Contents\nHong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute\nThe Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Company Limited (ASTRI) was established by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in 2000 as an R&D centre for information and communications technologies.[1] The Institute states its objective as 'enhancing Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness in technology-based industries through applied research'.[2]\nASTRI focuses on applied research by pursuing R&D projects in partnership with public sector bodies or private sector businesses. Over the years, it has built a portfolio of intellectual properties while developing applications for various industries and sectors. Since 2000, ASTRI has completed over 500 research projects and been granted around 900 patents in the US, Mainland China and other territories.[3] It has transferred over 750 technologies to industries.\nASTRI focuses on five areas of applications: smart city, financial technologies, intelligent manufacturing, digital health, and Application Specific Integrated Circuits through ASTRI's role as the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese National Engineering Research Centre (CNERC).[4]\nOver 600 people currently work for ASTRI based in its facility in Hong Kong Science Park.[5]\nBoard of directors[edit]\nASTRI is headed by the Chief Executive Officer and is governed by a board of directors from the business and academic worlds of Hong Kong and Hong Kong SAR government representatives. The Board of Directors has established three functional committees, namely the Finance and Administration Committee, the Science and Technology Committee and the Audit Committee to assist the Board of Directors in governing the Academy.[6]\nThe current Chairman of the board is Ir Sunny Lee Wai-kwong, JP. The Permanent Secretary for Innovation and Technology and the Commissioner for Innovation and Technology represent the Hong Kong Government in the Board.\nSenior executives[edit]\nKey research areas[edit]\nASTRI's core R&D competence in various areas is organized under five Technology Divisions, namely Artificial Intelligence & Big Data; Communications; Cybersecurity, Cryptography & Trusted Technologies; Integrated Circuits & Systems; and Internet of Things & Sensors.[8]\nJoint initiatives[edit]\nASTRI has established multiple joint R&D laboratories to collaborate with other businesses and institutions. Its major joint initiatives include:\nHong Kong branch of the Chinese National Engineering Research Centre (CNERC) for Application Specific Integrated Circuits\nASTRI Cyber Range in partnership with Hong Kong Police Force[9]\nASTRI Cybersecurity Lab in partnership with Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Hong Kong Institute of Bankers[10]\nASTRI-Hong Kong International Airport Smart Airport Joint R&D Center[11]\nHKMA-ASTRI FinTech Innovation Hub[12]\nBank of China (Hong Kong) - ASTRI Joint Innovation Center for Finance and Technology[13]\nHSBC - ASTRI Joint Innovation Lab[14]\nICBC - ASTRI Joint Innovation Lab[15]\nFunctions[edit]\nThe Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute is currently Hong Kong\u2019s Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) R&D Centre, under which it operates in four technology areas, namely Consumer Electronics, Communications Technologies, IC Design and Optoelectronics.[16]\nIt collaborates with local universities to nurture young talents and entrepreneurs in the I&T and fintech industry,[17] providing Hong Kong and the whole region with greater momentum to become an international I&T hub and strengthening Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center.[18] ASTRI has expanded its I&T footprint in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) as well, by providing incentives (such as scholarships) for local, Mainland Chinese and overseas STEM talents, collaborating with universities and research institutes in the GBA, and encouraging technology transfer via Government-Industry-University-Research cooperation.[19]\nOn a broader level, ASTRI aims at becoming a world-class technology developer and bolstering Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness through applied research and innovation. Its core values are innovation, accountability, respect, service and tenacity. More tangibly, its technology transfers have generated over HK$450 million for commercial industry and it has filed more than 1286 patents, with 900 having been granted. These services are supported by the 500 R&D professionals who work at ASTRI, with 26% holding doctorates and more than 53% holding Master\u2019s degrees.[20]\nProgress in key research areas[edit]\nUnder ASTRI\u2019s four technology divisions are 5 core areas of applied scientific and technological research, namely, smart city, financial technologies, intelligent manufacturing, digital health, application specific integrated circuits and metaverse.[21]\nThey have joint laboratories and research facilities with local and Mainland Chinese educational institutions, private companies and public agencies.[22]\nSmart city\nASTRI has collaborated with both public and private bodies to achieve its goals in developing Hong Kong into a smart city. In 2016, it set up a joint research center with the Airport Authority to accelerate the use of wireless communications and artificial intelligence in Hong Kong International Airport.[23]\nIn 2018, ASTRI announced the launch of the ASTRI-Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) Smart City Joint Laboratory, which aims at developing technologies that facilitate deployment of artificial intelligence, 5G networks, blockchain and big data analytics to address urban challenges and improve public services.\nIt has made progress in areas such as smart mobility by utilizing 5G applications to boost the autonomous vehicle experience and the development of intelligent transport systems in Hong Kong.[24] In addition, ASTRI\u2019s research in areas such as machine learning techniques, cryptography and cybersecurity has also helped streamline currency and payment systems and health record management.[25] In 2019, ASTRI\u2019s Intelligent Sensing Technology System team made breakthroughs in the fields of optoelectronics and sensing technologies by developing tools for automated inspection, spatial light modulators, optical beam steering modules, etc.[26] Its smart city initiative also complements Hong Kong\u2019s environmental and social sustainability through the development of energy conservation systems and integrated intelligent intervention learning systems for SEN students.[27]\nFinancial technologies\nIn terms of financial technology research, ASTRI launched the Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in 2016, which led to the establishment of a cyber resilience framework and cyber intelligence sharing platform.[28]\nIn 2017, it launched the HSBC-ASTRI Research and Development Innovation Laboratory with HSBC, an initiative that has conducted research on block-chain based property valuation, trade finance, Chinese handwriting optical character recognition and digital-ID prototype.[29]\nSimilarly, it has developed a property purchasing platform using blockchain technology by collaborating with New World Development Company Limited, with Bank of China Hong Kong being the first corporate participant.[30]\nMoreover, it has developed a smart investment platform with t.Axiom which provides investors with analyzed empirical market data based on users\u2019 behavioral attributes.[31] On its own, it has designed a credit-scoring framework for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Hong Kong to access funds by providing banks with their business information and documentation.[32]\nASTRI aims at collaborating with its counterparts in the GBA as well to further its research efforts in financial technology.[33]\nIntelligent manufacturing\nIn 2015, ASTRI partnered with Truly Opto-Electrics Ltd for the commercialization of LCD screen research.[34] In 2016, they won the \u201cHong Kong Awards for Industries\u201d in the equipment and machinery design category for their \u201cCover Glass and Touch Panel Glass Automatic Defects Inspection System\u201d, an intelligent inspection system that provides machine vision solutions for applications or devices that use cover glass and touch panel glass.[35]\nASTRI\u2019s research in other areas of intelligent manufacturing, such as in wireless power transfer techniques and advanced power electronics technologies, are aimed towards the broad goals of re-industrialization in the Greater Bay Area.[36]\nDigital health\nASTRI has made progress in the field of biomedical imaging, with its non-invasive health screening devices being used in hospitals and medical centres in Hong Kong.[37] In 2022, it won the silver award in the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva for its preventive eye retina checking solution for seniors- a home AI-enabled scanning system that traces users\u2019 retina movements to detect preventable diseases.[38]\nApplication Specific Integration Circuits\nASTRI focuses on microelectronics and integrated circuits research, and is leading research efforts in third-generation semiconductors.[39]\nOngoing research projects include hardware accelerated 3D conversion systems, narrowband internet of things, Bluetooth low energy solutions and visually enhanced ultra high definition technology.[40]\nHistory[edit]\nBuilding upon the vision espoused by the 1997 Policy Address to establish Hong Kong as an \u201cinnovative centre in the region\u201d and to develop a knowledge-based economy, the inception of ASTRI was proposed in 1998 by the Chief Executive\u2019s Commission on Innovation and Technology headed by Prof. Chang-Lin Tien in their attempt to introduce a detailed blueprint for the city\u2019s long-term innovation and technology development in the immediate post-handover period, of which ASTRI was to play a leading role. The aim was to remedy the gap in midstream R&D capability inhibiting industry from \u201cturning innovative ideas or scientific research results into commercial products\u201d \u2013 a gap identified to be too wide to be narrowed by solely strengthening the capabilities of universities and industries.\nIn their First Report, the Commission proposed ASTRI to perform four key functions, namely (i) conduct midstream R&D on generic and pre-competitive technologies, (ii) house university graduates aspiring to obtain industrial research training, (iii) become a focal point for attracting overseas R&D talent, and (iv) supply technological and human resource capabilities as complements to Hong Kong Science Park. In relation to budgeting and costs, the Commission recommended three sources of funding: recurrent provision from the government, the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) also recommended in the Report, and \u201cincome from contract research and technology transfer to industry\u201d.[41]\nIn their Second and Final Report, the Commission established ASTRI\u2019s role in an overarching institutional framework to coordinate the city\u2019s I&T development involving five broad types of services. ASTRI is to be responsible for (a) R&D support, (b) building up of human capital and (c) technology diffusion and productivity enhancement, with the aid of organizations including but not limited to universities,\nHong Kong Productivity Council, Hong Kong Science Park and the other companies it later merged with to form the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation. The remainder of such services, namely (d) physical infrastructure, and\n(e) incubation of technology-based start-up firms, were delegated to other actors such as Cyberport and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.[42]\nThe proposal was accepted by the Government, with a Task Force chaired by the Director-General of Industry to flesh out the specifics.[43] Subsequently, in 2001, ASTRI was established as a limited company and subvented organization under the Memoranda of Administrative Arrangements and the ITF, with permanent facilities in Science Park. ASTRI\u2019s original missions in the First Report were further expanded to include acting as (v)\na \u201cspawning ground\u201d for innovation and technology entrepreneurs, and (vi) a focal point for collaboration between industries and universities.[44] Six research projects were developed and commenced by 2003, encompassing photonics technologies, wireless communications, integrated circuit design, Internet software and biotechnology.[45]\nMajor developments[edit]\nNarrowing Foci and Expanding Outreach: Two Milestones Recognized by the Government\nIn 2006, ASTRI was designated by the Innovation and Technology Commission as the R&D Centre for Information and Communications Technologies, a division of labour in select focus areas assigned by the Commission in light of the contemporaneous and spontaneous establishments of the Automotive Platforms and Applications Systems R&D Centre, the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre, Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, and the HKRITA.[46] Simply put, ASTRI was no longer the only publicly funded R&D Centre. ASTRI\u2019s foci were to be on companies that commercialize the technologies developed by research institutions, and the process of paid transfer of technology from the research institution to its industry customers for commercialization.[47]\nIn 2012, ASTRI began to be involved in the national efforts for innovation and technology development. ASTRI was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology to establish the first Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese National Engineering Research Centre (\u201cCNERC\u201d) for Application Specific Integrated Circuit System. This was a project in collaboration with\nSoutheast University.[48]\n2007 Audit Commission Review\nProblems with ASTRI\u2019s management surfaced in 2007. The Public Accounts Committee identified several major issues, summarized as follows. Firstly, the profitability of projects commissioned was questionable. Secondly, administrative costs had been abnormally high. Some funds had been misappropriated \u2013 entertainment expenses exceeded the amount stipulated in the annual budget, with a major incident involving the hiring of Chinese geomancy masters thrice instigating much negative publicity .[citation needed] Thirdly, staff recruitment procedures were identified to be improper, of which some staff received salaries higher than the maximum of designated pay bands. In addition, issues arose with project management. Risk analyses were not conducted, and there existed rampant incompliance with regards to reporting requirements. Finally, ASTRI\u2019s Directors failed to observe standard protocol such as attending meetings and signing non-disclosure agreements, and were unwilling to disclose timely and accurate information on its use of funds despite being requested by the Audit Commission.\nThe above issues also signaled the incapability of two government appointed Directors to the Board, namely Permanent Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology and the Commissioner of Innovation and Technology, to monitor ASTRI\u2019s governance.[49] Following the report, the CEO of ASTRI resigned after much reluctance. The absence of further government documents addressing the issue made concluding whether or not ASTRI enforced the changes proposed by the Audit Commission, such as ensuring Directors\u2019 completion of interest forms and reconfiguring pay structures to the market rate,[50] infeasible despite verbal affirmation by the Chief Executive.[51] Scandals involving the misappropriation of funds continued to surface after the review , with some involving its top Directors.[52] However, ASTRI has consistently remained as the R&D Centre with the highest profitability rates in its projects compared with its other publicly funded counterparts.[53]\nOrganizational structure[edit]\nASTRI is governed by a Board of Directors from the academic, industrial and commercial sectors and the Hong Kong SAR Government. The Board comprises 20 directors including the Chairman, 17 members and 2 official members representing the Government. The current Board Chairman is Ir Sunny Lee Wai-kwong, JP. The current Official Members are Ms Annie Choi Suk-han, JP, the Permanent Secretary for Innovation and Technology and Ms Rebecca Pun Ting-ting, JP, the Commissioner for Innovation and Technology.[54]\nThe Board is responsible for designating the policy and strategic directions of ASTRI in carrying out its main functions, which includes decisions related to internal administration, asset management and external relations.[55]\nThere are three functional committees under the Board, namely the Finance and Administration Committee,[56] the Technology Committee [57] and the Audit Committee [58] to assist the Board in overseeing ASTRI\u2019s research initiatives, finance and administration matters, and the internal and external audit processes respectively.\nASTRI\u2019s overall management is headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is responsible to the Board. He is assisted by the Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer to supervise technology divisions, commercial, marketing, financial, administrative, and other functions.\nASTRI\u2019s core research & development competence is organized under four Technology Divisions, namely Trust and AI Technologies, Communications Technologies, IoT Sensing and AI Technologies, and Integrated Circuits and Systems. It is applied across six core areas which are Smart City, Financial Technologies, Intelligent Manufacturing, Digital Health, Application Specific Integrated Circuits and Metaverse.[59]\nAs of 31 March 2021, ASTRI has 626 staff.[53]\nFunding, financing and pay scales[edit]\nThe formal funding source of ASTRI is the Hong Kong SAR government.[60]\nThe Finance and Administration Committee, established by the Board of Directors of ASTRI, formally oversees ASTRI\u2019s finance and administration matters. Comprising members from both academia and the industry, the Committee recommends the Annual Budget to the Board for consideration and adoption, monitors the financial performance of ASTRI, and ensures that funds made available to it are properly expended and accounted for - among other tasks.[61]\nInformation about pay scale is not publicly available, but some anonymous self-reports of salary are found on glassdoor.\nIn 2022, the government continued to invest heavily in I&T, including setting up a HK$5 billion \u201cStrategic Tech Fund\u201d. Its measures included increasing funding for Hong Kong Branches of Chinese National Engineering Research Centres and State Key Laboratories.[62]\nIn addition to regular funding by the government, ASTRI also received income from industry annually. It received $107.4 million and $103.5 million in 2019 and 2020 respectively, with its industry income expected to increase to $113 million in 2021.[63]\nRelations with HKSTP and Cyberport[edit]\nASTRI has actively collaborated with HKSTP alongside external parties\u2019 involvement in the advancement of particular technologies. Examples include the strategic agreement with Infineon Technologies to advance thermal management solutions,[64] the strategic agreement with China Mobile Hong Kong to support Hong Kong\u2019s smart city development [65] and the Blockchain-focused accelerator programme with Mhub Blockchain Limited for start-ups .[66]\nASTRI\u2019s expansion to the Greater Bay Area will be headquartered in HKSTP's forthcoming Shenzhen branch in Futian District,[67] focusing on application specific integrated circuits and 5G technology .[68]\nASTRI, HKSTP and Cyberport have also engaged each other to help develop Hong Kong\u2019s innovation and technological community. They launched and participated in joint initiatives such as the \u201cBlockchain Strategies for Business\u201d Conference [69] and the FinTech Career Accelerator Scheme by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.[69] In 2022, ASTRI established the FinTech Future Leader Academy and offers internships for undergraduates and postgraduates in the relevant disciplines, which includes field visits to HKSTP and Cyberport as supporting organizations.[70]\nInternship aside, joint programs in I&T talent development leveraging the respective foci of I&T quangos appear to be limited. There is little evidence of collaboration between ASTRI, HKSTP InnoAcademy [71] and Cyberport Academy\n[72] in this regard, of which the relevant departments within the three quangos aforementioned appear to host mutually exclusive programs in cultivating and training I&T talent.\nPublic comments were made that ASTRI, HKSTP and Cyberport should be merged and listed for financing purposes .[73]\nEvaluations and public reception[edit]\nNotwithstanding contributions to technological development in Hong Kong, ASTRI has been subject to criticism on several fronts. Earlier problems included financial mismanagement, overpay of staff, and unfairness of recruitment, as an Audit Commission report laid bare in 2006.\nAnother common perception is the stalemate in its early development. After Donald Tsang rose to the position of CE, he did not thoroughly follow up earlier development with new policies and initiatives.[74]\nThe ASTRI is now known for its poorly developed KPIs. Mr. Holden Chow, a legislator of the DAB, commented in 2021 that \u201cthe KPIs of the four R&D centers under ASTRI are actually disappointing in monetary terms\u201d. With evidence from figures during 2015 to 2019, he opined that \u201c$1 billion to $2 billion for operation and R&D work, but the revenues from the commercialized products were less than $50 million\u201d. He called for more effective KPIs to be set for ASTRI in the future.[75] Another legislator Ann Chiang even went further and commented, after a decade-long investment of 10 billion, that \u201cnone can be seen\u201d in the impacts of science and technology research on GDP and economic growth. She noted the absence of producers, and of further development of products after the initial stage of invention .[76]\nMr. So Kam-leung, then Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, likewise admitted earlier in 2011 that the overall cost-effectiveness of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Institute of Chinese Medicine (HKJCICM), a limited company of ASTRI, was not satisfactory either, and its R&D had failed to keep abreast of the latest developments in the Chinese medicine. Some stakeholders had also been discouraged from submitting R&D proposals to the HKJCICM because of different views over some funding conditions imposed by the HKJCICM.[77]\nPublic perception corroborated these observations. Experts in the field, for instance, opine that ASTRI has failed to give full play to its functions and achieve the effect of revitalization of industries, and that a staunch collaboration between ASTRI, the industries and universities remains wanting.[78] Dr. Law Cheung-kwok also pointed to the lack of improvement of its cost-benefit balance over the years. Per an expenditure of HKD$100, he discovered direct commercial revenue of $5. Without a reappraisal of the current performance indicators, accordingly, he expected ASTRI to provide little help to boost the city\u2019s technological development.[79]\nReferences[edit]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nAI Guided is one of 20 Hong Kong-based companies exhibiting with the city's start-up pavilion this year, a big improvement over the eight that exhibited last year because of the last-minute lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.\nEven leading up to the show, Hong Kong Science and Technology Park (HKSTP) said 40 companies applied to exhibit in the Eureka Park start-up area, a marked improvement over previous years, according to H L Yiu, corporate development officer for HKSTP, which runs the pavilion.\n\"We had to make some selection of companies that have more of a mature level of readiness in terms of being ready to sell,\" Yiu said in an interview. \"We really mean to help them get new business.\"\nWith limited space, HKSTP focused on picking companies that were closer to having products ready to go, or even already in the market, with the goal of picking up business deals at CES.\nFor some, that could pan out in a big way.\nInvisible & Innovation Technology, aka Invisible Tech, which builds speakers into furniture, said it has received interest from Best Buy. A representative from the largest electronics retail chain in the US told Invisible Tech that it had not seen other products like its cabinet with an embedded speaker in the base, according to the start-up's co-founder Patrick Lee.\nInvisible & Innovation Technology makes cabinets with embedded speakers, which are partially made of recycled materials.

Henry Cheung, the company's other co-founder, said the company wants to \"help Hong Kong fulfil its carbon neutral mission\". The city aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nThe Hong Kong pavilion at this year's CES, which concluded on Friday, featured a variety of start-ups that make products ranging from the quirky to the practical.\nXOXO Beverages already has its cocktail-making machine in about 10 bars and restaurants in Hong Kong, but it has not expanded to home use yet. Co-founder Peter Yau said CES was the best show the company has been to.\n\"People from all around the world come by and are very interested in the product,\" Yau said. \"[We got] a lot of contacts, and we're looking to see what we can do after [the show] with those guys.\"\nTwo of the participating companies, Sitan Semiconductor International and Raysolve Technology, make micro-LED displays, something that has become more important amid rising interest in augmented reality glasses.\nSitan was started at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the company said its tech has already found its way into products from big brands like TCL, Huawei Technologies, Oppo and Meizu - although not all of these products have been released.\nXOXO Beverages has made a machine that will automatically mix cocktails to specifications inputted through an app. SCMP / Matt Haldane alt=XOXO Beverages has made a machine that will automatically mix cocktails to specifications inputted through an app. SCMP / Matt Haldane>\nFor most of the start-ups, though, CES was about getting leads and looking for ways to expand beyond their home market. Getting the attention of a tech giant like Microsoft is one way to achieve that.\nAsked about the prospects of Microsoft investing, AI Guided's Kong said, \"I hope so ... I will still have another discussion with them, so we'll see.\"\nThis kind of attention also may help the Hong Kong government justify its efforts to turn the city into a tech hub, which has had mixed results in a city better known as a regional financial hub.\n\"From a tech area standpoint, I think the opportunity to come to Hong Kong is surging,\" said HKSTP's Yiu. \"The number of start-ups that we nurture every year is an increasing trend.\"\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
