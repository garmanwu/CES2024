        "raw_content": "BlueAnt debuts desktop soundbar at CES 2024\nAudio equipment provider BlueAnt has unveiled its monitor soundbar Soundblade at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, US.\nBlueAnt said it developed the Soundblade to bridge the gap between monitor speakers and the visual experience, \u201callowing users to truly feel the content they are watching and listening to.\u201d\nThe Soundblade claims to deliver \u201caudio and deep bass, crystal-clear dialogue, rich music, dynamic sound effects\u201d to provide auditory experience for its form factor.\n\"With the launch of the Soundblade, we're not just pushing the boundaries in desktop audio technology; we're redefining them.

We believe we've achieved that with Soundblade's unmatched sound quality and its elegant, space-efficient design,\u201d BlueAnt founder Taisen Maddern claimed.\nSoundblade features a 120W peak power audio performance. It uses an 80mm neodymium subwoofer, dual neodymium drivers, dual voice coils, and single cone racetrack drivers.\nIt amplifies the power output while maintaining lower distortion levels to ensure that every note and sound effect \u201cis delivered with crystal-clear precision.\u201d\n\u201cWe've harnessed this design and technology to produce a sound that's not just heard but felt by the customer. This is our vision of bringing a cinematic audio experience right to your desktop, changing the way you interact with your favourite content,\u201d Maddern said.\n\u201cThe use of full range neodymium drivers allows for a more efficient and responsive audio experience. The integration of dual voice coils and racetrack drivers is a clever approach to enhance sound quality without compromising the sleek and slimline aesthetic of the device,\u201d Maddern added.\nThe Soundblade offers a range of connectivity options: auto switching USB-C, Bluetooth, and 3.5mm auxiliary input. It syncs with laptops, MacBooks, smartphones, or tablets.\nThe MSRP of the Soundblade is US$199.99 and is available in five colours.\nThe expected delivery date of the Soundblade in North America is on 15 February 2024.\nGARTNER MARKET GUIDE FOR NDR 2022\nDOWNLOAD NOW!\nPROMOTE YOUR WEBINAR ON ITWIRE\nMORE INFO HERE!\nKenn Anthony Mendoza\nKenn Anthony Mendoza is the newest member of the iTWire team.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0news of its new outdoor lights\u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song.\u00a0Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs? Done.\nWant to take your music out of your home and on the road? TechRadar's Senior Editor of Home Entertainment, Al Griffin, has you covered. He got to experience a Mercedes-Benz S 580 tricked out with a 4D sound system furnished by German manufacturer Burmester at CES. The 31-speaker Burmester 4D configuration is an option for the latest MBUX-generation infotainment system in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and it allows for Atmos-compatible tracks to be streamed in an immersive format from\u00a0Apple\u00a0Music and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0Music. How was it? Music on the road never sounded so good.\nNeed more newness?

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Set To Feature Brand New OZ SoundBlade Product From BlueAnt\nCES 2024 is shaping up to be a key event for the CE and appliance industry, with many global brands holding back on releasing new products in 2023, due in part to problems in China with manufacturers.\nInstead, brands are using 2024 as a launch year for new products with the likes of Samsung LG, TCL, Panasonic, and Harman set to use CES as a key launch platform for several new products which retailers are hoping will drive sales.\nOn the local front Melbourne based sound Company BluAnt are set to use CES 2023 to launch a new Soundblade, an under-monitor sound system that is set to revolutionise desktops.\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST) and this is when we will see the BluAnt Soundblade for the first time.\nFast growing TV company TCL is set to reveal a bendable, 8K 120 Hz OLED flexible TV that is capable of bending backwards at 90-degree angle.\nDue to its cost-cutting production method this prototype OLED has been described as greener, cheaper, and brighter than other OLED TVs on the market.\nAs is normal LG having LG lifted the lid on several new products prior to CES including the Ultra Gear OLED 34GS95QE, a forthcoming gaming monitor based around a 34-inch OLED panel.\nThe Ultra Gear OLED 34GS95QE will be launch early in 2024, along with least half a dozen new gaming monitors that are set to be shown at CES.\nThe monitor has already received an Innovation Award from CES 2024\u2019s organisers.\nLG has also announced its 2024 slate of soundbars, and they are promising an \u201celevated home cinema experience.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait to pass judgment on that part until we get to hear them.\nThe new 2024 soundbars comprise a triad \u2014 the S95TR, SG10TY, and S70TY. The latter two bring wireless connectivity to the midrange for the first time, thanks to an updated WOWCAST (which is found across all three models).\nSamsung Electronics has already announced that it will use CES to introduce Samsung\u2019s newest kitchen products, applications, and features, powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and SmartThings connectivity.\nNotable products and features in the lineup include the 2024 Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with AI Family Hub+ \u2014 which is the industry\u2019s first home Internet of Things (IoT) refrigerator launched in 2016.\nIt comes equipped with the all-new AI Vision Inside feature, the new Anyplace Induction Cooktop, and enhancements to the Samsung Food service.\n\u201cWe are both proud and excited to be showcasing these upgraded AI and connectivity features, which utilize the latest technology to help everyone take their food and kitchen experiences to the next level,\u201d said Moohyung Lee, EVP and Head of the Customer eXperience Team of the Digital Appliances Business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cWe are committed to letting users enjoy the many benefits of our innovative food ecosystem across a wide range of devices and features.\u201d\nAlso set to be announced by Samsung is a new range of Galaxy mobile products. These products are under strict NDA.\nMSI is getting ahead of CES 2024 by revealing a few of its most anticipated products before the big event.\nThe company is set to launch four QD-OLED gaming monitors in January, setting the tone for an event that should be packed with new monitor reveals.\nFor QD-OLED enthusiasts, the two most exciting announcements are a 32-inch 4K display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 27-inch 1440p display with a 360Hz refresh rate. These sizes and resolutions mirror the QD-OLED monitors Alienware recently teased new monitors which we also expect to see at CES 2024.\nOne product that I am keen to see is Lenovo\u2019s Smart Paper, which is more akin to the Kindle Scribe and reMarkable tablets, but with even more smart features.\nThe Lenovo Smart Paper is essentially an e-ink tablet that is meant to replace using pen and paper.\nIts touch display is matte and anti-glare as you\u2019d expect, and the surface feels paper-like, so the Smart Paper Pen that is included will feel no different than, well, an actual pen and paper.\nIt appears that the Lenovo Smart Paper has some features that make it stand out from the rest.\nFor example, it has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity with 23-millisecond latency and tilt detection.\nTo top it off, the pen also has nine pen settings, including ballpoint, pencil (wooden and mechanical), marker, calligraphy, and more \u2014 all completely customisable.\nThe tip of the pen also has a bit of physical resistance, making it feel much more like the thing it\u2019s trying to imitate compared to the competition. And going a step further, Lenovo\u2019s Smart Paper has audio recording capabilities to go with your notes, and you can tap anywhere on a note to play back the audio for context.\nThese are just some of the many products we will see at CES 2024, ChannelNews and SmartHouse will be on the ground so keep coming back for the latest news.\nSubscribe to our mailing list\nPopular Posts\nDigital Magazines\nCategories\nRecent Post\n02 9002 5900\n[email\u00a0protected]\nLevel 1, 275 Alfred Street\nNorth Sydney\nNSW 2060\nAustralia\nDigital Magazines\nTwitter"
