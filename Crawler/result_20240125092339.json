        "raw_content": "The Flappie AI cat door stops your pet from gifting you dead mice\nThe tradition of weird pet tech continues at CES 2024.\nFinding weird pet-related technology is a CES tradition, and this year is no exception. Take Flappie, for example. The Swiss start-up is showing off an AI-powered cat door that automatically locks if your kitty tries to bring in prey it caught from the outside.\nOn the side of the door facing the outside, you'll find a motion sensor and night-vision camera. Flappie says it has compiled a \"unique and proprietary\" dataset over the years, with a focus on diversity \u2014 this means getting lots of different kinds of cats as well as prey, filmed in a variety of different lighting conditions. The company says that its AI-powered detection system is accurate more than 90 percent of the time, which means your cat could still get a mouse inside. But hopefully that'll happen a lot less frequently.\nThere are some manual switches on the inside of the door so you can lock and unlock it any time you want as well as turn off the prey-detection system. Eventually, Flappie says that pets are likely to be trained that they can't enter when carrying something, and when they drop the prey the door will promptly unlock so they can get inside. (One of Flappie's co-founders admitted that a smart cat might figure out to drop the mouse, get the door open, pick it back up and then run in. But no solution is foolproof, right?)\nFlappie also included chip detection in its cat door. So if your pet has been microchipped, you can make it so the cat door only opens for your specific pet. And, of course, there's an app so you can control the door from your phone. But if you're not inclined to hook the Flappie door up to the internet, it'll still work via the controls on the door itself.\nFor starters, Flappie plans to launch its pet door in Switzerland and Germany later this spring, with plans to expand from there once it gets production scaled up. A US launch is part of the roadmap, but there's no word yet on when that'll happen, or how much the Flappie door might cost when it gets here. But a CES newsletter focused on Swiss tech companies says that Flappie will cost $399, or $199 with a two-year $8.90 monthly subscription to the app so you can see all the videos the door records of your pet.\nUpdate, January 8, 2024 12:45 PM ET: We've added pricing details on the Flappie to this story.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water. Coming out in the U.S. later this year, it will be priced somewhere up to $1000.\nSamsung fridge turned AI home hub\nSamsung has gone \u201call-in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its phones and home appliances. This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F. The result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIt uses artificial intelligence to monitor all aspects of the food, environment and cooking process. This includes the temperature and texture of the food.\nRobot vacuum phone home\nrobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to ability to call its owner, or have the owner call in remotely.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Swiss start-up Flappie has introduced this smart cat door which automatically locks itself if your feline friend tries to bring in prey it caught from the outside.\nThe innovative cat door is equipped with a motion sensor and night-vision camera on the exterior side, reports Engadget. The smart door uses AI technologies that boast over 90 percent accuracy in identifying prey brought by the cat. Flappie aims to reduce the frequency of such incidents while providing a secure entry point for your pets.\nThe Flappie app enables you to remotely manage the cat door through your phone\nThe AI-powered cat door features manual switches on the interior side, allowing users to lock and unlock it at will and deactivate the prey-detection system. Flappie envisions that, over time, pets will accept the fact that they shouldn\u2019t enter carrying something. Once they drop the prey, the door promptly unlocks, allowing them to enter. While acknowledging that clever cats might attempt to outsmart the system by dropping the prey, opening the door, picking it up again, and dashing inside, Flappie emphasizes the practicality and effectiveness of its solution.\nTo enhance security and personalize access, Flappie\u2018s cat door incorporates chip detection. It means that the door will be able to allow only your pet with a microchip and not any other animal. The system offers pet owners control through a dedicated app, enabling remote management via smartphones. For those who prefer not to connect the cat door to the internet, manual controls on the door itself provide a convenient alternative.\nFlappie plans to launch its AI-powered cat door initially in Switzerland and Germany in the coming spring, with further expansion on the horizon as production scales up. While a US launch is part of Flappie\u2019s roadmap, the company has not disclosed any specific details regarding timing and pricing for the said market.\nYet, a CES newsletter concentrating on Swiss tech companies indicates that Flappie plans to set the price of the AI-powered door at around $399 or offer it for $199 with a two-year $8.90 monthly subscription to the accompanying app, providing access to recorded videos of your pet\u2019s activities.\nCopyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines.

        "raw_content": "What to expect at CES 2024\nIt\u2019s the biggest consumer-technology conference on the planet and yet CES just keeps getting bigger. And this year, people who love to watch the trends will have plenty to look into.\nBestReviews is in Las Vegas to cover all of the newest and greatest products readying to launch, already on the market or trying to find a bigger reach. So before the madness really begins on Tuesday, we attended the media preview events to provide you a look into what you can expect to be leading the way this year at CES.\nArtificial intelligence, sustainability and inclusivity will lead the way\nThere are going to be three major buzzwords at this year\u2019s CES, according to the speakers at the Tech Trends to Watch event: AI, sustainability and inclusivity.\nThis has been the case in the market for some time, but the volume just seems to be getting louder. With AI in particular, its ascendence as the talking point in tech will be even more on display during CES. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that Microsoft announced just a couple days ago that it would be changing its keyboard for the first time in 30 years \u2014 to add an AI-copilot button, of course.\nIn many ways, AI will enable the other key trends in tech that will be on display this week. For example, inclusive designs were on display during the early exhibitions of the event. A prime example is Garmin rolling out a wheelchair mode for their popular Venu 3 smart watch.\nOn sustainability, the Paris Accords were signed in 2015, and with it comes commitments from countries around the globe to make significant investments in technology that will curb climate change. Companies are developing technologies that will help solve this massive issue.\nAfter walking around the exhibits at the CES Unveiled event, it was clear this was true. Almost everything fell into the above three categories.\nA sustainability product that caught our eye: The WaterCube by Genesis Systems\nDeveloped in Tampa, Florida, the WaterCube by Genesis Systems promises to take water from the air and turn it into pure fresh water. There are concerns about water availability in most parts of this country, and their sleek-looking machine could be the solution. It plugs into the same outlet you\u2019d plug your washer or dryer into and creates more than 100 gallons of water a day, working best in hot and humid climates.\nA focus on products for different stages of aging\nOutside of the main three trends, there\u2019s also a focus on products that meet the consumer where they are. Namely, products for Generation Z that make their smartphones more immersive (86% of Generation Z respondents in a survey said tech was essential to their lives); and products for older generations that ease the discomforts of aging.\nFocusing on the latter group, there was a significant focus on health and wellness technology that was personalized and intelligent.\nA product for making TV more enjoyable for people with hearing difficulties\nEver noticed how hard it is to get dialogue loud enough to actually hear what the characters on screen are saying? The Mirai speaker solves that problem by making content easier to hear without forcing people to crank their TVs up to full volume.\nThe product is designed with people experiencing hearing loss in mind. Its curved design allows the sound to be more evenly distributed and reach more areas of the room.\nIt\u2019s perfect for people who have a hard time hearing what they\u2019re watching when consuming TV or movies with others or for families who feel like one person requires the volume to be much louder than everyone else.\nThe TV as the center point of home life\nThe television already exists as the focal point of most living rooms. With technological advancements on the near horizon, it promises to unlock even more aspects of modern home life: From smart-home commands to becoming a platform for e-commerce transactions.\nAdditionally, gaming will be in focus as the industry continues to grow as consumers are expected to spend more in 2024 on software in the space.\nSamsung, a leader in all things TV, announced on Jan. 5 that its TVs will get an official video game controller at the event. We\u2019re excited to take a look at it and see if it will be popular to catch on where others who entered this space failed.\nOther top products that caught our eye during CES Unveiled\nAn improved cat door: The Flappie\nAnyone with a cat door will tell you the worst part of letting your outdoor cat inside is that they tend to bring you presents in the form of recently killed animals.\nThe Flappie, an AI-enabled cat door, won\u2019t unlock unless the cat lets go of the dead rodent (or whatever else it has in its mouth).\nIt\u2019s a fun idea backed by interesting technology that certainly fits the mold of utilizing innovative artificial intelligence to solve a real-life problem. The founder of the Flappie expects the product to launch to a wider consumer market by the end of the spring.\nSupercharged stroller: Gl\u00fcxKind\nParents are always looking for innovations to make everyday activities easier. Enter the Gl\u00fcxKind line of products, which features a stroller that has a hands-free mode where the buggy goes out in front of you as you carry the child and manage the dog or do whatever else that would make that useful.\nIt has a white noise machine built into it, powered auto assist (which makes it feel like you\u2019re operating an e-bike in terms of how little effort it takes to actually push the stroller), and you can enable an auto-rocking feature for when you want to have a moment to yourself and don\u2019t want to keep pushing your sleeping baby back and forth. Finally, it also has sensors and cameras all around the stroller so you can avoid environmental dangers.\nAre the features gratuitous? Maybe. But are they also intriguing for any exhausted new parent? Definitely.\nRobot lawn mowers are coming to your town\nAt BestReviews, we\u2019ve been reviewing robotic lawn mowers for years. The technology hasn\u2019t gone widespread quite yet, but we expect that will change in the upcoming years.\nThe Mammotion Luba 2 was the most appealing of any of the options on display at CES Unveiled because it was a sleek machine that didn\u2019t require intensive setup for it to navigate your yard. (Older models required you to stake your yard in certain ways to ensure it didn\u2019t wreak havoc).\nThe Luba models allow you to use similar technology to robot vacuums that automatically map your space and learn the contours of your yard automatically.\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting one of these ahead of spring and don\u2019t want to wait for the newest model, check out the Luba AWD 5000 on Amazon now.\nPersonal safety perfected: Swann ActiveResponse Personal Safety Alarm\nFitting in the theme of inclusivity and using tech to make people safer, Swann received an CES Innovation Award for its ActiveResponse Personal Safety Alarm, which takes the product type to another level \u2014 including options to sync with friends/family members\u2019 apps so they receive notifications for when/where the device was activated and then given options for how to respond, including sending law enforcement to the location.\nSign up here to receive the BestReviews weekly newsletter for useful advice on new products and noteworthy deals.\nJacob Palmer is the Sr. Director of Content\u00a0for BestReviews.

For it to be a main attraction at the recently concluded CES 2024 wasn\u2019t a big surprise.\nWhile AI was primarily seen in chatbots for the good part of the last year, we\u2019re now seeing it in a lot more products and being used in much more innovative - there\u2019s even a toothbrush with AI - ways. Some of the AI-related tech is pure hype, while others are actually useful products.\nHere are some of the most creative and fascinating ways in which AI was represented on the show floor at CES 2024.\nThe third batch of 10,000 rabbit r1 devices has sold out. Pre-orders for the fourth batch are available now at https://t.co/R3sOtVWoJ5 Expected delivery date is June - July 2024. pic.twitter.com/jFHD9688W9\nRabbit R1: The Rabbit R1 is a palm-sized device that wants to be the iPhone of AI. It can easily fit into your hand and answer all of your questions. It can launch Spotify, order a taxi, and do more, apart from answering questions. The Rabbit R1 wants to be your dedicated personal assistant (powered by AI). It\u2019s a walkie-talkie-looking device. \u201cAI agents\u201d are used to carry out tasks. This is a much cheaper alternative to the Humane AI Pin that made waves a few months ago.\nMotion Pillow: Who would have thought AI would have been helpful in making you sleep better? Say hello to the Motion Pillow, which is designed to tackle snoring problems and make sure you have a better night\u2019s rest, with the help of AI. Thanks to the use of an AI Motion System, the pillow detects a user\u2019s snoring. Once detected, the pillow slowly inflates, lifting the user\u2019s head and opening up their airways, which reduces snoring.\nThere\u2019s also an accompanying app with the Motion Pillow, which tracks sleep data (including snoring time), airbag operation time and the usual metrics - sleep score, sleep time etc. There\u2019s also a recording of the user\u2019s snoring that can be played back later. An accompanying Motion Ring \u2013 that monitors sleep status in real time and sends data to the motion system \u2013 is also part of this interesting package.\nBMind Smart Mirror: Barracuda\u2019s BMind smart mirror won the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the smart home category. It\u2019s powered by generative AI and can determine your mood. Once that is done, it can offer affirmations, visuals and more, to improve your mood. It combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to determine and analyse the sentiment of the user looking into the mirror through their expressions, gestures and tones. Thereafter, it adapts to your current mood and can even provide guided meditations, light therapy sessions and self-affirmations. The goal here is for the user to be able to better manage their stress.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: There\u2019s now a fitness tracker for your dog, in the form of Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar, which also helps you better understand what your dog needs. It\u2019s a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category. The tracker uses GPS to detect the dogs\u2019s location so that they never get lost. You also get various health statistics, including heart rate and breathing.\nNimble Beauty: Would you like a quality manicure in under 25 minutes? If yes, then Nimble Beauty\u2019s Nimble Device (which looks just like a printer) is for you. It\u2019s the first device that combines AI and robotics to paint nails, without the need for an appointment. Painting and drying of all 10 fingernails takes just 25 minutes.\nBallie: Samsung has brought its Ballie robot back, this time with a projector. The robot can project things onto the ceiling, floor or wall while following you around the house. Ballie was a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nTimekettle X1 Interpreter Hub: The X1 Interpreter Hub is designed for meetings -- \u201cthe world\u2019s first multi-language simultaneous interpretation system\u201d. The device leverages AI and provides real-time translations for up to 40 languages. It also shows live transcriptions on the screen.\nOclean X Ultra: Using AI to brush your teeth better? The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush is your ticket to healthier gums. This AI-powered toothbrush will give you real-time feedback (say, if you\u2019ve applied too much pressure or not brushing evenly) on your brushing habits and share tips on how to improve. The toothbrush itself will provide for up to 84,000 movements per minute.\nFlappie: Flappie is an AI-powered cat door. Thanks to motion sensors and AI vision technology, the device can spot whenever your feline friends try to bring unwanted small animals (prey) into the house.\nSwarovski Optic AX Visio: The Swarovski Optic AX Visio comes with a 13MP camera that can shoot HD videos. That\u2019s not what it is meant for though. These binoculars have AI on-board and can identify over 9,000 species of birds when pointed at them.\nCapella: An AI-powered baby cry translator from Cappella uses AI and machine learning to decipher an infant's needs - whether they\u2019re hungry, uncomfortable, tired or in need of a diaper change. It\u2019s a phone app and, in short, translates \u201ca baby\u2019s cries\u201d into useful information.\nOro Dog Companion Robot: It\u2019s as simple as the name suggests. The Oro Dog Companion Robot will provide company to your dog, while you\u2019re away. It has a two-way audio and video screen, allowing you to remotely interact with your pet. There\u2019s even a built-in dispenser to launch treats on command and a food bowl (for releasing food on schedule). Last but not least, there\u2019s a ball thrower mechanism for your dog to play fetch with.\nSahil Bhalla is a Delhi-based journalist.

        "raw_content": "10 of the strangest innovations we've spotted at CES 2024\n1, 2\nWith thousands of tech vendors showing off their wares at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas right now, it is only inevitable that some (or many) may seem a little, well, superfluous. From solving \"problems\" you've never really worried about to creating over-engineered gadgets for things that already have solutions, some of the offerings at this year's CES are, to put it mildly, a little odd.\nSo, what are some of the standout \"oddities\" from this year's CES? Let's find out.\n1. This weird-looking toothbrush can clean your teeth in seconds\nOne of the strangest innovations at this year's CES is the Y-Brush. Unveiled on the show's first day, this strange-looking device can, its developers claim, clean your teeth in just 10 seconds.\nStay ahead of your peers in technology and engineering - The Blueprint\nThe toothbrush has been created over three years and with the assistance of dental experts. Unlike regular toothbrushes, which clean teeth one at a time, the Y-Brush utilizes a clever, Y-shaped mouthpiece fitted with fine nylon bristles capable of cleaning all teeth simultaneously.\nThe bristles vibrate when you bite down on them, ensuring that every surface of the teeth, even the hard-to-reach spots, is cleaned thoroughly. This unique design claims to save time and provide an efficient brushing experience.\n2. This device is like Alexa for your toilet\nAnother odd innovation at CES 2024 is the Kohler Purewash E930 Bidet Seat. Priced at just over $2K, the PureWash E930 is the \"smart\" toilet bidet you never thought you needed.\nThe unique feature of PureWash E930 is its combination of convenience and sophistication - not something usually written about a toilet. It uses motion detection to automatically open and close the cover, providing a touchless experience. This smart seat has a built-in UV light and offers a self-cleaning mode, ensuring complete hygiene with every use. Pretty nifty.\nBut the standout feature of this \"smart\" bidet is its integration with voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Home. With this feature, you can control your toilet hands-free by using voice prompts to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, or UV cleaning. This feature is especially useful for those who may not have full use of their hands.\n3. Augmentel MouthPad^ looks weird but has an important function\nThe Augmental MouthPad^ has been on the market for some time but has made its first high-profile appearance at CES 2024. The MouthPad^ is a unique denture-style plate that allows users to control connected devices like phones and computers with their tongue. It's like a mouse for your mouth if you like.\nAlthough it may sound absurd at first, for individuals with disabilities that prevent them from using hand-operated controllers, this invention could be life-changing. The demonstration video is quite impressive, although it's difficult to see what's happening in the mouth to determine if there are any lag or accuracy issues.\n4. Mirokai\u00a0became a minor celebrity at CES 2024\nEnchanted Tools\nThe bright-orange robot Mirokai drew crowds as it interacted with attendees using its quirky virtual facial interface and funky mobility via a rolling globe.\u00a0Enchanted Tools intentionally designed Mirokai to appear friendly and approachable while avoiding the uncanny valley issue. This makes sense, given that Mirokai is meant to provide companionship and social therapy.\nWe are also digging its Manga-fox appearance and can see this being a big success. \"We are giving life to a new generation of robots, blending world-class engineering with captivating character design to enchant the world,\" explains its creators, Enchanted Tools.\n5. Why not let the Rabbit R1 do your \"doom scrolling\" for you?\nRabbit R1 is an AI device equipped with Rabbit OS, a natural-language operating system designed to enhance the online experience by consolidating multiple apps. Rabbit OS is powered by Rabbit's proprietary Large Action Model (LAM), allowing advanced human-machine interactions\nThrough training, the LAM can parse complex human intentions, allowing R1 to imitate human actions on various computer interfaces and operate seamlessly across different interfaces. The device can also perform various tasks within apps without requiring users to download multiple applications.\nThis marks a significant leap towards seamless and app-free online user interaction.\n6. Proxgy has reinvented the safety helmet with its SmartHat\nProxgy\nIf one invention had likely reached the zenith of its design capabilities, the safety helmet (aka \"hard hat\") would seem to be one of them. Until now.\nThe Proxgy SmartHat aims to revolutionize the traditional safety helmets used by industrial workers. The India-based company has created a waterproof hard hat with an infrared sensor-equipped front camera for capturing images and recording videos in low-light conditions. The hat also has a check-in function that alerts the wearer if it is not worn properly, as well as radio transmitting capabilities and volume control.\nSmartHat can detect multiple flammable and toxic gases. It also provides haptic feedback to alert the wearer of overhead objects and can measure vital and environmental factors such as heart rate, body temperature, noise, and humidity.\n7. Motion Pillow might be the smartest pillow ever made\n10minds co. ltd.\nSpeaking of products that probably don't need to be overengineered, here's another strange innovation from this year's CES 2024. Developed by 10mins, the Motion Pillow (and Vital Ring) claims to enhance the sleeping experience for individuals who snore or face breathing discomfort. This innovative product detects snoring sounds and measures oxygen saturation levels. Using seven airbags, it can dynamically adjust the position of the head and back, creating a comfortable breathing environment and reducing snoring.\nThe most recent model has been further enhanced, 10minds explains, with additional airbags, the addition of the 'vital ring' for measuring oxygen saturation, lighting to enhance circadian rhythms, and a space-saving charging system.\nIt also has an accompanying app that monitors your sleep data, including the time you spend snoring, airbag operation duration, sleep score, and sleep time. It even records your snoring for you to listen to later.\n8. Check out this cat blocking cat flap\nFlappie\nIf you are sick and tired of your pet cat leaving you animal carcasses as \"presents\", you might want to consider the Flappie. A highly sophisticated cat flap, Flappie comes with an AI detection system that prevents a cat from entering the house if it is carrying a mouse, bird, or any other small animal in its mouth.\nAdditionally, the door features a manual locking system that the homeowner can operate. There is also an option to ensure that the flap only opens for the specific microchipped pet of the owner.\nFlappie can be connected to the internet, allowing the user to operate the door and access camera footage through a smartphone app. The device is expected to retail for $399, but if the buyer opts for a two-year $8.90 monthly subscription to the smartphone app, the cost is reduced to $199 (for a two-year total cost of $412.60).\n9. Meet the Fufuly\u00a0\"breathing\" pillow\nYukai Engineering Inc. / Japan Tobacco Inc. / Hakuhodo Inc.\nFufuly is a robotic cushion that uses rhythmic pulsations to help people who hug it adjust their breathing, supposedly leading to a calm and restful state. The cushion takes advantage of the phenomenon of rhythmic synchronization between individuals or between individuals and objects, which may have behavioral effects.\nFor example, its creators explain, it can synchronize with a speaker's or listener's breathing rhythms, a baby's heartbeat, or a cradle's swings to, in theory, promote relaxation and a sense of well-being.\nFufuly gently stimulates the user's belly to induce slower and deeper breathing through simultaneous and rhythmic expansion and contraction. It is battery-operated and portable, making it easy to feel calm anytime, anywhere.\n10. WeHead GPT is a little weird\nAnd last but by no means least, meet WeHead GPT. A robotic head equipped with large language model (LLM) trained AI and two separate screens that simulate eyes and faces generated by AI, this \"gadget\" appears to be a thing of nightmares.\nWeHead, its creators explain, is intended to allow users to experience the presence of a virtual human or a digital clone of a person in the physical world. The \"AI agent\" can detect and interact with a user in a spontaneous and meaningful conversation. The AI agent can control a 3D device, move a robotic head around, and mimic human nonverbal communication.\nIt both sounds and looks more than a little creepy.\nAnd that's your lot for today.\nHave you spotted any other strange products at this year's CES? Let us know what you've seen."

It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display.

However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "World's most intelligent cat flap designed to stop unwanted dead guests unveiled at CES 2024\nA Swiss startup unveiled the world's most intelligent cat flap at CES 2024, and it's designed to stop your pet from bringing inside unwanted dead animals.\nWhacky pet tech is becoming a staple of CES, and this year is no different with the introduction of an AI-powered cat door capable of stopping your furry friends from bringing in unwanted gifts and keeping out other unwanted guests.\nSwiss start-up company Flappie Technologies came to CES this year to show off their new AI-powered cat door that will automatically lock your favorite felines outside if they try to bring in any prey they might have caught while outside. The fancy pet flap includes motion sensors on the side of the door facing outside, as well as a night-vision camera.\nFlappie claims it has gathered \"unique and proprietary\" datasets over the years and has a focus on diversity. This means the start-up filmed many different types of cats and prey in a variety of different lighting conditions to create their AI-powered detection system that now locks the cat flap if any prey is detected. Flappie says the detection system is accurate more than 90 percent of the time, meaning there is a chance a smart cat may be able to beat the system, though this will happen far less often.\nAlthough it is AI-powered, the cat door still has manual switches on the inside so that you can lock or unlock it at any time and turn off the prey-detection system. Flappie says that pets will likely catch on and realize they aren't able to enter while carrying something and will drop it, and when they do, the door will open. The company also included chip detection in the door, so if your pet is microchipped, you can allow the door to open for that specific pet, as well as an app allowing users to control the door from anywhere.\nFlappie plans to launch the pet door in Switzerland and Germany later this year with a price of $399, or $199 with a two-year plan on their $8.90 monthly subscription to the app. They have plans to expand from there once production begins to ramp up, although there is no word yet on a US release.\nThis isn't the only crazy tech that was unveiled at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as Samsung showcased Ballie, an AI-powered companion guard dog called Ballie. Additionally, there was the showcase of an AI-powered grill that can cook a steak in just 90 seconds, and also a mask that's designed to make private calls extra private.\nStarfield: Standard Edition - Xbox Series X\nJak Connor\nJak joined the TweakTown team in 2017 and has since reviewed 100s of new tech products and kept us informed daily on the latest science, space, and artificial intelligence news. Jak's love for science, space, and technology, and, more specifically, PC gaming, began at 10 years old. It was the day his dad showed him how to play Age of Empires on an old Compaq PC. Ever since that day, Jak fell in love with games and the progression of the technology industry in all its forms. Instead of typical FPS, Jak holds a very special spot in his heart for RTS games.\nWhat's in Jak's PC?\nSimilar News\nRelated Tags\n\u00a9 1999-2024 Tweak Town Pty Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nCES 2024 in Las Vegas is the place to see the latest and often the most surprising developments in consumer technology. Our team has searched high and low for the very best, highlighting our top picks with our 2024 CES Reviewed Awards.\nWe\u2019re also keeping an eye out for the new and unusual innovations. Here are some of the promising and sometimes quirky tech products from CES that we can\u2019t wait to test in 2024.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\nTurn up the heat on mosquito bites with Heat It\nNow doctor-approved.\nMosquitoes can ruin your time outdoors. The little bloodsuckers don\u2019t just steal blood; they leave saliva in the wound. Your allergic reaction to the bug drool causes the itchy misery. Anti-itch creams help but often aren\u2019t applied until it\u2019s too late.\nA fast, medication-free alternative that really worked has always been a pipe dream, but with their smart device, Heat It offers that solution, applying a dose of heat to the bug bite that stops the itch.\nWe were skeptical when we first heard about the device in 2023, as the scientific evidence for the tech was a little thin. Now Heat It is backed by a clinical trial showing it really can ease the symptoms.\nThe device plugs into your smartphone, you press it against the bite, and the accompanying app controls the dose of heat. You have to act fast for good results, and the heat can border on painful. Despite that, for most users, it probably beats days of discomfort, and we can\u2019t wait to try it out during bug season.\nDiscover the iPhone version of this mosquito bite healer\nThe mosquito bite healer is also compatible with Android smartphones\nMirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s my blood pressure today?\nYour health at a glance.\nWhat if you could get heart health data at a glance, or at least with a short video clip? Sounds too good to be true, but NuraLogix claims they can do just that with their Anura MagicMirror.\nThe idea isn\u2019t as far-fetched as it seems. The thin skin on our faces is translucent, and as blood pulses through the vessels there are subtle color changes. The MagicMirror uses cameras and sophisticated software to measure heart rate and blood pressure from color changes in video images.\nChanges in heart rate and blood pressure are linked to other factors, like stress and heart health. Those links are complicated, so the further you get away from basic measurements, the greater the chance of errors creeping in. Even so, we\u2019re excited about the possibilities of this new technology and look forward to testing it in 2024.\nGenesis makes it rain (kind of) with their water capture device\nNo need to wait for the rain anymore.\nImagine getting water direct from the atmosphere. I know what you\u2019re thinking: it\u2019s called rain. But what if you could get the water whenever you wanted and purified?\nThat\u2019s what Genesis offer with their WC-100 WaterCube, an innovation award winner at CES 2024.\nUnder the right conditions (80 degrees F and 60% relative humidity), the WaterCube can extract over 100 gallons of purified water from the air every day. Water is an increasingly scarce and expensive resource, so having a personal water supply for your house could be vital.\nAtmospheric water extraction is a great concept, but it comes at a cost. The WC-100 will retail at $19,995, and it\u2019s pretty energy-hungry. It uses 1 kWh per gallon of water produced and needs a beefy 220V electrical supply on a 40 Amp breaker.\nIf you\u2019re looking for off-grid self-sufficiency, the power demands call for a hefty solar or other renewable energy source. Despite this potential challenge, Genesis offers a forward-thinking solution to water scarcity with their advanced atmospheric water extraction technology.\nWalk this way, you\u2019re doing it wrong\nA new way to read your exercises.\nWhen it comes to exercise, fitness trackers mostly focus on quantity, not quality. The Evolve Mvmt, announced at CES 2024, goes far beyond counting your steps and encouraging you to move more \u2014 it promises to improve each step you take.\nEvolve Mvmt isn\u2019t a conventional fitness watch. It\u2019s worn on the ankle and measures the movement and impact of your foot while you walk. The device promises to use the data it collects to help you adjust your walking style\nThe impacts your feet experience during walking and running put a lot of strain on your joints and muscles, potentially leading to injury. The Mvmt gives real time feedback on how you\u2019re moving, encouraging a walking style they\u2019re calling \u201clight walking\u201d which aims to smooth out the bumps, improve your posture, and burn more calories.\nThere\u2019s still a lot to learn about this product, but that\u2019s why we have test labs. Another CES debut we\u2019ll be trying out in 2024.\nThe Flappie AI powered cat door lets your cat in but keeps other critters out\nYour cat will thank you for this one.\nCats are great. They\u2019re cute and affectionate, and only occasionally cough up hairballs on your stuff. Let them outside, though, and they\u2019ll be catching and bringing home a choice selection of dead wildlife in no time.\nIf you have an outdoor cat and the charm of finding dead mice in your home has worn off, Flappie Technologies has the solution you need with their smart cat flap.\nThe Flappie uses cameras and AI to figure out if your beloved cat is trying to carry a dead mouse indoors. If the AI detects a mouse, it locks the door until kitty spits out its prey. Finally, AI delivers on the promise to make our lives better.\nIt\u2019s not clear when Flappie will be available to buy in the US, but as soon as it is, we\u2019re eager to test it.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.

        "raw_content": "Astounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nThe world's biggest consumer tech show lets us dream of a Jetsons-style world where these futuristic concepts come to pass.\nLooking to the future\nCES 2024 is a candy-colored box of goodies. While you can certainly buy some of the wares at the show, some of the most intriguing tech concepts trumpeted at CES are visions of the future we wish were already real. (Others were straight-up wacky.) Here's what's sparking our imagination.\nTalking, color-changing BMW\nRemember KITT, the talking car from Knight Rider? It's getting closer to reality thanks to Dee, a talking, color-changing BMW concept car displayed at CES. It will listen and respond to commands from curbside, as well as remotely via a smartphone app. Plus, the concept's exterior skin is covered with new full-color E Ink technology that can instantly shift between up to 32 colors, allowing you to generate patterns and multicolor schemes on the fly to customize your ride.\nSelf-service airport screening pods\nAirport security lines are never fun, and they can be so long they result in travelers missing their flights. Thankfully, the Transportation Security Administration is testing a new self-service system that could let you complete the screening process on your own. The self-service screening pods are for TSA PreCheck passengers to use as individual screening consoles. When a passenger steps inside the screening pod, they show their ID and the machine will begin scanning them and their bags. Each station includes a video monitor with step-by-step instructions. The prototype that's being shown at CES this week is the Micro-X self-screening system.\nJackery solar Mars bot and rooftop camper\nJackery displayed two concept items -- one more practical than the other. The company showed off a \"Mars rover\" with solar panels. The Solar Generator Mars Bot is like a portable power station on wheels with solar panels sliding out of the sides to capture more sunlight, somewhat like NASA's Opportunity Rover, with power outlets. And a more practical item on display was the company's rooftop camper tent. Solar panels mounted inside the hardshell roof of the pop-up tent and extending wings of panels can provide power through one of the company's power stations, running plenty of camping equipment for long journeys.\nKia's Lego-like concept vehicles\nKia debuted three concept vehicles at CES 2024: the PV1, PV5 and PV7, the automaker's new Platform Beyond Vehicle family. They are electric vans that can be customized to move products, serve as work or living spaces, be converted to modular pop-up stores, and operate with or without a driver behind the wheel. Think Legos for vehicles -- they can be reconfigured almost at will.\nHyundai's steering tech\nThe Hyundai Mobion concept vehicle moves unlike any other vehicle you've probably seen. The newly developed eCorner steering technology uses advances in robotics technology to allow the vehicle to move laterally, rotationally, and do all sorts of crazy things. The wheels can be moved independently, but also in multiple different configurations. The car can even crab walk, and it can do rear-wheel steering on a level that we've almost never seen before. Hyundai hopes to begin shopping the tech around in 2025 or so.\nQuantum dot-powered TV of the future\nNanosys has created a prototype 12.3-inch nanoLED screen that could be thinner, brighter and more efficient than OLED. What's nanoLED, you ask? It's a technology based on electroluminescent, aka \"direct-view\" quantum dots, and its screens boast improved picture quality, energy savings and manufacturing efficiency. While the screens can't quite be made in TV size yet, the new prototypes are big enough for tablets, small laptops and automotive uses.\nHyundai's electric air taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the CES debut of the Supernal S-A2. Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing Supernal displayed its new, second-generation S-A2, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, air taxi. It'll take to the air as early as 2028, the company said.\nDoublepoint Android watch software\nA Finnish startup created some impressive software, called Doublepoint, that turns your smartwatch running Android's WatchOS into a kind of remote control you can wear on your wrist.\nIt makes your watch a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection. You may be able to dim your lights, scroll Netflix or do any number of other things.\nHisense projector concept car\nHisense doesn't make cars, but the company is demonstrating its laser TV in-car technology at CES. CNET's\u00a0David Katzmaier calls it\u00a0\"basically a drive-in movie theater built into your car.\" There's a laser projector right on the front bumper -- you could project a movie straight from your car onto a flat surface, like your garage door. Inside the car, you can turn the windshield into an information hub, allowing drivers to simultaneously observe virtual images and the real environment.\nSamsung transparent micro-LED\nTransparent OLED\u00a0and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, but Samsung says its micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the going tech. That means you should be able to see through it more easily to objects on the other side.\nOne intriguing use: One day, you could be in a luxury box at an athletic event or concert looking through this transparent micro-LED glass. Scores, replays and highlights could appear on the \"windows\" and augment the experience of the game without obscuring it. (You're still on your own for getting those luxury box tickets, however.)\nSamsung's flip phone concept\nSamsung's Flex In & Out Flip concept is like a Galaxy Z Flip you can fold in both directions. Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and other flip phones you can buy today, it folds completely backward so that you use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nLG DukeBox\nIf you've ever wanted to sync up The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the LG DukeBox might be just the device for you. It's a 360-degree speaker with a transparent OLED panel at the front to show off the tube amplifier inside. LG says the screen can be used to watch movies or \"create a cozy fireplace ambiance where the vacuum tube is visible amidst the flickering flames.\"\nLG concept car\nLG has a car? It's just a concept for now, but this futuristic beauty features completely autonomous driving, seats that turn completely around, and of course, plenty of screens. It also works with LG's smart home system, and there's a video game system and concierge station that holds a wine bottle. AR displays give you information on businesses you're passing as the car drives you around.\nSamsung rollable OLED\nImagine\u00a0Samsung's flexible rollable OLED display technology\u00a0inside your car. These screens offer small, unobtrusive displays when you're driving, but when you need to charge your electric vehicle, you can fold out the screen to a larger size for movie watching or playing games. It folds right back up to the size of a chunky highlighter when you're done.\nStained glass solar panels\nThink you know what solar panels look like? Think again. This crystal isn't just an art object but a solar panel capable of turning sunlight energy into power. Extra points for not looking like a giant, unsightly black box.\nProject Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept for a gaming chair cushion. Project Esther, an add-on cushion unveiled at CES, is the first demonstration that Razer has offered of the new technology, which comes via its acquisition of Interhaptics in 2022. It straps on to a chair and creates sensations to let you feel as if you're really experiencing the game you're playing.\nPanasonic's novel solar cells\nPanasonic has a plan to one day turn walls and windows into solar energy. The new solar technology, perovskite, uses different materials than traditional silicon solar panels. The fact that the materials are printed onto walls and windows means Panasonic can manufacture components at much lower temperatures -- which saves energy -- and the solar cells themselves have the potential to one day capture as much energy as traditional solar panels, if not more.\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda gave CES attendees their first peek at its next generation of battery electric cars, the Honda 0 (pronounced \"zero\") series, expected to launch in the US in 2026. Shown here is the\u00a0sharply styled 0 Series Saloon, the flagship model.\nIt will be joined by the more upright and van-shaped Honda 0 Space-Hub, featuring a transparent canopy and center-facing bench seats.\nMore Galleries\nSteak Toasters, Indoor Smokers and Robot Cocktails: All the Kitchen Tech of CES 2024\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nThe Rabbit R1 AI Assistant Looks Downright Retro in Orange\nOnePlus 12 and 12R Have an Elegant but Familiar Design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\n17 Hidden iOS 17 Features and Settings on Your iPhone"
