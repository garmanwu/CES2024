The appearance at the annual event is a key and strategic step in its globalization roadmap for 2023. The firm unveiled a range of new e-bike models at the exhibition, including Innovator, URider S and Trooper 01, with the aim of revolutionizing the travel experience for bike riders across North America.\nThis is following by Yadea's successful participation in EUROBIKE and EICMA in 2022 when the brand showcased a number of new electrically-powered motorcycles, bicycles, mopeds, and kick scooters and drew the attention of dealers.\nYadea's three exhibits of two-wheelers using its proprietary intelligent motor technology became highlights of CES 2023\nYadea Group started producing e-bikes five years ago and built an R&D team with graduates from Tsinghua University. Of note is that 90% of the motors installed in its e-bikes were developed in-house.\nYadea's proprietary intelligent motor comes with\u00a0a maximum torque of 100Nm and a multi-sensor integrated algorithm that can accurately determine the rider's intention, with the torque sensor accuracy reaching 0.01Nm. With no internal connectors, the motor has the least number of parts in the industry, minimizing\u00a0the possibility of interference while making it easier to repair and replace.\nNotably, Innovator,\u00a0which received the IDEA Bronze Award and Japan's Good Design Award,\u00a0features a magnesium monocoque casting body, as well as front and rear single-arm design, folding size down to 9.535 feet in tandem with an\u00a0exclusive design for the\u00a0storage mount, all of which come together to deliver an outstanding travel experience and make it the ideal transportation tool for commuters. In addition, Innovator also leverages\u00a0Yadea's proprietary TorqueTronic technology to\u00a0enhance the riding experience by making the gear change smoother.\nURider S comes equipped with a large capacity and high-density LG18650 lithium battery, a 48V 3 Amp fast charger (4-5 hour charging) as well as front and rear racks with large loading capacities.\nOne of the highlights of Trooper 01 is its similarity to a straddle motorcycle in terms of appearance. The e-bike comes loaded with powerful high-energy density lithium cells\u00a0in addition to wide tires and superior disc brakes that ensure a safe riding experience even on bumpy and poorly paved roads.\nFurthermore, the solution comes in a twin-motor 1,000W version and a single-motor 750W version, both boasting\u00a0the Electronic Limited Slip Differential (ELSD) technology that delivers better safety performance by preventing slippage loss of control during starting and climbing. The dedicated TFT-LCD display enables real-time status display of the front and rear motors. The rider can easily switch between the vehicle's multiple modes, including front single drive, rear single drive, timely dual drive and full-time dual drive.\u00a0With functionalities that can be customized according to personal preferences, the e-bike delivers a more entertaining and novel\u00a0riding experience.\nYadea enters the US market with the rollout of new two-wheelers ideal for medium- or short-haul travel\nTo capitalize on the expansive opportunities brought about by the rapid growth of the US market, Yadea plans to roll out a series of local marketing campaigns championing Trooper 01, URider S and Innovator this year, with the aim of driving the brand's growth in the market by supporting and collaborating with its local partners.\nAt the same time, Yadea has been building and expanding its presence across multiple channels. Besides the launch of its official website for e-bike products (https://store.yadea.com), the company has also built e-bike logistics facilities and aftersales warehouses in several Western and Midwestern states in the US in a move to provide timely aftersales support. The e-bike maker also sought to expand the dealership network by attracting investment at this year's CES.\nYadea is confident that with the combination of quality, technologies and services, the firm is well-positioned to provide extraordinary products and services to local consumers in the near future while enhancing the experience for e-bike users.\nAbout Yadea\nTo date, Yadea, the world's largest and best-selling two-wheeler brand, has sold products to 70+ million users in over 100 countries and regions, and has a network of 40,000+ retailers worldwide. Notably, the firm has led in sales among the world's two-wheeler makers for five consecutive years. With its brand mission of \"Electrify Your Life\", the world's leading developer and manufacturer of electrical two-wheelers continues to invest in R&D, production and global expansion to build a shared and sustainable future for mankind.\nSOURCE Yadea\nModal title\nAlso from this source\nYadea Showcases Latest in E-mobility for Sustainable Urban Travel at CES 2024\nYadea, a pioneering global technology company specializing in two-wheeled e-mobility, unveiled Yadea Artist and Yadea Cocoa at CES 2024, exemplifying ...\nSpole\u010dnost Yadea na veletrhu CES 2024 potvrdila sv\u00e9 maxim\u00e1ln\u00ed nasazen\u00ed v oblasti ekologick\u00e9ho \u017eivotn\u00edho stylu p\u0159i doj\u00ed\u017ed\u011bn\u00ed do pr\u00e1ce\nSpole\u010dnost Yadea (01585.HK), revolu\u010dn\u00ed glob\u00e1ln\u00ed technologick\u00e1 spole\u010dnost specializuj\u00edc\u00ed se na jednostop\u00e9 dopravn\u00ed prost\u0159edky v oblasti e-mobility,...\nExplore\nTransportation, Trucking & Railroad\nAutomotive\nTrade Show News\nNew Products & Services\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"

        "raw_content": "CloudHQ plotting 4 million sq ft campus in Ashburn, Virginia\nDulles Berry project requests permission to expand zoning from 1m to 4m sq ft of data center space\nA company with connections to CloudHQ is looking to develop up to 4 million sq ft of data center buildings on a 96.8-acre site in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nFirst reported by DgtlInfra, the county Planning & Zoning commission is considering a proposal to increase allowed data center use on the Dulles Berry project site in Ashburn from 1,671,000 square feet (155,00 sqm) to a maximum of ~4,050,000 sq ft (376,000 sqm) and grant a Zoning Concept Plan Amendment (ZCPA) and Special Exception (SPEX) in order to allow the change.\nThe site, at the intersection of Loudoun County Parkway (Route 267) and Shellhorn Road (Route 643), was seemingly once part of the larger 350-acre Du Pont-owned tract around 2010. The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts. The site is features Digital Realty data center campuses to the west and north.\nDuPont Fabros Technology co-founder and CEO Hossein Fateh stepped down from the company in February 2015, and in 2016 founded CloudHQ. The company says it has built and leased 2.4 million square feet and 320MW of data center capacity since its formation. In 2020 Fateh formed Cloud Capital to acquire, manage, develop, and operate data centers.\nCloudHQ has existing and planned data center developments in Ashburn and Manassas, Virginia; London, UK; Milan, Italy; Frankfurt, Germany; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.
