        "raw_content": "SK hynix Envisions an AI-Powered World at CES 2024\nThe world\u2019s largest tech companies have descended on the Las Vegas Convention Center to showcase their latest innovations at Consumers Electronics Show (CES) 2024. Dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful tech event\u201d, CES 2024 opened its doors on January 9 and is welcoming more than 4,000 exhibitors and thousands of visitors through January 12.\nFigure 1. SK Wonderland features various amusement park-themed attractions\nAlongside six other SK Group affiliates, SK hynix is inviting guests to SK Wonderland, an amusement park-themed showroom where visitors can experience a net-zero world free from climate change. Within SK Wonderland stands SK hynix\u2019s booth, which features industry-leading AI solutions and an innovative AI fortune teller.\nFueling the Generative AI Revolution With Next-Generation Memory Solutions\nFigure 2. The AI fortune teller sits at the center of SK hynix\u2019s booth\nAs AI continues to advance and permeate various aspects of our daily lives, demand is increasing for high-performance memory which can handle the growing requirements of these AI systems. In response, SK hynix developed groundbreaking memory solutions including the world\u2019s best performing HBM3E, the fifth generation of High Bandwidth Memory1 (HBM).\nFigure 3. SK hynix\u2019s leading HBM3E solution presented at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, visitors to SK hynix\u2019s booth can discover the vast potential and applications of HBM3E. Offering the industry\u2019s highest data processing speed of 1.18 terabytes (TB) per second, HBM3E satisfies the AI market\u2019s need to rapidly process vast amounts of data. Compared to its predecessor HBM3, HBM3E is 1.3 times faster and provides 1.4 times more data capacity. The product also offers a 10% improvement in heat dissipation by adopting cutting-edge Advanced MR-MUF2\u00a0technology. SK hynix is set to mass produce HBM3E in the first half of 2024, allowing customers to soon realize the full potential of their AI systems.\n1High Bandwidth Memory (HBM): A high-value, high-performance product that possesses much higher data processing speeds compared to existing DRAMs by vertically connecting multiple DRAMs with through-silicon via (TSV).\n2Advanced Mass Reflow-Molded Underfill (MR-MUF): MR-MUF is a process in which semiconductor chips are stacked and a liquid protective material is injected into the space between the chips and then hardened to protect the chips and the surrounding circuitry. Advanced MR-MUF offers advantages in terms of controlling the thickness of wafers, evenly splicing chip bumps, and filling spaces between chips.\nFigure 4. SK hynix\u2019s groundbreaking AI memory technology on display\nAlongside HBM3E, SK hynix also presented its Compute Express Link3\u00a0(CXL) interface, a test Computational Memory Solution4\u00a0(CMS) product, and its Accelerator-in-Memory based Accelerator5\u00a0(AiMX). In particular, CXL has been in the spotlight for its ability to enable memory expansion and improve the performance of AI applications, and is set to play a key role alongside HBM3E in the age of AI.\n3Compute Express Link (CXL): A PCIe-based next-generation interconnect protocol on which high-performance computing systems are based.\n4Computational Memory Solution (CMS): A product that integrates computational functions into CXL memory.\n5Accelerator-in-Memory based Accelerator (AiMX): SK hynix\u2019s accelerator card product that specializes in large language models using GDDR6-AiM chips.\nDealing the AI Tarot Cards of Destiny\nFigure 5. Visitors find out their fortunes for 2024 at the AI fortune teller exhibit\nThe centerpiece of SK hynix\u2019s booth is the AI fortune teller. Inspired by the animatronic fortune telling machines found in U.S. amusement parks, SK hynix\u2019s fortune teller brought the concept into the AI era. The AI fortune teller scans a visitor\u2019s face before printing out a cartomancy tarot card featuring their animated image. The interactive exhibition allows visitors to discover their new year\u2019s fortunes and experience first-hand the potential of AI.\nSharing the Future of AI\nFigure 6. SK hynix\u2019s President and CEO Kwak Noh-Jung gives a presentation at the company\u2019s CES 2024 press conference\nIn addition to showcasing its groundbreaking AI memory products, SK hynix also shared its thoughts on the future of AI. At a press conference held a day before CES 2024 kicked off, SK hynix\u2019s President and CEO Kwak Noh-Jung gave a presentation on the company\u2019s vision for the upcoming memory-centric AGI6\u00a0era.\nKwak opened by underlining how the performance and advancement of AI systems is largely reliant on the memory which supports them. As AI technology accelerates the transition to a data-centric age, memory solutions need to offer higher capacity, faster processing, and lower power consumption. SK hynix is responding to this move toward a memory-centric market by continuing to develop world-best products which will cement its industry leadership. These solutions include the upcoming HBM4 and HBM4E which will offer increased bandwidth, as well as LPCAMM7, CXL, and PIM8 and CIM9\u00a0products.\n6Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A theoretical form of AI research that aims to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach.\n7Low Power Compression Attached Memory Module (LPCAMM): A compact memory module standard used in laptops, PCs, and data centers which offers improvements in performance and power efficiency.\n8Processing-In-Memory (PIM): A next-generation technology that adds computational capabilities to semiconductor memories to solve the problem of data movement congestion in AI and big data processing.\n9Computing-in-Memory (CIM): A memory management solution that aims to improve speed and efficiency by performing computations directly in the memory.\nRounding off his presentation, Kwak announced that the company is developing a new custom memory platform which will harness its AI memory technology and research capabilities to create optimized solutions tailored for each customer\u2019s strengths.\nA Trailblazer During the Rise of AI\nAt CES 2024, SK hynix has cemented its position as the world\u2019s leading AI memory provider. SK hynix\u2019s booth gives visitors a glimpse into the significant possibilities of its industry-leading solutions, and the company will continue to demonstrate how its products can build a brighter future for all over the coming year.\nRelated Posts\n[CES 2024 Video] Experience an AI-Powered World With SK hynix\nQ4 2023 Earnings Conference Call Invitation\nSK hynix to Exhibit AI Memory Leadership at CES 2024\nPioneering Excellence in 2023\nSubscribe\nCopyright \u00a9 SK hynix inc.
