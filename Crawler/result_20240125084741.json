These awards are a testament to our commitment to design, produce and deliver superior products that are an essential part of our customers' lives.\"\u2013Susan\u00a0Lyman, Garmin Vice President, Global Consumer Marketing\nThe award-winning Garmin products and their respective categories include:\nVenu 3\u00a0Best of Innovation Winner; Sports & Fitness Category Honoree; Accessibility Category Honoree\nFeaturing extensive fitness insights, beautiful AMOLED touchscreen displays and an impressive battery life of up to 14 days, the Venu 3 smartwatch series helps users get a more complete picture of their health.

Choose from two different font sizes for optimized readability with the new Large Font Mode and take phone calls or respond to text messages right from the watch thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone (when paired with a compatible smartphone).\nMARQ Golfer\u2014Carbon Edition\u00a0Wearable Technologies Category Honoree\nThe pinnacle of premium materials, luxury and performance, the MARQ Golfer\u2014Carbon Edition is a modern tool watch machined from 130 layers of Fused Carbon Fiber\u2122\u00a0making it the lightest and strongest MARQ watch yet. Featuring a stunning AMOLED touchscreen display and domed sapphire lens, expertly crafted materials \u2013 including a perforated FKM leather strap \u2013 and up to 16 days of battery life, this timepiece is ready for adventures both on and off the course.

The Garmin Venu 3, Epix Pro, and MARQ Golfer Carbon Edition were all selected as awardees in various categories.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nLooking ahead to 2024, Garmin announced the Lily 2 smartwatch, HRM-Fit clip-on heart rate monitor, and a redesigned Garmin Connect experience coming soon to the smartphone app and website.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nGarmin Lily 2 series\nThe Lily 2 is designed for those who want a smaller wearable that coordinates well with your style and fashion while still providing all of the essential Garmin health and wellness features. The Lily 2 series is available as the Lily 2 and Lily 2 Classic with prices starting at $249.99 and $279.99, respectively.\nThe Lily 2 watches have metal cases with a 35mm diameter and patterned glass lenses with a touchscreen display. A variety of colorways and band materials are available with the Your Watch, Your Way customization feature found when you order from the Garmin website directly.\nAlso: The best fitness rings right now\nGarmin health and wellness features include Body Battery, sleep score, fitness tracking (including popular forms of dance), workouts and sports with connected GPS functionality, and women's health tracking. Garmin Pay is also available on the Lily 2 Classic watch.\nHRM-Fit\nWhile wrist-based heart tracking has improved significantly over the years, chest and arm straps provide better accuracy. Garmin's new HRM-Fit heart rate monitor is designed for women with its unique clip-on design that attaches to medium and high-support sports bras. Chest straps are not always the most comfortable monitors to wear so this new monitor is designed to provide accurate heart rate tracking without the discomfort of a chest strap.\nThe HRM-Fit has a clip on either end of the monitor to help hold the center heart rate sensor against the front of your body. It connects to Garmin smartwatches, Edge bike computers, and compatible fitness equipment. A benefit of using an external heart rate monitor like this is that you can capture and store your workout data (steps, calories burned, intensity minutes, and heart rate) without having your watch in range since there are some sports where a watch is not practical.\nThe HRM-Fit is available now for $149.99. The replaceable battery can provide this heart rate data for up to a year.\nAlso:\u00a0The best Garmin watches you can buy\nGarmin Connect redesign\nOne of the primary reasons that I use Garmin watches is the fantastic Garmin Connect experience found on smartphones and via the website. We've seen some minor improvements in Garmin Connect over the years, but Garmin will soon be rolling out beta versions of its redesigned app and website that provide a simpler and more customizable home page.\nThe same Home, Challenges, Calendar, News Feed, and More tabs are present along the bottom, but the data shown on the pages looks to be improved with a cleaner look that also provides key data like a countdown clock to your race, training plan status, challenge status, and much more. The press images of the redesign look great and I will soon be opting into the beta to test out the new functionality with my various Garmin devices.\nThe panels look to provide easily glanceable details that were previously only seen when you tapped into each metric. The At a Glance functionality should make using the app much more efficient with fewer manual interactions required to check your stats.\nRelated\nThe best Garmin watches of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\nThe best smartwatches of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most"

The Epix Pro, on the other hand, is Garmin\u2019s latest innovation in the realm of multi-sport GPS watches. It boasts advanced features like a high-resolution, sunlight-readable display and extended battery life for the most demanding outdoor activities.\nThe Samsung Health app significantly marked Samsung\u2019s presence, securing the Honoree Award in the Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps category at the CES Innovation Awards. This recognition underscores the app\u2019s contribution to personal health management through its comprehensive and user friendly wellness features. In the realm of sports and fitness, the Galaxy Watch 6 Series received accolades for its blend of style, health monitoring capabilities, and enhanced connectivity features. The Galaxy Buds FE also earned recognition in the Headphones & Personal Audio category, applauded for their sound quality and innovative features like active noise cancellation and ambient sound options.\nEssential reading:\u00a0Best fitness trackers and health gadgets\nAnother notable mention is the Evie Ring by Movino Health, an Honoree in the Wearable Technologies category.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting. Users can store around 1,700 photos or one hour of video in full quality, which you can then download to smartphones or devices.\nThe high-tech binoculars will be unsurprisingly expensive,\u00a0costing $4,799 when they are released in\u00a0February.\nRelated: Best binoculars for wildlife spotting 2024\nThe HRM-Fit sports bra heart rate monitor\nGarmin announced a new $149.99 heart rate monitor at CES called the HRM-Fit. It's designed for people to attach to sports bras from a wide range of manufacturers, including Adidas and Athleta. It can capture training data like ground contact time balance and stride length, as well as real-time heart rate, without compromising movement or performance.\nThe device then transmits this information to other fitness devices like Garmin smartwatches or Edge cycling computers, as well as compatible fitness apps like Tacx Training.\nUsers will need a compatible Garmin device to get the most out of the HRM-Fit, but even without one, the HRM-Fit can capture information on steps, calories burned, intensity minutes and all-day heart rate.\nRelated: Best fitness trackers 2024"

The Japanese automaker has communicated to suppliers its intention to achieve a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in parts pricing when the next-generation crossover enters production in 2026. This move comes as Nissan seeks to cut costs, with reports indicating that the company has asked suppliers to reduce the cost of parts by an average of 20%, with some suppliers being asked for reductions of up to 30%.\nThe Smyrna, Tennessee-built Rogue holds a crucial position as Nissan\u2019s best-selling model in the American market. With around 6,700 workers, the Smyrna facility heavily relies on the production of the Rogue, as approximately 40% of the factory\u2019s output comprises this model. The potential relocation of Rogue production to Japan could leave the Tennessee plant in a vulnerable position, especially considering the impending cessation of production for the Nissan Leaf, another key model produced at the facility.\nMoreover, the move could be influenced by the company\u2019s efforts to reduce costs amidst potential increases in operational expenses, possibly linked to unionization efforts. Industry analysts have expressed surprise at the magnitude of the price reduction being sought and the potential threat of moving an entire vehicle\u2019s production to another country. This decision could have far-reaching consequences, as it may not only impact the Tennessee factory but also affect Nissan\u2019s broader operations in the United States.\nAs the automaker evaluates revised quotations for the new Rogue, a decision is expected to be made in February. However, industry experts believe that if Nissan proceeds with moving Rogue production to Japan, it could spell financial trouble for Nissan USA, potentially leading to the closure of a plant. The outcome of this decision is crucial not only for Nissan but also for the future landscape of automotive manufacturing in the United States.\nStay tuned for updates as Nissan executives prepare to make their final decision on the fate of the Rogue\u2019s production.\nhttps://carbuzz.com/news/nissan-ready-to-pull-the-plug-on-american-rogue-production\nShare this:\nRelated\nAutomotive\n5 Ways to Protect Your Automotive Investment\nPublished\non\nBy\n(Family Features) Between inventory issues and climbing interest rates, buying a vehicle can be quite an ordeal, making it an investment worth protecting.\nToday\u2019s vehicles require less maintenance than ever before. You can go longer between oil changes and many tires are rated for longer travel. However, keeping up with regular maintenance remains part of your vehicle\u2019s upkeep.\nWhether you\u2019ve purchased a new vehicle or you\u2019re aiming to keep a car or truck you already own in good working condition, these tips can help you maintain its peak performance and appearance.\nCar Wash: At least once a month, make a point of washing your car to remove built up grime. Not only is the dirt unsightly, but the mess can also damage your paint job and even the frame. This is especially true during the winter months when road salt splatters your vehicle\u2019s undercarriage. Once the temperatures climb back above freezing, be sure to wash away the salt.\nCovered Parking: When possible, use a garage or other form of covered parking. You\u2019ll protect your paint job from harsh UV rays, and you\u2019ll also limit exposure to bird droppings and other potentially corrosive or damaging elements in the environment, like dust and pollen.\nWindshield Wipers: Visibility is one of the most important aspects of safety when you\u2019re driving, and windshield wiper blades play an essential role. Squeaking, streaking and failing to clear precipitation are all signs your blades need to be replaced. Check wipers regularly and plan on replacing them at least every 6-12 months.\nBattery: You may not think much about your battery as long as your engine is turning over and your vehicle is running smoothly. However, even a car in good condition can have battery damage. At least once a year, check for signs of battery acid. If you detect the white powdery substance around your battery terminals, disconnect the cables (negative first) and apply a mixture of baking soda and water with a wire brush. Rinse with water and dry before replacing the cables.\nAir Filter: The air filter doesn\u2019t just affect the air quality in the cabin of your vehicle. A dirty filter can also cause engine strain because it hinders proper air flow. Over time, you may even notice a decline in gas mileage and acceleration performance. Many factors affect how often you need to replace your filter, but a quick visual inspection should give you a clear idea. Your owner\u2019s manual will help you determine how to access the filter; it\u2019s easier than people often assume.\nFind more practical tips for auto care at eLivingtoday.com.\nPhoto courtesy of Unsplash\nSOURCE:Family Features\nShare this:\nRelated\nAutomotive\n3 Tips to Take Control of Car Maintenance\nPublished\non\nBy\n(Family Features) Economic factors made 2023 a record year for motorists, but not in ways that helped most families\u2019 household budgets.\nThe average price of a new car peaked at nearly $50,000 while the average age of cars on the road surpassed 12 years, a record, according to S&P.\nRising costs for new cars and an aging fleet of vehicles on the road go hand-in-hand and, for most drivers, this means staying on top of vehicle maintenance is crucial. Yet even maintenance has become more difficult as the cost of parts and labor increase, leaving drivers with a sometimes daunting list of automotive DIY projects or parts to source when their mechanic is out of stock.\nCommon Fears About Automotive DIY For people new to car maintenance and repair, getting started can feel overwhelming. Because many families count on their cars to get where they need to go, it seems like a lot could go wrong with an average of 30,000 parts under the hood of a gasoline-powered vehicle.\nConsider these common situations that could make someone hesitant to take on a DIY project:\nFor most, these fears boil down to being unsure if a part is right for the job, or if they\u2019re skilled enough to install it.\nTips to Get the Repair Done RightNow, more automotive parts and accessories retailers offer tools to help guide DIYers toward the right inventory for their needs. From brick-and-mortar shops to online marketplaces like eBay Motors, they can enjoy access to more resources to help find the exact part and good value:\nWith the right resources, car projects can feel more manageable. To get started, visit eBayMotors.com to find how-to resources, parts and accessories to tackle some DIY projects, including filters, wiper blades, spark plugs, batteries, light bulbs and more.\nSOURCE:eBay Motors\nShare this:\nRelated\nDiana Gregory Talks to us about Diana Gregory\u2019s Outreach Services\nACE PICKLEBALL CLUB TO DEBUT THEIR HIGHLY ANTICIPATED INDOOR PICKLEBALL FRANCHISES IN THE US, IN EARLY 2023\nThe Absolute Most Comfortable Pickleball Shoe I\u2019ve Ever Worn!\nUnique Experiences at the CitizenM\n2023\u00a0 Nissan Sentra pricing starts at $19,950\n\u201cTHE PEOPLE\u2019S CHOICE AWARDS OF PICKLEBALL\u201d \u2013 VOTING OPEN\nKeeping Pickleball WEIRD, INEXPENSIVE and FUN?
