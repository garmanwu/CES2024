Its unique design allows for multiple placement options: it can stand upright, lay flat, or be mounted on a wall, adapting effortlessly to different room layouts and user preferences.\nBeyond its aesthetic appeal, Renew boasts a 4-stage HEPA-13 filter, effectively removing 99.97% of airborne particles.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than outdoor air. That\u2019s particularly worrying as we spend up to 90% of our times indoors!\nEssential reading: Top fitness trackers and health gadgets\nStudies have shown that poor indoor air quality can lead to a variety of health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and even cognitive impairment. For instance, a Harvard study found that improved air quality leads to a 61% increase in cognitive function test scores. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that reducing particulate matter in the air can lower the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases.\nEco-friendly and user-centric design\nIn line with environmental sustainability, Airthings has made significant strides in reducing plastic use and carbon footprint in their products. The Renew utilizes 50% recycled plastic and features almost entirely recyclable or compostable packaging. Similarly, the Wave Enhance uses 70% less plastic than previous models, significantly reducing its manufacturing carbon footprint.\nAvailability and pricing\nThe Airthings Renew is available for pre-order now at $399 USD, while the Wave Enhance will retail for $149 USD, with availability expected in mid-2024. These devices blend functionality with user-centric design, reflecting a thoughtful approach to air quality improvement. Renew, with its efficient filtration system, and Wave Enhance, with its detailed air quality monitoring, cater to the growing awareness of indoor environmental health.\nLike\u00a0this article?\u00a0Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\u00a0and\u00a0never miss out!\nMarko founded Gadgets & Wearables in 2014, having worked for more than 15 years in the City of London\u2019s financial district.
