        "raw_content": "Inside the control room in Shenzhen\u2019s electricity supplier\nBy Guy Campos\nin APAC, Command and control, Systems June 23, 2021 0\nG&D KVM matrix systems and peripherals have been installed at the Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau whose transmission lines cover a distance as fas as that between Lisbon and Moscow.\nThe urban area of Shenzhen in southern China, which has over 10 million inhabitants, connects Hong Kong with mainland China and is considered to be China\u2018s Silicon Valley for high-tech start-ups.\nShenzhen\u2018s power supply is just as innovative and progressive. All public transportation, for example, is completely electric, and Shenzhen is a pioneer among major Chinese cities in terms of power supply. And yet, compared to European cities, the megapolis has an enormous demand for electricity.\nThe Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau is responsible for the huge task of ensuring that every day more than three million households are supplied with electricity around the clock. With approximately 1,950 square kilometres, the area supplied is around two and a half times larger than the entire city of Berlin. More than 242 substations of 110 kVA are spread over the entire city area, and the cumulative annual power supply by Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau is about 81 TWh.\nThe immense amount of electricity required becomes obvious only by taking a look at the electricity consumption of European metropolises. For example, Berlin has an annual power consumption of about 13.5 TWh, which is about six times less than Shenzhen. Shenzhen\u2018s transmission lines spread across 4,621 km, thus roughly covering the same distance as between Moscow and Lisbon.\nRecently, GuangZhou WeiDian Information Technology Co., Ltd. \u2013 experienced technical integrators when it comes to KVM solutions \u2013 carried out an extensive upgrade of the Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau\u2019s existing KVM architecture. The main focus was to upgrade and modernise conference rooms, several power distribution centres, and a number of control rooms.\nHere, usability played a key role since the workstations were to become much more comfortable and, most importantly, quieter. One of the main challenges was to separate the control room staff from the extremely noisy, technical environment. KVM systems from G&D proved to be the perfect solution for safely and reliably storing the required computer equipment and operating it remotely in real time.\nThe main control room of the Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau has space for about ten employees. They monitor and control the remote computer technology, consisting of more than 500 powerful computers, around the clock. Therefore, all servers were moved to a technical area and connected to about 20 KVM matrix systems from Guntermann & Drunck.\nUsing suitable KVM peripheral modules, the computer signals were extended to and made available at the workstations in the control room. The system architecture was solved using a multi-level top-down cascade so that the connection availability for the servers could be expanded several times over. The key advantage of this solution is that all computer sources are now connected to a G&D matrix switch extending the signals to the consoles. This allows employees to access all required computer technology from any controller station.\nThe Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau control room is operated 24/7. Therefore, it was important to ensure that the new technology would run reliably in continuous operation and facilitate the work of the employees on site. In order to make the work of the controllers as comfortable as possible, the implemented IP-Control-API makes it possible to connect computer sources to projection media and mobile touch panels using a network. Independent of location, each computer can access the desired large screen projection and operator screens.\nThe control room workstations are equipped with several monitors, each of which is integrated into a different computer constellation. To make the dispatchers\u2018 work more pleasant, the Trade Switch function has been integrated. The function combines several console modules to a logical console, which can be operated with one keyboard and one mouse. The keyboard/mouse focus can be changed via hotkey and switched to the desired computer source.\nThe integrated push-get function makes collaborating of employees in the control room easier and more comfortable. It lets employees share the contents of their screens with their co-workers to collaborate on tasks. Users can move the screen contents of a target to \u2013 or get it from \u2013 the display of another console or a big screen.\nThe client also wanted to keep the space occupied by racks relatively small despite the fact that they now needed to access even more servers than before. Therefore, GuangZhou WeiDian Information Technology Co., Ltd. designed a lean but highly flexible KVM infrastructure that also keeps the connections between racks as short as possible. The team completely installed, set up and commissioned the KVM installation.\nSince the system went live, it has been received extremely well by both the operators and the employees involved. \u201cWe have integrated quite a number of G&D matrix systems and peripherals, and so far they have been absolutely reliable during live operation. You can always rely on G&D,\u201c said Stanly Wu, CEO of GuangZhou WeiDian Information Technology Co., Ltd.\nTagged with: china\nYou may also like this\nSign up for regular updates and get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox.

The metal keyboard uses silica gel and elastic pieces as switches. Of course, it can also be made with mechanical switch keys. The biggest feature of the metal keyboard is that because its surface is made of special metal materials and has a solid appearance, it can achieve the effect of anti riot. Therefore, most of it is used in some public places and unattended places, and it can also achieve the functions that ordinary keyboards do not have, such as dust-proof and waterproof. Therefore, input devices with special environmental requirements can use such keyboards, which can be widely used in the fields of financial equipment, communication equipment, military equipment, and a series of self-service terminal devices. There are also many installation methods, including embedded, panel, desktop, and other security methods.\nMost of the metal keyboards on the market are made of 304 stainless steel, which can be used in harsh environmental conditions through solid metal materials and a series of special technical means. The input of this type of keyboard is not as sensitive as a regular keyboard, and the typing speed is relatively slow\nMechanical keyboard:\nMechanical keyboard is a type of keyboard, where each button has a separate switch to control closure. This switch is also known as the \u201caxis\u201d, and there are many types on the market, including green axis, black axis, tea axis, red axis, etc. This is the classification of micro switches, and the touch of the buttons varies. It is precisely because each button is composed of an independent micro movement that the paragraph feeling of the button is strong, resulting in a special feel suitable for gaming and entertainment. This general application is in the gaming industry, or some players who are interested in this aspect and pursue perfection.\n1. The most important aspect of a mechanical keyboard is the shaft, which has a much longer lifespan than ordinary thin film keyboards. A better mechanical keyboard can have a lifespan of over 10 years\n2. After prolonged use of mechanical keyboards, the tactile changes of the keys are minimal\n3. Mechanical keyboards generally have no conflicts with more than 6 keys, and can even have full keys without conflicts. Industrial keyboards generally do not have this requirement\n4. Another biggest feature is that players can change their keycaps themselves, which is very convenient for DIY\nLogin\nUsername or email address\u00a0*\nPassword\u00a0*\nLog in\nRemember me\nLost your password?\nContact us by\nsales@keyu-metalkeyboard.com\nshenzhen keyu since 1995"
