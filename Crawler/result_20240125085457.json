This ultra-thin profile opens up new possibilities for manufacturers catering to consumer demand for higher performance in increasingly thinner devices. TheAirJet Mini Slim is an ideal solution for ultra-thin products like fanless laptops, professional tablets, handheld gaming devices, SSD accessories and smartphones.\nAddressing an industry-wide challenge, the AirJet Mini Slim introduces intelligent self-cleaning feature to conquer dust. Dust accumulation has traditionally posed operational risks and decreased performance in electronic devices. The new AirJet Mini Slim tackles this concern with its self-cleaning function that automatically reverses airflow and clears any accumulated dust from the AirJet dust filters.This ensures sustained peak performance of AirJet over the long term and maintains the high performance of the host device. This intelligent self-cleaning feature is backward compatible and is also available with the AirJet Mini.\nTheAirJet Mini Slim introduces Thermoception, a capability that enables AirJet to independently sense its temperature. This innovation allows the AirJet MiniSlim to optimize its performance autonomously, maximizing heat removal without relying on temperature sensors in the host device, opening new possibilities for cooling devices that lack integrated CPUs and temperature sensing components.\nOurFounder and CEO, Seshu Madhavapeddy, said, \"Reducing the chip's thickness by 0.3mm is a game-changer for products requiring excellent thermal management in increasingly thinner devices. AirJet Mini Slim will bring much-needed performance improvements to ultra-thin electronic devices like fanless laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\"\nSince launching AirJet in January 2023, we have been delighted at the unprecedented demand for our small, highly effective active cooling chips. Our latest product, AirJet Mini Slim with its new intelligent capabilities, is just 2.5mm thick and 8g, 0.3mm thinner and 1g lighter than the original AirJet Mini, while retaining the same tiny footprint, just 27.5mm x 41.5mm. Like all of our products, AirJet Mini Slim is a scalable solution, with additional heat removal achievable by simply adding more AirJet chips. Each chip removes 5W of heat, and the easy integration of multiple chips means two chips can remove 10W, three chips 15W and so on.\nAirJet\u2019s compact size and scalable nature means manufacturers can achieve enhanced heat removal for increased performance in a wide range of faster, thinner, lighter, silent, and dustproof devices. \u00a0AirJet can enhance performance across numerous devices from Notebooks, Mini-PCs, tablets, smartphones and SSDs to the approaching tsunami of IOT devices; DSLR cameras, WiFi access points and LED lighting, and in markets as diverse as the datacenter and automotive industries.\nHeading H2\nHeading H3\nParagraph - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

        "raw_content": "Frore Unveils AirJet Mini Slim: Solid-State Active Cooler Gets Slimmer and Smarter\nFrore Systems has introduced a revamped version of its AirJet Mini solid-state active cooling system at CES 2024. The new AirJet Mini Slim device retained performance of its predecessor (the AirJet Mini), but is slightly thinner, slightly lighter, and smarter too, as it can now clean itself and sense its temperature.\nOn performance side of matters, the AirJet Mini Slim generates 1750 Pascals of back pressure and can dissipate up to 5.25W of heat (at 85\u00b0C die temperature and at 25\u00b0C ambient temperature), which is in line with its predecessor. It also maintains an identical footprint of 27.5 x 41.5 mm as the original solid-state active cooling system.\nOverall, there are two key enhancements in the AirJet Mini Slim compared to its predecessor: its thickness has been reduced to just 2.5mm, coming down from the previous 2.8mm; and it has become lighter, now weighing a mere 8 grams, down from 9 grams.\nAnother significant upgrade of the AirJet Mini Slim is its intelligent self-cleaning system, which reverses the airflow to remove any accumulated dust in the filters to ensure consistent performance of the cooler itself as well as device it is cooling down. Frore says that the capability is backwards compatible with the original AirJet Mini, which probably indicates that it is enabled by firmware or software.\nFinally, the AirJet Mini Slim introduces thermal sensor \u2014 called Thermoception \u2014 that enabled the cooler to independently sense its own temperature and adapt its cooling efficiency as needed. This self-contained function is particularly advantageous for devices that cool down things which do not have their own temperature sensors, such as processors, SSD controllers, and memory chips.\nAll of the refinements of Frore's AirJet Mini Slim serve two purposes: expand the addressable markets for these solid-state active cooling systems and make them more adaptable to needs of customers.\n\"Reducing the chip's thickness by 0.3mm is a game-changer for products requiring excellent thermal management in increasingly thinner devices,\" said Dr. Seshu Madhavapeddy, Founder and CEO of Frore Systems. \"AirJet Mini Slim will bring much-needed performance improvements to ultra-thin electronic devices like fanless laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\"\nWhat remains to be seen is when we are going to see Frore's AirJet Mini Slim in actual devices. While there are numerous companies evaluating the technology, so far there are just a handful of products that have reached the market that use AirJet Minis.\nSource:\nFrore Systems\nPost Your Comment\n15 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 | Frore Systems demonstrates Airjet membrane cooling with Macbook Air, Galaxy Book 2, smartphone and SSDs\nFrore Systems continues to make progress with its Airjet Mini membrane cooling system. At CES, the company showed a whole series of conversions it has carried out itself in operation, once again demonstrating the potential of this unusual cooling method.\nAmong other things, Frore showcased a new Macbook Air 15, a Galaxy Book 2 13\", a smartphone, and two SSDs. In all cases, the continuous performance was increased - in some cases significantly. However, Frore Systems was also open about the disadvantages of the modifications, as the demos are not always intended for productive use but should only demonstrate the possibilities.\nIn the Macbook Air, for example, Frore Systems had to carry out quite large modifications and remove some components. Otherwise, there would be no room for the Airjets in the cramped design. By installing three Airjet Mini, however, the CPU power in continuous operation can be increased from 14 to 20 watts, which translates into around 13 percent more performance in Cinebench.\nIn the Galaxy Book 2, on the other hand, Frore Systems was able to replace the existing fan with three Airjets. The CPU power increases from 14 to 16 watts, and at the same time, the noise development could be reduced from 32 dBA to 25 dBA.\nBattery runtimes are reduced due to improved performance\nHowever, it should be noted in all these demos that a single cooling unit in the form of an Airjet Mini requires around one watt of power consumption. The promised gain in hardware efficiency therefore comes at a high price. In the case of the Macbook and Galaxy Book, cooling costs an extra three watts in the worst case when the system is under load.\nFrore Systems also pointed out that the hardware demonstrated has become more powerful with the Airjet Mini. Of course, this also reduces the battery life under high load. So there are currently also solid reasons against using the Airjet Mini. The current implementation of the technology is only suitable to a limited extent, especially for mobile devices that should not call on maximum performance for battery life.\nThe situation may be different for a gaming smartphone, which Frore Systems also demonstrated. After all, the aim here is to increase performance for gaming. In the age of power banks, battery life is more of a secondary consideration.\nSSDs with significantly increased continuous performance.\nAccording to Frore, it was able to increase the continuous performance of an external Sabrent SSD from around one GByte/s when reading to 3 GByte/s. An additional energy requirement of 2 watts for the two Airjet Mini was sufficient for this. The temperature has also been reduced.\nAccording to Frore, the system is therefore well suited for stationary devices, including external SSDs. The slightly higher power consumption is not a major disadvantage in the context of a wired system. Especially when an SSD can work much faster, for example.\nThis is where the \"race to idle\" effect comes into play. The SSD transfers data particularly quickly and can then switch to sleep mode. Thinner graphics cards are also an interesting area of application, even if powerful graphics accelerators nowadays operate in a watt range that makes it difficult for the approximately 5 watts per Airjet mini. Airjets can be scaled via mass, but the design is complex.\nIncidentally, there are no plans for larger Airjets that could be installed on graphics cards, for example. The company is concentrating on its 5-watt coolers.\n\"Snow Goose\" developer kit for a five-figure sum\nTo make development easier, Frore Systems will also provide a developer kit. However, this will be expensive. Frore Systems spoke of a low five-figure sum that the company will charge. It is therefore easier to buy Zotac's mini PC and take it apart.\nThe kit itself consists of 20 Airjet Minis and several tools. This includes a \"Thermal Test Bed\" to test the performance of a design and five hours of support from Frore Systems.\nThis also shows that the company is focusing more on large customers. Retrofit kits for advanced tinkering are not in sight.\nAirjet Mini Slim gets thinner\nFrore Systems is also currently preparing the next step. The next generation Airjet Mini Slim is to be launched soon. The performance data is identical to its predecessor, but the space requirement has been reduced slightly. The installation height has been reduced from 2.8 mm to just 2.5 mm. For both generations, however, a 0.4 mm buffer must be included for the air movement.\nAn Airjet solution, therefore, now fits into a space budget of 2.9 mm. That is slightly less than four credit cards stacked on top of each other (without embossing). It would, therefore, be more likely to be used in a smartphone, even if it would still take up a lot of space.\nThe progress and examples that Frore Systems can now show are certainly promising. However, it is not yet known if and when other products will appear alongside Zotac's mini computer. Frore Systems used the CES 2024 - like Computex last year - to convince potential hardware manufacturers of the concept.\nSource(s)\nFrore Systems / CES\nRelated Articles"
