        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nRoborock unveils its newest fleet of robot vacuums at CES\nYear after year, Roborock has impressed me with the robot vacuums and mops that it creates. The company consistently delivers on cleaning efficiency and reliability, and I'm always left satisfied. At CES 2024, the robot vacuum manufacturer unveiled its latest fleet of cleaning machines.\nAlso: CES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nS8 Max Series\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra look to take their cleaning performance to the next level by adding a FlexiArm Design, meant to get deep into corners and edges where a lot of hidden dirt and debris lives. Once the robot is finished cleaning, it travels back to its RockDock clean base where the robot will automatically empty its dust bin, dispense and refill the cleaning detergent, wash the mop head with hot water, and then dry the mop head with warm air.\nPrevious S8 Max models truly felt hands-free during my testing periods. The only manual intervention required was to add water to the clean tank and empty the dirty water tank as needed. That requirement is eliminated now. The S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra now offer a new refill and drainage dock variant, enabling the robot to be connected directly to home drainage systems. This will allow the robot to work completely on its own, relieving you of any and all manual intervention.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra will cost $1799.99 and the S8 Max Ultra $1599.99; both will be available on Amazon and the Roborock Webstore starting in April 2024.\nQ Revo Series\nThe Roborock Q Revo Series will see upgrades in 2024. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same quality, efficient clean for a lower price. The two will also include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all of your home's dirt and debris. The Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of the majority of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock said will sanitize your floors.\nAlso: The best robot vacuums of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\nThe Roborock Q Revo MaxV will be priced at $1199.99 and the Q Revo Pro will cost $999.99. Both robots will be available on Amazon and the Roborock Webstore starting April 2024.\nRelated\nThe best robot vacuums, mops, and mowers from CES 2024\nThe 15 best robots and AI tech we saw at CES 2024\nThe 35+ best Amazon deals right now: TVs, robot vacuums, and more"

        "raw_content": "Roborock shows off highly automated robot vacuums at CES 2024\nRoborock is responsible for many of the best robot vacuums, and this year is shaping up to be another big one for the company. A whole fleet of robot vacuums were on display at CES 2024, including the highly automated S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra \u2014 both of which can connect to your home drainage system to automatically empty and refill their water reservoirs.\nThe Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is the most luxurious of the bunch, offering a self-maintained cleaning system that will empty water tanks, refill water tanks, dispense detergent, wash its mop with hot water, and dry its mop with warm air. All this is possible due to its newfound ability to connect to your home\u2019s built-in drain lines, removing the need for you to fuss around with dirty water tanks or refill water reservoirs (which is arguably the worst part of owning a robot vacuum).\nAs for vacuuming prowess, it\u2019s sitting near the top of its class with an impressive 10,000 Pa of suction. The S8 Max Ultra, meanwhile, tops out at 8,000 Pa. Both have also seen upgrades to their side brushes, which now sit on swinging arms that can extend outward to reach crevices often missed by standard robot vacuums.\nBeyond those enhancements, the S8 Max Series carries over many of the features that made the S8 Pro Ultra so popular, including the robust Roborock smartphone app, impressive obstacle navigation skills, and the ability to detect dirt and adjust suction levels as needed.\nRoborock\u2019s Q Revo Series is designed to be more affordable than the S8 Max Series, though it offers many of the same perks. This includes hot water mop washing, warm air drying, and the ability to empty its dustbin. It also boasts an impressive 7,000Pa of suction, which is 1,000Pa more than last year\u2019s highly reviewed S8 Pro Ultra.\nRounding out the Roborock CES 2024 announcements is the Flexi Series, which is a roller vacuum that can handle both wet and dry messes. It\u2019s not going to automatically clean your home, but its docking station does incorporate the new warm water mop cleaning and air drying seen on the S8 Max Series.\nThe Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra costs $1,800 and goes on sale in April. The S8 Max Ultra also launches in April, but is a bit cheaper at $1,600. The Q Revo Series launches in April \u2014 the Revo MaxV is $1,200 and the Revo Pro is $1,000.\nPricing and launch details are yet to be determined for the Flexi Pro and Flexi.\nSamsung SmartThings -- an application designed to connect and control your smart home devices -- doesn't quite get the same attention as platforms like Google Home or Apple HomeKit. However, it made some big announcements at CES 2024, and it's shaping up to be a big year for Samsung's first-party platform. Along with enhanced support for TVs and new uses for QR codes, SmartThings is rolling out a brilliant Map View feature, which creates a digital map of your home and shows you exactly where all your connected devices are located.\nHere's how it works. Instead of scrolling through a list of all your devices or jumping between groups in your smartphone app, Map View lets you see a 3D representation of your home on your smartphone. Inside this map, you'll find icons for all your smart home gadgets corresponding to their actual physical location. That means you can quickly find exactly which device you want to control without needing to scroll through a long list.\nSamsung unleashed a flurry of announcements at CES 2024, including several upcoming smart home appliances powered by AI. The lineup features an induction cooktop, washer and dryer combo, slide-in range, and refrigerator, all of which use new A.I. features to streamline your daily chores.\nThe Samsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator was among the first reveals, debuting ahead of CES 2024. Featuring the premium AI Family Hub+ and AI Vision Inside, the futuristic fridge can scan and identify 33 different types of food items and send you alerts before they expire.\nLockly makes some of the most intriguing smart locks on the market -- including the premium Vision Elite and minimalist Flex Touch Pro -- and now the company is gearing up to bring Matter and facial recognition to its lineup. Several new devices were revealed at CES 2024, including a Matter hub that's backward compatible with most existing Lockly products.\nThe Matter Link Hub is Lockly's first attempt at bringing the interoperability standard to its roster. By syncing your smart lock to the hub, you'll be able to integrate it with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and (for the first time) the Apple Home app. Best of all, you won't need to sacrifice any countertop space for the Matter Link Hub, as it connects directly to an electrical outlet and should take no more than a few minutes to install.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

And the S8 is advertised to have more features than any of them.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\nAbout the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nFirst and foremost, the S8 is a floor cleaner. To help provide edge-to-edge cleaning, this robot boasts FlexiArm, a pneumatic arm that allows the mop pad and brushes to extend beyond the chassis. That means the S8 can clean in tight spaces, like around furniture legs or under toe kicks, where it normally would not fit.\nNot only will the S8 be able to clean hardwood and carpets better, but it can even clean itself. The docking station boasts the ability to empty the robot\u2019s dustbin, clean its mop pads with hot water, and even clean its own interior.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra has a dock that can clean itself.\nThe robot itself will also be more adaptive than previous iterations. The S8 has a forward-facing camera with which to recognize objects and stains so it can avoid and clean appropriately. You can also stream what the camera sees directly to your phone, transforming the S8 into a mobile security camera.\nOverall, we have positive feelings about what Roborock wants to do with the Q Revo Series. When we tested the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra and Dyad Pro, we saw a brand that was a very strong second adopter.\nAll the features listed above can be found on models from other companies. However, nowhere can you find them all bundled together.\nThe Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be available in April 2024, and we can\u2019t wait to try it out on our robot vacuum obstacle course.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.

        "raw_content": "Roborock Showcases Its Cutting-Edge Cleaning Solutions At CES 2024\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThis content was paid for by Roborock and written by SlashGear.\nAttendees of this year's CES in Las Vegas were the first to see a new line of six state-of-the-art cleaning solutions unveiled by Roborock: the S8 MaxV Ultra, S8 Max Ultra, Q Revo MaxV, Q Revo Pro, Flexi Pro, and Flexi Lite. The company \u2014 a global leader in ultra-intelligent home robotics specifically engineered to simplify daily life \u2014 designed the impressive new line of vacuums and mops by focusing on the evolving needs of 21st-century consumers, who have increasingly relied on modern technology to help complete previously mundane tasks, like cleaning.\nRoborock developed the new line of innovative products in response to a growing demand for \"products that clean well but are also easy, smart to interact with, and can seamlessly integrate into their smart home,\" according to Richard Chang, Roborock's founder and CEO. \"We now offer more connectivity options than ever before \u2014 which we found are one of the most sought-after features for customers \u2014 while our robots now integrate robotic arm mechanics to clean better and are unique to the market.\"\nFounded ten years ago, Roborock has become an influential smart home brand across the globe by launching several advanced products aimed at making the lives of its customers more convenient. This year's CES, where companies both large and small came from around the world to showcase groundbreaking technology, was an appropriate venue for Roborock to debut its latest ultramodern cleaning devices \u2014 including its most technologically advanced one-stop cleaning solution to date: the S8MaxV Ultra.\nA robotic arm allows the S8MaxV Ultra to clean nearly everywhere\nBuilt to handle \"cleaning beyond limits,\" the Roborock S8 Max Series is a leap in hands-free convenience, applying industry-leading suction power and mopping capability and deep corner and edge cleaning tech that can achieve visible cleanliness in invisible areas. The S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra robot vacuum and mop accomplish this in part by employing a unique robotic arm that enables complete corner and edge cleaning capabilities. The cutting-edge proprietary FlexiArm Design Side Brush is powered by this robotic arm and a 185 rpm rotating Extra Edge Spinning Mop System that works with it to clean hard-to-reach spaces with 100 percent corner coverage.\nCombined with intelligent mop re-washing/re-mopping capabilities and a base station \u2014 the RockDock Ultra \u2014 that can maintain a robot cleaner with heated air and hot water, these innovations make the S8 Max Series Roborock's most technologically advanced one-stop cleaning solution to date. Its VibraRise 3.0 Mopping System redefines mopping excellence with two vibration modules \u2014 20 mm Mop Module Lifting and 4,000 times/min high-speed sonic mopping. Roborock also offers industry-leading suction power with this line of robot cleaners \u2014 the S8 MaxV Ultra is capable of up to 10,000 Pa suction power, while the S8 Max Ultra can achieve 8,000 Pa. With this kind of power, dirt and dust will vanish instantly without a trace \u2014 even on carpets, thanks to Roborock's Carpet Boost+ System, which has a 30 percent higher hair pick rate than previous models. Its DuoRoller Riser Brush can achieve impressive vacuuming efficiency across all the different floor types in your home with fewer hair tangles and other hassles.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra are easy to maintain and control\nThe 8-in-1 RockDock Ultra base station does most of the work of maintaining your robot cleaner, so you don't have to. Using 60 degrees Celsius hot water and air it can wash and dry the mop after each cleaning to prevent odor and mildew build-up. Plus, it can connect to your home drainage system and automatically refill and empty the robot cleaner when needed, as well as automatically dispense detergent, allowing your robot cleaner to keep going without you needing to step in and manually empty or refill the RockDock Ultra's water tanks.\nTech enthusiasts will also appreciate the cutting-edge intelligence and smart home controls built into the S8 MaxV Ultra. Equipped with PreciSense LiDAR, the robot cleaner can scan and create detailed maps of your home to determine the most efficient cleaning route. At the same time, its Reactive AI 2.0 Obstacle Recognition uses an RGB camera and 3D structure light to identify and avoid obstacles in its path, including shoes, pet waste, and even mirrors. Additionally, Roborock's DirTect system can recognize dirt levels and different types of messes, change cleaning settings, and conduct re-mopping accordingly.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is also a cinch to control, equipped with a \"Hello Rocky\" voice assistant that allows you to start and pause cleaning, specify which rooms you'd like to cover, adjust cleaning modes, and more \u2014 hands-free with just the sound of your voice. It can even do this without a Wi-Fi connection. The robot cleaner also features Matter support and video calling, perfect for those seeking the most advanced cleaning solution.\nThe S8 Max Ultra is priced at $1,599.99, while the S8 MaxV Ultra is $1,799. Both will be available from Amazon and the Roborock Webstore in April 2024.\nThe Q Revo Series also debuted at CES 2024\nAlso launching at CES 2024 were Roborock's new Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro robot cleaners, which have extendable dual-spinning mops and offer flagship-level cleaning, self-maintenance, and intelligent features. While not quite as powerful as the S8 Max Series, the Q Revo Series can still eliminate messes with a formidable mop system capable of 7,000 Pa suction power and 200 rpm. It also includes a robotic arm mop and the FlexiArm Design Edge Mopping System to clean hard-to-reach areas as close as 1.85 mm along edges, giving you 98.8% edge coverage.\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 of the Q Revo Series also offers full suite self-maintenance with 60 degrees Celsius hot water mop washing and 45 degrees Celsius warm air drying, water tank refilling, and automatic dust emptying. Other features the Q Revo series can include are voice control with the \"Hello Rocky\" smart assistant, the ability to detect dirt levels and determine subsequent mop re-washing and conduct re-mopping when necessary, and the ability to detect carpets and lift its mop 10 mm to avoid dampening them.\nThe Q Revo MaxV is priced at $1,199.99, while the Q Revo Pro is $999.99, and both will be available from Amazon and the Roborock Webstore in April 2024.\nThe Roborock Flexi Series is for those who still prefer handheld cleaning devices\nRoborock also introduced the Flexi Series to the U.S. market at CES 2024, showcasing two lightweight and flexible solutions for simultaneous vacuuming and mopping \u2014 the Flexi Pro and Flexi Lite. Designed to tackle wet and dry messes in a single sweep, the Flexi series delivers exceptional cleaning performance edge-to-edge in even the most difficult household areas with its 17,000 Pa suction power.\nWhile not a robot vacuum, the Flexi Series is still packed with cutting-edge technology and advanced features, including DirTect smart sensors that adjust cleaning and self-cleaning levels depending on the amount of dirt detected, and the Roborock RevoBrush 2.0 with Roborock's signature Self-Drying & Cleaning System for wet-dry vacuums, which now includes warm water cleaning and warm air drying.\nThe Flexi Series also lives up to its name by employing FlatReach technology that enables it to lay completely flat to clean under low furniture and clean edges and corners with margins of less than a single millimeter. The Flexi Pro is equipped with SlideTech automated adaptive wheels for lighter push-pull motion, a headlight, dual-edge cleaning, app compatibility, voice alerts, and more. The Flexi Series's launch date and retail prices haven't been released yet but will be announced soon.\nRoborock designs cleaning devices to solve genuine problems\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra, S8 Max Ultra, Q Revo MaxV, Q Revo Pro, Flexi Pro, and Flexi Lite all benefit from what Roborock has learned by researching, developing, and producing home cleaning devices \u2014 particularly robotic, cordless, and wet/dry vacuum cleaners \u2014 over the past decade. Committed to bringing the cleaning product industry into the 21st century, Roborock designs its products with an eye on solving genuine problems, using \"innovation for better living\" as a guiding principle.\nSince its founding in 2014, the company has won over consumers with innovative devices like the Q5 Pro and Q8 Max, and its cleaning solutions are currently available in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Germany, France, and Spain. The S8MaxV Ultra and Roborock's other latest products will win over even more satisfied customers as they leave the tradeshow floor of CES and start cleaning homes worldwide. In April 2024, you can purchase Roborock's S8MaxV Ultra and its other robot cleaners from Amazon and the Roborock Webstore."

        "raw_content": "The best robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 go where Roombas still haven't\nThe robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 are ushering in a new era of automated at-home cleaning. And none of them are Roombas.\nLike Apple, iRobot doesn't do CES. Rather, the latest Roombas arrived in September 2023 and had a peaceful few months of (basically) being the best in the business. That's changing with the 2024 fleet of new flagship models from brands like Roborock, Samsung, Ecovacs, and Eufy, all of which showcased serious upgrades to their previous robot vacuums.\nWe're seeing a few recurring glow-ups that are setting new standards for ways a robot vacuum can make your life easier: Small obstacle avoidance (think phone chargers, socks, and pet waste) is non-negotiable at this point, but fully self-sufficient mopping \u2014 real elbow grease, AI-fueled stain detection, and automated washing and drying of mopping pads \u2014\u00a0is the clear theme of the year. Even the most advanced Roomba doesn't offer those last two bullet points.\nBelow, we're diving into the details of our favorite 2024 competitors, as well as hashing out the differences between the new models and their predecessors. We'll also give pricing and release date information if we have it.\nRoborock S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra\nIt feels like just yesterday (was October not last month?) that Roborock dropped its last bots of 2023, the Q5 Pro and Q8 Max series. However, Roborock operates on both its release schedule and the CES schedule, and there are yet again new Roborocks.\nThe more premium vacs of the two new series are the S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra. This series' main claim to fame is a bendy robotic arm that extends from the underside of the vacuum to detail spots that a side brush would miss \u2014\u00a0a longstanding blind spot of even the most powerful robot vacuums.\nA front-facing camera is also on board, which guides more meticulous small obstacle and stain detection and can livestream footage as it roves \u2014 technically giving you the ability to talk to someone who's at home by talking through the app.\nSmarts aside, we'd be remiss not to mention the enhanced suction power on these bad boys: the Max Ultra clocks 8,000 Pa while the S8 MaxV Ultra clocks a whopping 10,000 Pa \u2014\u00a0doubling the power of so many vacs on the current market that were previously thought to be pretty damn powerful.\nLike the S8 Pro Ultra, which was unveiled at last year's CES, the S8 Max Ultra and MaxV Ultra docks wash mop heads and dry them with warm air, then refill the water tank in the bot itself. If you'd prefer to also not be responsible for manually refilling the larger water tank in the dock itself, there is a version of both new S8s that can be hooked up directly to your home's drainage system.\nStarting in April 2024, the Roborock S8 Max Ultra will be available for $1,599.99 and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be available for $1,799.99.\nRoborock Q Revo Pro and Q Revo MaxV\nThe more affordable new series is the Q Revo line, with both the Revo Pro and Revo MaxV sticking close to the $1,000 price point. (The latter is more expensive due to the presence of a built-in voice assistant.)\nAside from aesthetic differences of the docks, the main difference from the S8 line is the Q Revo's focus on more detailed mopping than sheer suction power. It mops with two oscillating mopping pads spinning at 200 RPM (rather than the S8's singular pad) for a closer clean around obstacles like table legs.\nCompared to the S8 series, the new Revo models clean with 7,000 Pa of suction instead of 10,000 \u2014\u00a0still impressive \u2014\u00a0and are equipped with the same FlexiArm design to reach into corners. They also wash and dry the mopping pads.\nThe Q Revo Pro will go for $999.99 and the Q Revo MaxV will go for $1,199.99 when they become available for purchase in April 2024.\nEcovacs X2 Combo\nSpeaking of corner cleaning, Ecovacs is once again taking the literal route with another square robot vacuum \u2014\u00a0its second released in three months. After the Sept. 2023 drop of the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (a welcomed upgrade over the frustrating Deebot X1 Omni) Ecovacs has already found a unique way to build on its most advanced robot vacuum: adding a handheld vacuum to the ensemble.\nYes, \"Combo\" refers to a new docking station that charges the robot vacuum itself on one side and a cordless handheld vacuum on the other side \u2014\u00a0because we all know that there are some intricate messes that you'd prefer to tackle by hand. Both vacuums self-empty into the bi-directional dustbin in the middle.\nOther features seen in the X2 Omni that have carried over to the X2 Combo include mopping, washing and drying of the mopping pads, automatic water tank refilling, AI obstacle avoidance, and a voice assistant called Yiko that you can use to beckon the vacuum to wherever you're standing. Unlike the X2 Omni, the Combo is also Matter-ready, meaning it's compatible with several smart home systems.\nThe Ecovacs X2 Combo will cost $1,599 upon release, which is TBA but likely in the spring.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+\nSamsung's booth theme for CES 2024 \u2014 and the bigger theme for CES as a whole this year, apparently \u2014\u00a0is AI. More tangibly, Samsung's lean into AI is showcased in its new robot vacuum, the Bespoke Jet Combo AI+. Though it isn't Samsung's first robot vacuum with \"AI\" in the name, it does use AI in a major new way. On top of AI-powered smart mapping and AI-powered small obstacle detection, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ can also detect stains on hard floors without you having to designate a cleaning zone in the app.\nSo yes, Samsung's flagship robot vacuum finally mops. Once the Jet Bot finds a stain, the bot quickly returns to the dock to heat the mopping pads with hot enough water to create steam, then heads back to the problem spot to scrub, spinning at 170 RPM.\nIn line with the trend of fully automated mopping that we've been seeing, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ charges on a self-emptying dock that also auto-fills the Jet Bot's water tank and washes and dries the mop.\nPricing and a release date for the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ are still up in the air. Its predecessor, the Jet Bot AI+ that does not mop, debuted at $1,299.99 in 2021, so we expect the Combo AI+ to be slightly more expensive than that upon release.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nEufy's latest botvac doesn't necessarily do anything that we haven't seen before. It empties itself, mops with some elbow grease, washes and dries its mopping pads, and avoids obstacles like cords and socks. It's a solid checklist that's almost expected at this point in the game.\nWhat is groundbreaking about the X10 Pro Omni, though, is the fact that it secures all of those features for half the cost of multiple other vacuums in this list.\nWhile Ecovacs takes a break from using \"Omni\" in its robot vacuum names, Eufy's Omni era will undoubtedly change the game for the sub-$1,000 robot vacuum category. Despite debuting at a price point that's $100 less than its predecessor, the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni dishes out significantly stronger suction power (8,000 Pa versus the X9 Pro's 5,500 Pa) and cleans with a new edge-hugging feature for better baseboard and corner attention. It's also square-ish with rounded edges.\nLike the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni mops with dual spinning, pressurized mops that are fully lifted above carpeting and rugs when it's sensed. After mopping, the self-empty dock also washes and dries the mopping pads.\nThis packed checklist should cost way more than the mere $799.99 price that Eufy's asking, but we're not complaining. You can secure the X10 Pro Omni for yourself starting on Feb. 20.\nTopics\nCES\nRobot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers essential home tech like vacuums and TVs as well as sustainable swaps and travel.
