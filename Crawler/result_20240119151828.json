        "raw_content": "Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering\nOrganisation profile\nOrganisation profile\nIndustrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) is a professional discipline that focuses on developing and implementing optimal solutions from a system-level perspective.\nThis involves people, technology, quality, finance, information, and environmental issues. The main role of an Industrial Systems Engineer is to organize and work harmoniously with others to streamline operational procedures, improve productivity and enhance overall system performance. The ultimate goal is to increase efficiency, reduce operating costs, and increase customer satisfaction.\nISE is different from other conventional engineering disciplines whereby knowledge and skills are applied to specific areas. For example, traditionally, manufacturing engineers usually work in a production environment. In contrast, ISE provides the skillsets which will enable practitioners to work in a variety of organizations across both the industrial and commercial sectors. Industrial and Systems Engineers have a much more flexible career path, as ISE graduates are widely employed in areas that include new product development, transportation, theme parks, logistic services, banks, public utilities, business development, consultancy enterprises, government departments, etc. The ultimate objective of the ISE discipline is to provide leadership in the design of integrated industrial and commercial systems for the advancement and well-being of society.\nThe Department is motivated by the world-wide industrial restructuring that is occurring as a result of rapid advances in technology, communication, and information technology. According to the Chief Executive's 2018 Policy Address, the government has committed to expedite re-industrialisation, encourage smart manufacturing and support the engagement of local enterprises in advanced technologies, especially those related to Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the Department is offering professional academic programmes to meet these needs. Come join us, and when you graduate you can have a rewarding career and make a strong contribution to a better world.\nIn conclusion, we are committed not only to providing high quality education, but also to advancing academic and applied research. We strive to maintain our position as a leading department in this field in the region, through innovative practices in teaching and learning, applied research, and the promotion of knowledge transfer.\nUN Sustainable Development Goals\nIn 2015, UN member states agreed to 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.

This removes physical distance and information barriers, expanding social boundaries and enhancing relationship security.\n\"This advertising campaign for the app utilises various touch points. Posters are designed to highlight the app's instant location sharing, making friendships visible at any moment.\n\"Social media pages are created to introduce the social app to local residents, sharing app information through a unique perspective. Viral online videos are produced to creatively demonstrate how the app easily locates friends, portraying a transparent city.\n\"Lastly, a citywide hide-and-seek competition is proposed to generate brand awareness.

What if the talkative and socially experienced taxi driver becomes a listener and mentor, the banal taxi trip a caring and supportive service?\n\"The project team identifies taxis throughout the city, along with their experienced drivers, as a valuable community resource, and explores whether the taxi service could extend beyond physical transportation and include emotional support.\n\"The team designs an innovative service through which passengers in emotional need can request a cruising, caring and breathing space, and have a casual, cheerful and meaningful conversation with a range of drivers of different backgrounds.\n\"The team also explores creative ways to prototype the service experience with taxi drivers and potential service users.\"\nStudents: Chiu Tsz Ching Crystal, Fu Hing Wan Nicole and Yu Hin WaCourse: BA (Hons) in Social DesignTutors: Cheung Michael Chan, Kam Fai Chan, Sandy Ng and Jonathan Yu\nCommunity Dot Dot Dot by Ho Ka Chung, Simon Lam, Lau Ho Yin Oscar, Tang Chung Yin Sam and Wong Kin Hin Eric\n\"This project collaborates with Tsing Lam Alliance Church in Tsing Yi's St. Paul Village.

Hong Kong has been in an even trickier position than other cities, given its highly outward-facing economy and connectivity with China, meaning it was naturally impacted by the sentiment of global investment around China turning so sharply after the huge bull runs in the country for the past 20-plus years. While the fundamentals of Hong Kong have shaken and shifted, 2023 was a year where much of the foundational work of building an innovation scene was done.\nHere are my two cents on what to expect in Hong Kong for 2024 in the early-stage startup scene, organized by opportunities and challenges:\nOpportunities\n1. RAISe+ Scheme \u2013 first batch of innovative university startups to be unveiled\nA HK government-led program with an allocation of HKD 10 billion, the RAISe+ scheme will, on a matching basis, fund 100 high-potential research teams in eight universities. Each team can get up to HKD 100 million in non-dilutive funding. This is the biggest funding scheme available for university-originated startups in HK. The scheme was a core focus for many knowledge transfer offices in HK universities in 2023, where professors and their fellow researchers/project leads were busy writing proposals, while university staff jiggled with all the letters of intent from investors/industry partners and requirements set forth by the Innovation and Technology Commission. The first batch of recipients is expected to be announced within Q1 2024 after screening.\nWe met some of these projects with interesting underlying IPs. How the universities, professors, project leads, and investors handle the rest of the difficult parts of starting a venture \u2013 hiring, fundraising, productization, fundraising, and more \u2013 is the next set of questions to be answered.\n2. HK remains the go-to hub for Greater Bay Area (GBA) startups going global\nWe spent quite some time in 2023 meeting China-based early-stage startups related to advanced manufacturing (semiconductors, new materials, ESG materials), industry 4.0 (robotics, automation, innovations in traditional industries), and cross-border e-commerce. Chinese founders shared their firsthand experience facing the lowered spending power of local corporates and consumers. As a result, many of them have taken their products abroad, selling at a higher price point than what they could ask for in China. Over time, China has built up top-of-class manufacturing and operating know-how and trained skilled labor that is irreplaceable by other geographies.\nChina startups that possess unique R&D and manufacturing know-how and operate in non-sensitive industries will still utilize Hong Kong as the hub for initial funding and landing their first batch of overseas customers.\n3. Lots of dry powder waiting to deploy in HK\nIn 2023, local and global GPs secured fresh funding to be deployed specifically to companies with a Hong Kong nexus, thanks to the setup of the Hong Kong Growth Portfolio. Last year, many of them were setting up their teams and understanding the ecosystem in HK. On the other side, CVCs and universities are increasingly active in either direct investment or fund investment in HK as well. There is pressure to deploy for these investors, which should help to drive more deal activity in 2024.\nHaving said all this, the HK startup ecosystem is faced with the following fundamental challenges.\nChallenges\n1. Opex \u2013 cost of operating, and funding gap between Seed to Series B\nWhile GPs are loaded with cash, there is a lack of startups with a valuation range of $200 million \u2013 $500 million that can digest a round of $20 million \u2013 $100 million in HK. On the other side, there has been a funding gap that remains unfilled for startups looking for Series A/+ lead investors.\nRent and labor costs continue to be the two biggest headaches for HK-based startups.\n2. Talent \u2014 lack of startup operators, and operator-turned-founders\nWhile there has been strong growth in the number of startups in HK over the past decade, the ecosystem of operators who are willing to take the risk and be the first 10 employees of a fresh HK startup is still nascent. We are still building the flywheel where early employees of successful startups become founders or operators for another early-stage venture. Not to mention the challenge of the tech brain drain in the city since 2020.\n3. Exit pathway \u2013 billion-dollar question for both VC and startups\nWith many corporates cutting their spending, the incentive for larger players to acquire startups has decreased, especially when M&A activity is already low in the region. Coupled with a stagnant IPO market, HK startups are faced with an even tougher market compared to other comparable startups in other regions.\nSupport TechNode\nWith a small team, TechNode provides timely news and thoughtfully researched articles for worldwide readers interested in learning more about the Chinese tech industry.\nYour contribution is appreciated.\nRelated\nLatest stories\nPopular articles\nSections\nAbout\nTechNode Group\nEditions\n\u6caaICP\u590714046707\u53f7-4\nSign In\nWe've recently sent you an authentication link.

        "raw_content": "Contents\nHong Kong Polytechnic University\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)[note 1] is a public research university in Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The university is one of the eight government-funded degree-granting tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. Founded in 1937 as the first Government Trade School, it is the first institution to provide technical education in Hong Kong. In 1994, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed a bill which granted the former Hong Kong Polytechnic official university status.[9]\nPolyU consists of 8 faculties and schools, offering programmes covering applied science, business, construction, environment, engineering, social science, health, humanities, design, hotel and tourism management. The university offers over 160 taught programmes for more than 25,800 students every year.[10]\nHistory[edit]\nGovernment Trade School (1937\u20131947)[edit]\nIn 1937, the Government Trade School was founded at Wood Road, Wan Chai. The school was the first publicly funded, post-secondary technical institution in Hong Kong.[11] Under George White, the then principal, it ran classes in marine wireless operating, mechanical engineering and building construction.[12] The campus was a three-storey high Victorian architecture, and commonly referred to the \u201cRed Brick House\u201d by the locals.[13]\nHong Kong Technical College (1947\u20131972)[edit]\nAfter World War II, the Government Trade School became the Hong Kong Technical College in 1947, offering both full-time and part-time courses. In 1957, the new campus of the college located in Hung Hom was constructed. It was opened by Sir Alexander Grantham, the then Governor of Hong Kong.[12]\nHong Kong Polytechnic (1972\u20131994)[edit]\nIn 1965, Sir Chung Sze-yuen (S.Y. Chung) suggested establishing a polytechnic in Hong Kong to provide post-secondary technical education. Dr Tang Ping-yuen was appointed by the government as the chair of the Polytechnic Planning Committee in May 1969.[14] On 24 March 1972, the Legislative Council passed the Hong Kong Polytechnic Ordinance and the institute was established. Sir Chung assumed the first chair of the Polytechnic Board of Directors (later renamed Polytechnic Council in 1978). The Polytechnic's mandate was to provide professional-oriented education to meet the need for qualified workers. The institution launched its first five degree programmes in 1983, and introduced its first MPhil and PhD programmes in 1986 and 1989 respectively.[12]\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (1994\u2013Present)[edit]\nIn 1994, the university gained approval from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee (UPGC; now UGC) for self-accreditation of degree programmes, without the restrictions from the Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance .[15] With that, the Institution assumed full university status on 25 November 1994, changing its name to \u201cThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University\u201d.[12]\nCampuses[edit]\nMain campus[edit]\nPolyU's main campus, in Hung Hom, Kowloon,[16] was designed by a team led by James Kinoshita from P&T Group in 1972.[17] It has over 20 buildings with red-brick walls, many of which are inter-connected and raised one floor above the podium, creating sheltered open-air spaces for multi-purposes such as logistics and parking.[18] Apart from buildings named after donors, the rotundas which connects the buildings are identified in English letters (from cores and blocks A to Z, without K, O and I). It is one of the largest and densest educational campus in the world.[19]\nBlock Z is the eighth phase of the campus expansion project. It is situated across the northwestern side of the main campus, separated by Chatham Road. It can be accessed through a pedestrian tunnel or a 80-meter-long footbridge, which was proposed in 2016 and built in 2019.[20]\nIn addition to classrooms, laboratories and other academic facilities, the university provides a multi-purpose auditorium, recreational and catering facilities, medical facilities, as well as a bookstore and banks. The Jockey Club Auditorium began operation in 2000, its balcony and main floor seating accommodate up to 1,084 persons. It is specially designed as a multi-purpose venue for the hosting of conferences, seminars, ceremonies, corporate meetings, as well as the increasing number of cultural activities and performances, operas, chamber music, dramas, dances, film shows, variety shows, mini concerts etc.[21]\nThere are multiple sports facilities, including two swimming pools (Block X and Michael Clinton Swimming Pool), 2 indoor sports grounds (Shaw Sports Complex and Kwong On Jubilee Sports Centre), an outdoor sports ground (Keith Legg Sports Field) with basketball and soccer fields and jogging track, 2 outdoor tennis courts, and a joint-sports centre.\nThe PolyU Library was established on 1 August 1972.[22] Two centres operated in Hung Hom and Quarry Bay until 1976, when they eventually merged into the present building. It was named after shipping entrepreneur and philanthropist Yue-Kong Pao in 1995.\nIn 2014, there were over 2.77\u00a0million of library holdings in total, with nearly 600,000 electronic resources. The six-storey library provides 3,900 study spaces and is equipped with a 24-hour study centre and audio-visual information areas. In 2017, the 3/F and 4/F of the library was transformed into the \"i-space\" which contains services such as VR Experience Zone, Internet of Things (IoT), Laser Cutting / Engraving, 3D Scanning, Book Scanning, Large Format Printing, Vinyl Cutting and 3D Printing. Video production facilities such as the One button studio and Digital Studio are also available on the 3/F.\nThe Innovation Tower, designed by Zaha Hadid, is located on the northwestern side of the university's main campus. This 15-story building provides 15,000 square meters of net floor area. It houses facilities for the School of Design, including exhibition areas, multi-functional classrooms and lecture theatres, design studios and workshops, as well as a communal lounge. The School of Design has been ranked among the best design schools worldwide.[23]\nTeaching and research hotel[edit]\nThe Hotel Icon was officially opened on 21 September 2011. The hotel is wholly owned by the university as a teaching and research hotel of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM). SHTM has consistently been ranked among the top hotel and tourism management schools in the world.\nHung Hom Bay and West Kowloon Campus[edit]\nThe Hung Hom Bay Campus and West Kowloon Campus are the two satellite campuses which house the College of Professional and Continuing Education which is formed by two subsidiaries: the Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) and School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED).\nEstablished in 2001 under the auspices of PolyU, HKCC is a self-financed post-secondary institution which offers associate degree and higher diploma programmes spanning the domains of arts, science, social sciences, business, health care and design for senior secondary school leavers. HKCC classes are conducted at the Hung Hom Bay and West Kowloon.[24]\nAcademics[edit]\nOrganisation[edit]\nAs of 2020, the university had 915 sub-degree students, 14,961 undergraduate students, and 10,369 postgraduate students.\nOver 150 programmes (including Higher diploma, Bachelor's degrees with honours, and postgraduate programmes) are offered through 8 faculties and schools, including Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles, Faculty of Business, Faculty of Construction and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Faculty of Humanities, School of Design, and School of Hotel and Tourism Management.[25]\nPolyU Graduate School, established in September 2020, oversees the administration of research postgraduate education of the university, though the academic supervision of students is still managed by the respective faculties, schools or department.[26]\nThe College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPEC), founded in 2002, is a subsidiary of the university. As of 2019, the college had 13,032 students. It is formed by Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) and School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED), both of which offer self-financed degree programmes and sub-degrees programmes in the name of the college.[27]\nNotable academics[edit]\nAs of 2020, PolyU employed 1,182 academic faculty members and 1,504 research staff, with additional staff at the CPEC. The faculty includes scholars such as Swedish systemic functional linguist C.M.I.M. Matthiessen, electrical and electronic engineer Philip Chan, mechanical engineer Timothy W. Tong. Some politicians in Hong Kong serve as faculty in PolyU, including current or former member of the Legislative Council Fernando Cheung, Lau Siu-lai, Helena Wong and Cheng Chung-tai.\nResearch[edit]\nPolyU's research focus areas include: aerospace, aviation, big data and AI, food safety, health science, infrastructure monitoring, intelligent construction, sustainability and smart city. To facilitate the implementation of cross-disciplinary research through collaborations among faculties and schools and other local and overseas institutions and partners, PolyU established a wide variety of research laboratories, institutes and centres, for instance, the Aviation Services Research Centre with Boeing.[28][29]\nThe Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel established by PolyU in 2006 acts as a focal point to enhance technological innovation in textiles and apparel industry for the development of highly competitive industrial clusters in Hong Kong.[30]\nRankings and reputation[edit]\nOverall Rankings[edit]\nGlobally, PolyU is #65 in the QS World University Rankings 2024, #87 in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2024, #100 in the US News Best Global Universities Rankings 2022\u20132023, and #151\u2013200 in ARWU 2023.\nPolyU was #94 worldwide in terms of aggregate performance across THE, QS, and, ARWU in 2022.[41]\nPolyU was named the 6th most international university in the world in 2023 by THE.\nYoung University Rankings[edit]\nPolyU was ranked #6 worldwide (#3 in Hong Kong) in the QS \"Top 50 Under 50\" list of the world's top young universities (2021) [42] and #4 worldwide (#2 in Hong Kong) in the Times Higher Education's Young University Rankings 2023.[43]\nSubject / Area Rankings[edit]\nIn the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2022: [44]\nIn the QS World University Rankings by Broad Subject Area 2022:\nIn the Times Higher Education World University Rankings by Subjects (2023):[45]\n2022 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects (GRAS) by ShanghaiRanking:\nThe Faculty of Business is ranked 1st in shipping research in the world, based on 2016 to 2018 data from Thomson Reuters' ISI Web of Science. 55th in the Top 100 World Rankings of Business Schools by University of Texas at Dallas, based on research contributions to 24 leading business journals from 2012 to 2016.[46]\nThe School of Design is among top 3 design schools in Greater China, according to Business Week (Oct 2009 issue) and top 25 design schools in the world and is the only selected design school in Asia, according to Business Insider magazine (Dec 2012 issue).\nThe School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) is ranked 1st in the category of commerce, management, tourism and services, University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP) 2019/20, [47] and 2nd in research and scholarly activities among institutions specializing in hospitality and tourism, according to the World Ranking of Top 100 Hospitality and Tourism Programs by Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research (Nov 2009 issue).[48]\nGraduate Employability Rankings[edit]\nPolyU graduates ranked #71 worldwide in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2022 and #133 worldwide in the Times Higher Education's Global University Employability Ranking 2022.[49][50] According to the \"Opinion Survey on the Public Ranking of Universities in Hong Kong\" conducted by HKUPOP (now HKPORI), PolyU graduates were the 4th (in 2015 and in 2014), 2nd (in 2016), and 3rd (in 2017) most preferred university graduates by employers in Hong Kong. [51]\nGovernance[edit]\nThe governing body of the PolyU is the Council, established in accordance with the PolyU Ordinance. The President and the Deputy President are ex officio members. There are also 17 external members from the business and professional sectors, three elected staff members, one alumni member and two elected student members.[52]The highest advisory body of the Council is the University Court, which is responsible for providing opinions on the direction of the university to promote the development of the university.[53]\nPresidents[edit]\nList of presidents of PolyU and their predecessors (known as the director of the Hong Kong Polytechnic before 1994):\nCooperation[edit]\nPolyU has established cooperative relations with more than 280 universities or institutions in 39 countries and regions around the world, and signed about 445 agreements in the areas of student exchange arrangements to joint research cooperation.[54]\nStudent life[edit]\nStudent organization[edit]\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students\u2019 Union (HKPUSU) is a student-run organization that is autonomous from the university administration for promoting the interests and welfare of full-time undergraduates (excluding postgraduate and College of Professional and Continuing Education students).\nSports teams[edit]\nStudent halls[edit]\nThere are two student halls of residence buildings provided by the university, in Hung Hom Bay and Ho Man Tin. The residential halls include:\nThe university also provides three off-campus housing sites, located in Sham Shui Po, Mong Kok, and Tsim Sha Tsui. It offers around 250 residential places at urban areas, as an accommodation option for non-local students.\nIncidents[edit]\nDemocracy wall controversy[edit]\nThe university's faculty-led Student Discipline Committee, with the support of the university council chairman Lam Tai-fai,[55] expelled one student and suspended another for one year in response to an October 2018 incident arising from a dispute over postings by students on the \"Democracy Wall\" bulletin board then managed by the students' union. The students had posted messages in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the \"Umbrella Movement\" democracy occupation protests of 2014 and calling for Hong Kong independence from the CCP-ruled People's Republic of China. Another two students were ordered to serve terms of community service. The students had been ordered by management to take them down.[56]\nThe evidence called at the disciplinary committee hearing, at which the students were denied legal representation, included video footage in which the students were observed shouting and knocking on doors. It was alleged that they had made defamatory comments, assaulted a staff member and damaged property, all of which accusations were denied by the students. The university described their behaviour as \"unruly\". Among them were a former student union leader, an elected member of the school's governing council and a former external vice-president of the student union. No avenue for appeal from a decision of the committee is available.[57]\nNumerous pro-democracy groups, including more than a dozen legislators and 19 student organisations, protested the decision of the committee. The 90,000-strong Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union described the punishments as excessive.[58]\n2019 campus siege[edit]\nIn November 2019, the university was occupied by protesters as part of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests; confrontation with the Hong Kong Police Force occurred from 17 November to 19 November. On 16 November, police attempted to enter the campus, but failed as protestors barricaded the entrance and used petrol bombs to attack them.[59][60][61][62] The police then blocked all exits of the university campus and requested all protesters inside to surrender. On 18 November, the police attempted to enter the campus again using tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bags, and sponge grenades.[63] Protestors responded by throwing petrol bombs at police.[64] The university has been described as being a battleground during the conflict.[65] The university was later sealed off by police, only several protesters managed to escape.[66] This resulted in a 3-days long standoff. More than 280 protesters were injured while more than 1,000 persons were arrested.[67]\nNotable alumni[edit]\nNotable alumni of PolyU include Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying, former Hong Kong Legislator Lam Tai-fai and Chan Kam-lam, explorer Rebecca Lee, film director Wong Kar-wai and Raman Hui, musician Paul Wong, singer Gigi Leung, fashion designer Vivienne Tam and software engineer Lui Kim-man.\nGallery[edit]\nNotes[edit]\nSee also[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nBibliography[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"

It\u2019s also made me surer of my goals.\u201d\nHe notes that each project came from a different opportunity at PolyU, which aspires to be\u00a0an innovative, world-class university with a strong sense of social responsibility. It is 65th in\u00a0the QS World University Rankings 2024, 23rd in the QS World University Rankings: Asia\u00a02024 and 4th in the Young University Rankings 2023.\nIts students go beyond the classroom with abundant resources and global opportunities to\u00a0participate in student exchange, research programmes, international Work-Integrated\u00a0Education (i.e. internships) and Service-Learning, where they give back to society.\nFostering a thirst for knowledge\nPolyU launched its Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scheme in the 2021/22 academic year to cultivate intellectual curiosity and enquiry-based learning, reinforcing Hong Kong as an international innovation hub. PolyU students can get up to HK$50,000 (S$8,500) and assistance for individual or group research projects. Since its launch, PolyU has approved over 280 projects and funded more than 410 undergraduate researchers with more than HK$13 million.\nMr Gimshan and his schoolmates tapped on the scheme to develop their de-icing aerogel: \u201cI\u00a0joined a project under the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, another discipline from my major, and learned more about materials and aircraft. I experienced what it\u2019s like being a researcher and was inspired by prominent scholars, working in a laboratory and carrying out different manufacturing processes.\u201d\nHe also honed his skills during his Service-Learning unit, where his team designed and built a rotatable dining table for wheelchairs. Units like these help students utilise their skills and knowledge to address complex social service challenges, ranging from supporting children and families with special needs to educating rural farmers on sustainable food production. These experiences cultivate deeper empathy and a robust sense of civic responsibility.\n\u201cThat was my first engineering project. It was challenging, but the teachers were supportive,\u201d\u00a0shares Mr Gimshan. \u201cWe went to PolyU\u2019s Industrial Centre, manufactured steel parts and\u00a0made a product that fully meets the needs of our client, who is a senior citizen. It was one of the best experiences and very fulfilling.\u201d\nSome of his classmates travelled to Rwanda to build solar panels for villages, or to South-east Asian countries to teach English to children. \u201cYou can help people and global\u00a0communities in various ways, and learn a lot in the process. This is a key, unique and\u00a0interesting aspect of PolyU, and many students love it and take more than one of these units,\u201d adds Mr Gimshan.\nA school for tomorrow\u2019s leaders\nMr Gimshan, who is from Sri Lanka, adds that PolyU prepares students for careers after\u00a0graduation. In these three years of study, thanks to the vast network of partnerships that PolyU has with many industries and multinational giants, he has completed three internships and accumulated working experiences in various fields, including one at the China Light and Power utility, which supplies over 80 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s electricity. He says: \u201cI discovered so much about the industry and was lucky enough to visit every power station owned by the utility.\u201d\n\u201cMy supervisor made sure that I learned as much as possible, and after seeing the work that\u00a0he does, I realised I want to do something similar in the future.\u201d\nMs Alessandra Sylva Saleh, an Indonesian student who is also in her fourth and last year at\u00a0the university, shares that its Integrated Project course also gave her a taste of working life.\u00a0During the course, students collaborate in teams on multidisciplinary projects. Her team\u00a0developed a robot to help people care for their pets.\nShe says: \u201cThe project involved many stages, from planning to design, packaging, cataloguing,\u00a0inventory and distribution management, and more. We also presented our business proposal at the end of the course, to gain experience in pitching and managing a business project in reality.\n\u201cAfter completing the course, I have a deeper appreciation for the collaboration,\u00a0communication and problem-solving skills needed to address real-world challenges. I have\u00a0also gotten to know people from other majors, which is essential for success in today\u2019s\u00a0interconnected industries.\u201d\nWith more than 2,600 undergraduate students from over 45 countries and regions at PolyU, Mr\u00a0Gimshan and Ms Sylva have made friends and forged connections with people from all parts\u00a0of the world. \u201cPolyU has so many people from different places and backgrounds. When you\u00a0meet and befriend them, you gain an international perspective and make your university life\u00a0happier,\u201d Mr Gimshan highlights.\nAs more than 9,000 foreign multinational companies have set up offices in Hong Kong, PolyU students have a global job market at their doorstep, too. Aspiring entrepreneurs among the university\u2019s students and alumni can realise their global aspirations by taking advantage of its PolyVentures ecosystem to get their start-ups off the ground.\nMr Gimshan says: \u201cPolyU is dedicated to ensuring that students have a well-rounded\u00a0learning experience that also readies them for life after university. Whether you want to\u00a0pursue a master\u2019s degree, launch a start-up or get a great job in Hong Kong and beyond,\u00a0you have all the resources that you need at PolyU.\u201d\nA variety of generous help at hand\nPolyU offers generous scholarships to prospective and current students who need financial assistance. It also nominates outstanding applicants from Belt and Road countries, such as\u00a0Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar, for the HKSAR government\u2019s Belt and Road Scholarship, which covers tuition fees.\nMr Gimshan and Ms Sylva won the Belt and Road Scholarship. \u201cWith it, international\u00a0students like us can study at an innovative, world-class university like PolyU without financial\u00a0worries,\u201d says Mr Gimshan.\nMs Sylva adds that the scholarship changed her life. \u201cWithout it, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to\u00a0study abroad. I can immerse myself in my studies and extracurricular activities because of\u00a0its generous funding. I\u2019m also motivated to achieve good grades as we must meet its criteria yearly.\u201d\nShe tells prospective students: \u201cWe have state-of-the-art facilities, like our Industrial Centre,\u00a0which is one of the best, if not the best, in Hong Kong. We have a diverse student body, and\u00a0everyone is friendly and easy-going. Hong Kong has a dynamic environment, and we\u00a0are centrally located in the city. PolyU is a great place to study, connect with global\u00a0citizens, gain working experience and get ready for the next stage of your life.\u201d\nEmbark on your journey toward innovation and excellence by applying for The Hong Kong\u00a0Polytechnic University\u2019s 2024/25 intake.
