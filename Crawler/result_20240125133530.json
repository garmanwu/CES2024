        "raw_content": "My flight home from CES 2024 proved that the world needs Auracast\nI was sitting at my gate in Las Vegas\u2019 Harry Reid airport waiting to board my red-eye home to Toronto after four days at CES 2024 when my brain\u2019s last functioning cell was jolted back to life by a mishmash of airport intercom announcements. One was a general reminder to not leave my luggage unattended, and the other, from my gate, rattled off a list of passenger names for passport verification. All very important. I think.\nThe crisscrossing audio mess was confusing to decipher, but the real-life use case provided me with the inspiration I needed to write this post about a new Bluetooth tech I demoed at the show called Auracast, which promises to make audio in public spaces like airports, bars, movie theaters, and auditoriums better and more personalized.\nThe demo, put on by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, the folks in charge of establishing Bluetooth specifications, went like this: I got a set of earbuds and an iPhone with a pretty basic Auracast app installed on it. I was then ushered to a mock airport gate they had created, numbered B23. Upon opening the app, a list of available Auracast broadcasts appeared, including Gate B23. Tapping it let me hear gate announcements clear as day in my earbuds.\nThe beauty of this is that travelers could get the information relevant to them, potentially in their own language, while not having to compete with airport noise and other general announcements. Plus, you\u2019ll be able to continue listening to your music or movie audio and the Auracast gate announcements will cut in so you don\u2019t miss anything.\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. The Bluetooth group sees the technology having wide-ranging applications, especially in public spaces. Picture going into a bar or airport lounge with several muted TVs on the walls, each playing a different sport, newscast, or TV show. In our CES demo, each TV was outfitted with an Auracast transmitter dongle (seen at the top right of the pictured TV, above), and all we had to was open the Auracast app on our phones, pick the marked TV we wanted, and then listen to the audio of the soccer match being played on it. As for the app, there was no timeline given for an official launch at the demo.\nAuditoriums, theater venues, or even movie theaters can use the tech to allow visitors to use their own headphones, earbuds, or even hearing aids to better hear public speakers (say you\u2019re way at the back), play dialogue, and even music performances. We were given a demo of an auditorium setup where users could choose from an English or Mandarin version.\nUsers will also be able to use Auracast to share the audio from their laptops or smartphones. In our CES demo, we could connect to \u201cDave\u2019s Laptop\u201d to share a movie, or \u201cLori\u2019s Phone\u201d for some music. Sound, of course, will vary depending on your headphones, but in my demo, the music and TV audio I heard sounded pretty good. Users can also set up passwords for access, and a Bluetooth SIG rep said that the distance of the broadcast can be set too \u2014 like if you want to keep it limited to just you and a nearby friend.\nHow does it work?\nAuracast is a Bluetooth technology that works in a similar way to an FM radio broadcast. It can transmit a one-way signal at a range of up to 100 meters and to an unlimited number of devices. There\u2019s no actual connection between the transmitting and receiving devices, so it can\u2019t be used to control or access information on the devices.\nWhile the tech has been around for a few years, we are now starting to see audio products such as headphones and speakers with Auracast support hit the market, such as JBL\u2019s CES-announced lineup of speakers and some of EarFun\u2019s new headphones. The folks at the Bluetooth group told me that their hope is that the tech will become standard in all kinds of devices, and eventually be accessible at the operating system level \u2014 Android and iOS devices, for example, could include it much like the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi menus on our smartphones.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean existing devices have to be left out. Transmitter hardware is also becoming available for personal and commercial use, with affordable dongles, adapters, and streamers hitting the market that can turn TVs, laptops, public address systems, and other devices into transmitters.\nThe Super Bowl is right around the corner. If you\u2019re playing host to a Super Bowl party this year or simply want to ensure you have access to the game on a big screen TV, there\u2019s some amazing TV deals taking place right now. Among them are 75-inch TVs, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve turned our focus for the big game. With a 75-inch TV you\u2019ll have plenty of room to gather around, cheer around, and eat snacks around, and with these 75-inch TV deals you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity to save as well.\nToshiba 75-inch C350 4K Smart TV \u2014 $530, was $800\nThe Toshiba 75-inch C350 4K Smart TV, like all of the best TVs, produces a stunning 4K picture at four times the resolution of Full HD. It utilizes a high performance 4K engine, Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10, and DTS Virtual X scaling technology to create a highly immersive viewing experience. It also features FireTV, which brings live, over-the-air TV, streaming channels, and your favorite apps together onto your home screen, which makes navigating and exploring content more convenient than ever. Apps such as Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu and Netflix are accessible from within the Toshiba 75-inch C350\u2019s interface, bringing even more convenience to your home theater. Free shipping is included with this deal at Best Buy, as is in-store pickup at your nearest Best Buy where inventory allows.\nLet's start this with a caveat or two: If you're going to compare streaming services merely by the number of subscribers they have, it's not exactly a fair fight. Not all services are available in the same places. Nor does the number of subscribers really address the \"worth\" of a streaming service. Or whether it's easy to use, or if the apps are any good. Or, for that matter, if a given streaming service has what you want to watch, which really is the only measure necessary.\nStill, it's interesting to keep up with how things are doing from a global perspective, especially when you have relatively young upstarts like Apple TV+ gaining so many accolades in an industry dominated by Netflix.\nIt was a big year for football in 2023, for both the American and international versions. On the pigskin front, NFL Sunday Ticket made a (mostly) successful leap to YouTube TV. And the beautiful game found a new North American home on Apple TV with MLS Season Pass.\nMajor League Soccer will be even bigger in 2024. There's a new team (with a new stadium) in St. Louis this season and another on the way in San Diego in 2025. Oh, and Lionel Messi is still in Miami. And this year, he's brought an old friend \u2014 fellow Argentinian Luis Suarez. Just in case you didn't think there'd be any major storylines this year.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

We've rounded up the nine hi-fi and audio stories that you need to know about right here.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nSonus Faber delivered the wow factor with its new Suprema system, an impressive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 loudspeaker system that\u2019ll set you back \u00a3695,000 / $750,000 for its set up of two speakers, two subwoofers, and one electronic crossover.\nThe company has described the Suprema as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d but the design of the Suprema system remains very much \u2018Sonus Faber\u2019 in its styling.\nThe speakers are 4/5-way designs with eight front-firing speakers in addition to two back-firing drivers, while the subwoofer system uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz.\nAs for the external electronic crossover, it is a dual mono and fully balanced design, with all phase cutting and control circuits purely analogue.\nThe range is available in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes. What isn\u2019t included is a house large enough to keep it in.\nREAD MORE: Sonus Faber marks 40 years with stunning Suprema speaker system, its \u201cmost ambitious project ever\u201d\nFocal Aria Evo X\nA slightly more accessible speaker line up came from Focal, in the shape of its Aria Evo X \u2014 successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nWith speakers covering both traditional stereo and surround sound setups, the range consists of five new models, including the No.1 standmount speakers, the No.2, No.3 and No.4 floorstanders and the Evo X centre speaker.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s.

Award-winning C Series at CES 2024, created with both music and TV sound in mind.\nAll wrapped up in the brand\u2019s signature Scandinavian design, the C20 packs all manner of inputs to make the most of that versatility, including a dedicated line-in, a built-in MM phono stage, and an ARC optical input for your TV.\nThe C20 can also stream music wirelessly up to 24-bit/96kHz via your choice of Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth.\nThere's 190W of power here, plus you can stereo pair a couple of C20s together using the Audio Pro app, or Apple AirPlay 2. There's even a sub-out for more low-end oomph if you need it.\nThe C20 will be available in a choice of soft satin white, stylish grey or classic black from February, and will be priced at \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550.\nREAD MORE: The Audio Pro C20 is an all-in-one speaker solution for your music and movies\nMcIntosh MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier\nAs part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, McIntosh used CES 2024 to announce one of its most powerful amplifiers to date.\nThe new MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier builds on the legacy of 2005's MC2KW, with a tri-chassis construction and 2000 watts of power to give what McIntosh promises will be \"a new industry standard for power and amplification\".\nSome of its improvements include a large-capacity power supply for better performance of low-end frequencies and improved dynamic headroom, while four bespoke McIntosh heatsinks on each power module ensure efficient heat dissipation for more consistent audio quality.\nFurther enhanced circuit designs with upgraded components and shorter signal paths should also aid sonic performance, as should the MC2.1KW's updated electrical wiring and interconnect cables.\nThe MC2.1KW will be available from January 2024 at authorised dealers for an eye-watering \u00a359,995 / \u20ac64,990 / $50,000.\nREAD MORE: McIntosh's 75th-anniversary monoblock amp aims to set a new industry standard for power\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire was one of four turntables unveiled by the brand at CES 2024, but this one caught our eye for its ability to wirelessly stream gorgeous vinyl sound all around your house.\nIt follows in the footsteps of last year's\u00a0Stream Carbon, which worked with Sonos to do just that. However, the Sapphire adds to this with UPnP and\u00a0Roon\u00a0support too, enabling playback through a whole load more compatible devices, all without the need for any further equipment.\nOf course, there are also gold-plated RCA outputs for traditional wired systems and powered speakers too. Expect it to cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nREAD MORE: The Victrola Stream Sapphire turntable can stream vinyl sound all round your house\nJBL Xtreme 4\nJBL announced the latest iteration of its rugged Bluetooth speaker, the Xtreme 4 \u2014 and this time round, it\u2019s leaning on AI to get the very best sound quality from it.\nThe AI Sound Boost feature sees an AI algorithm analysing your music in real time to optimise what you hear, resulting in a more powerful and less distorted sound.\nThe Xtreme 4 is also one of the first JBL wireless speakers to support\u00a0Auracast.\nIt retains its rugged capabilities, with an IP67 rating, plus a 24-hour battery life, with the ability to use it as a charger for your phone if you\u2019re caught short. You can even replace the battery further down the line if you need to.\nIt\u2019ll cost \u00a3330 / $380 / \u20ac350 when it goes on sale in March.\nREAD MORE: JBL\u2019s Xtreme 4 wireless speaker uses AI to boost sound quality\nRoon Nucleus Titan\nMark this in the \u201cserious hi-fi purchase\u201d column, but Roon used CES 2024 to announce a new flagship server, called the Nucleus Titan.\nLike Roon's previous flagship, the Nucleus Plus, the new Nucleus Titan is a dedicated server/streamer solution that has been optimised to work with Roon's OS to deliver \"bit-perfect playback\" of your hi-res digital music collection to a Roon-compatible hi-fi system.\nWhere the new top-tier server surpasses its predecessor is in performance quality and a self-cooling design with \"silent, fan-less operation\".\nThe Titan also sports two USB-C and two USB-A inputs, along with two audio-only HDMI ports. Its internal storage comes in three sizes: 2TB, 4TB and 8TB. Multiroom audio setups are also supported.\nCosting $3699 before adding storage (and your Roon subscription), this is a something of luxury purchase, to say the least.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0news of its new outdoor lights\u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song.\u00a0Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs?

        "raw_content": "Bluetooth Blog\nThe Best Bluetooth Experience at CES 2024\nFrom innovation in automobiles and home entertainment to new achievements in security and robotics, there\u2019s no shortage of amazing tech to take in at CES 2024. If you had a chance to attend, you were no doubt introduced to some incredible advancements. However, you might have missed the best CES experience \u2013 a comprehensive tour of the latest Bluetooth\u00ae audio innovation.\nSet up in the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), in collaboration with several member companies like Qualcomm, Intel, Telelink, Airoha, Nordic Semiconductor, and more, hosted the North American debut of The Auracast\u2122 Experience at CES. The Auracast\u2122 Experience is a global event series designed to give media, analysts, and industry enthusiasts an exclusive, hands-on look at Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio.\nAuracast\u2122 broadcast audio is a new Bluetooth capability that enables an audio transmitter to broadcast audio to an unlimited number of receivers. A transmitter can be a smartphone, laptop, TV, or even a public address or sound system, and receivers are headphones, speakers, earbuds, or even hearing aids. Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio will enable exciting new audio experiences that will enhance the way we engage with each other and the world around us.\nAuracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio at CES\nAttendees at The Auracast\u2122 Experience had the opportunity to personally experience this new broadcasting capability firsthand. In addition to getting an exclusive look at a product showcase featuring Auracast\u2122 enabled smartphones, speakers, hearing aids, earbuds, streamers, public transmitters, and other end products from major manufacturers, visitors took part in several simulated Auracast\u2122 scenarios: arriving at an airport to travel to an international conference, navigating the airport terminal, and listening to keynote speeches at a public venue.\nParticipants were provided with Auracast\u2122 compatible earbuds and a smartphone with an Auracast\u2122 app for scanning, receiving, and playing Auracast\u2122 broadcasts (soon, bring-your-own-device usage will be increasingly accessible as more devices become compatible with Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio).\nEven though the smartphone and earbuds are paired, the smartphone is not the audio source. The audio source, the Auracast\u2122 transmitter, is separate, and participants were able to select and receive various Auracast\u2122 broadcasts through the app, similar to choosing from available Wi-Fi networks.\nAuracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio in an Airport Bar\nThe event began with a hands-on experience. Participants visited an area designed to resemble the sports bar of an airport. In such bars, it is common for multiple muted TV monitors to show various sports at once, but customers are often unable to hear the commentary.\nFor this demonstration, the TVs were equipped with GN ReSound TV streamers (now available) which allowed them to\u00a0deliver audio as Auracast\u2122 transmitters. Attendees were able to use the Auracast\u2122 app on their smartphones to select the TV of their choice and listen via their Auracast\u2122 compatible earbuds, then switch to the audio of another TV by selecting a new broadcast, without a moment\u2019s delay.\nAnd this experience is not limited to sports bars. Silent TVs in hospital waiting rooms, in gymnasiums, on trains, and more are all ideal spaces where Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio can enhance the watching experience.\nThe Auracast\u2122 Experience\nThe Auracast\u2122 Experience is a global series of immersive demonstration events that allow visitors to experience some of the ways Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio will help our world sound better.\nPlay the full video\nHow to Share Your Audio with Auracast\u2122\nHow Auracast\u2122 Will Unmute Your World\nHow to Hear Your Best with Auracast\u2122\nAuracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio at the Airport Gate\nNext, attendees got a chance to see how Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio can be used to share audio with friends and family. While waiting in the airport lounge, a colleague asked them to join in watching a movie together on their laptop. Participants were also invited to listen to music via another colleague\u2019s smartphone. Invitations were simultaneously received via the Auracast\u2122 app. Visitors scanned the available Auracast\u2122 broadcasts and selected the one they wanted to hear. This allowed the audio being shared by colleagues to stream directly into their earbuds.\nDuring these personal audio-sharing scenarios, only those with the necessary passwords were able to participate, ensuring privacy while allowing more people to enjoy the same audio at once, each on their individual pairs of earbuds.\nAdditionally, using the Auracast\u2122 app on your smartphone to scan and receive Auracast\u2122 broadcasts related to your boarding gate lets you receive important information being shared over the public address system directly into your headphones. Even while enjoying movies or music, if the airport\u2019s announcement system is Auracast\u2122 compatible, you can opt to receive those announcements directly and never again worry about missing important flight information.\nAuracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio in an Auditorium\nLastly, attendees arrived at the lecture hall for the conference. In this simulated scenario, participants show up a few minutes late and can only find seating at the back of the auditorium where, often, it can be difficult to hear the presenter. However, since this auditorium is set up to support Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio, attendees were able to listen at the optimal volume to suit their needs via the highest audio quality available on their own earbuds, no matter where in the auditorium they were seated. And, since multi-lingual options were offered by the venue, participants could choose between hearing the lecture in English or Mandarin.\nLastly, at this point in the tour, attendees had the opportunity to hear the audio from their guide\u2019s microphone in their Auracast\u2122 earbuds. Watching the tour guide speak while hearing that person\u2019s voice via the earbuds, participants heard no perceptible lag or audio delay.\u00a0Extremely low latency, like what visitors experienced, is the only way to avoid an echo effect or lip-sync problems. This is critical for people with hearing loss \u2013 especially if they have partial hearing loss or hearing loss in only one ear.\nAuracast\u2122 broadcast audio also includes further support for hearing aids and, combined with traditional hearing assistance measures, the result is a vast improvement in audio accessibility for all. This is particularly important as populations age, increasing the number of individuals experiencing hearing loss.\nThe Future Is Auracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio\nA year ago, the specifications were available, but discussion regarding the potential for Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio was largely conceptual. Now, CES 2024 represents a significant milestone in Auracast\u2122 adoption. Not only are we seeing live demonstrations of this technology in action, but enabling technology (silicon, modules, etc.) is now readily available, and product and solution vendors have started to bring end products to market \u2013 including retrofit products that will help speed adoption.\nLearn more about Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio.\nAnd check out the gallery from The Auracast\u2122 Experience at CES 2024 bellow.\nFEATURED INNOVATION\nAuracast\u2122 Broadcast Audio\nAuracast\u2122 broadcast audio will deliver life-changing audio experiences that will enhance the way you engage with others and the world around you.\nLEARN MORE\nA few months back, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) held The AuracastTM Experience\u2026\nRead More\nFrom innovation in automobiles and home entertainment to new achievements in security and robotics,\u2026\nRead More\nFrom 5G-enabled smartphones that double as pro-level cameras and gaming devices to connected vehicles\u2026\nRead More\nA global provider of secure, intelligent wireless technology for a more connected world, Silicon\u2026\nRead More\nIn this video, Andrew Bellavia shares his experience demoing the new Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio\u2026\nWatch Now\nAuracast\u2122 product momentum is growing, and one emerging category is Auracast\u2122 retrofit transmitters.\nWatch Now\nHow can we make hearing more inclusive and accessible for all?

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nBluetooth Auracast is everywhere at CES 2024. So, what is it?\nBroadcast audio is coming to airports, museums and even your home.\nOne of the key advantages of Bluetooth LE Audio is Auracast: a way to broadcast content to connected devices in public settings. It will also allow you to easily connect multiple wireless speakers to each other with diving into an app. Perhaps most importantly, the barrier to entry is going to be very low since a dedicated Auracast app will be built into mobile platforms like iOS and Android. What's more, you'll select available channels like you would a Bluetooth device or a Wi-Fi network. It's simple, and it's presented in a way that people who've used a smartphone are familiar with. Auracast has been mentioned constantly by companies announcing their new audio gear at CES 2024, so here's what you need to know about it.\nWhat is Auracast?\nSimply put, Auracast is broadcast audio over Bluetooth. An Auracast transmitter, which in public settings can be a pro-grade add-on to a TV or a box that looks like a Wi-Fi router mounted on the wall. You can also create your own channels from a phone or laptop to share music of the sound from a TV show. This means that you'll be able to have the audio from muted airport TVs beamed to your headphones or earbuds when traveling. Auracast will also allow you to keep tabs on flight and gate information without interrupting your layover entertainment.\nDuring its CES demo, Bluetooth SIG, the organization that defines Bluetooth standards, allowed show-goers to experience the aforementioned airport TV scenario. It was easy to switch between two sports broadcasts in a faux bar, simply by tapping one or the other in the Auracast menu. Another tap let us hear a private stream from a laptop, which was password protected so only the proper invitees can access it. There's also a use case where live audio from a lecture or performance can be broadcast via Auracast directly to earbuds, hearing aids or other Bluetooth listening devices. Impressively, there's no lag across any of the options as the visuals matched up perfectly each time.\n\"The analogy I would use is very similar to setting up a personal hotspot,\" Chuck Saban, senior director for market development at the Bluetooth, explained about those private Auracasts. \"You would set up a personal audio hotspot, it's going to be encrypted, and then anybody who is around me who has that passcode can listen.\"\nAuracast will also help you link multiple Bluetooth speakers together at the press of a button. Until now, most companies had you select the devices in an app. But companies like JBL are putting dedicated Auracast buttons on some of their new devices. On the company's PartyBox line, for example, you'll press the button on the main speaker you connected to your phone and then all you have to do is press the button on successive units to link them. What's more, you can chain together an infinite number of speakers in this scenario.\nWhat devices is Auracast available on?\nAuracast is a feature of Bluetooth LE Audio that arrived with Bluetooth 5.2. So technically, any earbuds, headphones, hearing aids, speakers and other devices that have that version of the wireless standard will be able to tune into Auracast. However, Bluetooth 5.3 offers a more robust implementation of the broadcast audio tool.\n\"What you get with 5.3 is the ISOC channels capability in the core that allows multiple independent channel capabilities,\" Saban said. \"You effectively can parse out the left and right [channels] from the source itself.\" He further explained that the processing of all of that has been moved to the phone from the earbuds or headphones themselves, which extends battery life, performance and efficiency for Bluetooth devices.\nWhen will Auracast be available?\nPlenty of Bluetooth devices support Bluetooth 5.2 or 5.3 and LE Audio. Since Auracast is part of Bluetooth, there's no extra tech needed to include it, the products just need to support the recent versions of the wireless standard. From there, it's up to the individual companies to flip the switch on LE Audio and Auracast. Over the course of 2023 and here at CES, tons of audio brands have said they are planning to add support for the feature via over-the-air updates later in 2024.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

        "raw_content": "Bluetooth Blog\nQualcomm Gives Us an Overview of What We Can Expect From Bluetooth Audio in 2024\nFrom 5G-enabled smartphones that double as pro-level cameras and gaming devices to connected vehicles and cities to the technology behind the smart factories, you interact with products and technologies made possible by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.\nevery day. For years, Qualcomm Technologies has worked extensively with Bluetooth\u00ae audio and connectivity, and their portfolio of Bluetooth audio solutions power many of the true wireless earbuds, headphones, and speakers from some of the world\u2019s biggest audio and mobile OEMs.\nI recently connected with Chris Havell, senior director, product marketing, Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd., to gain a better understanding of what Qualcomm Technologies predicts for Bluetooth audio in the coming year.\nQ&A With Chris Havell From Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd.\n2023 has been an amazing year for Bluetooth\u00ae technology, and I think the launch of Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio has captured the attention of the industry and end users. We know from our latest Qualcomm State of Sound research that consumers are very interested in the experiences that Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio will enable. In fact, a massive 75 percent of our respondents this year said they were interested in Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio features. That\u2019s why we were so excited to be involved in The Auracast\u2122 Experience event at Mobile World Congress and other global industry events this year.\nDuring The Auracast\u2122 Experience, visitors were able to experience, for the first time, multiple Bluetooth wireless audio broadcasts in the same location, as well as experience how Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio will help users share audio with others, tune into audio assistance or translations during a conference, tune into airport gate announcements, and unmute silent TVs in public spaces. These experiences are supported by earbuds built on the Qualcomm\u00ae S5 Sound Platform, one of the first Bluetooth SoCs to support Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio.\nThe launch of Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio has captured the attention of the industry and end users.\nIn addition to these amazing audio-sharing experiences, we have also taken advantage of Bluetooth LE Audio to deliver lower latencies and more immersive experiences for gaming and spatial audio applications. Just two years ago, Bluetooth audio latency was at 200ms, and in 2023, we were able to deliver a solution optimized for gaming, utilizing our Snapdragon\u2122 Sound Technology Suite and Bluetooth LE Audio to deliver a latency of less than 20ms. Spatial audio experiences will also benefit from lower latencies enabled by LE Audio, allowing the audio to instantly follow you when you move your head for a much more immersive and natural spatial audio experience.\nIn 2024, I think we will see the expansion and adoption of hearing personalization capabilities on Bluetooth\u00ae earbuds and headphones. This is another area that we know consumers are interested in which was reflected in our State of Sound consumer research this year. In fact, 65 percent of our respondents said that they struggle to hear in busy workplaces, lecture halls, and meeting rooms. Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing assistant adoption has been slower than expected, and I think this is due to many people feeling that their hearing isn\u2019t poor enough to warrant a dedicated hearing aid. However, if their day-to-day earbuds supported hearing assistance features, thanks to Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio, then they would be much more likely to use and benefit from them.\nUsing earbuds for health and wellness monitoring is another area where I think there will be strong growth in 2024.\nUsing earbuds for health and wellness monitoring is another area where I think there will be strong growth in 2024, and there are some very compelling use cases around sleep improvement and management, personal health, and stress monitoring. Developers will be able to take advantage of the much lower power and flexibility enabled by Bluetooth LE Audio and combine this with the powerful on-earbud AI enabled by our latest Qualcomm\u00ae S7 Sound and Qualcomm S7 Pro Sound Platforms to deliver seamless and responsive user experiences that have the potential to make a positive impact on the daily lives of end users.\nMARKET RESEARCH\nLE Audio: The Future of Bluetooth\u00ae Audio\nGet new forecasts about when and which audio devices will adopt Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio, along with predictions for when public locations will deploy this new Bluetooth capability to enable new audio use cases in their venues.\nINSTANT DOWNLOAD\nWe\u2019re seeing a very strong demand for support in developing devices with Bluetooth\u00ae LE Audio technology alongside multi-device co-existence with Bluetooth Classic source devices. This is because, as LE Audio adoption begins, there is still a need to support Bluetooth Classic audio.\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on developing Bluetooth\u00ae audio platforms that enable our customers to bring all the benefits of Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio to consumers. And I\u2019m very excited to say that we will see many of these devices come to market over the next few months.\n2023 has been about delivering platforms that will help enable the LE Audio ecosystem. Alongside the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and other LE Audio vendors, we proved that the technology is ready for mass market adoption and will enable many breakthrough user experiences. One example of this was at our recent Snapdragon Summit event in Hawaii, where we delivered our keynote translation to delegates via Auracast\u2122 broadcast audio.\nIn 2024, we will begin to see just how transformative LE Audio technology will be in the real world, and we will continue to leverage LE Audio technology to help develop more consumer-centric applications, including gaming and hearing personalization.\nI think the past 25 years have been amazing. We\u2019ve gone from a position where few people would wear Bluetooth\u00ae wireless headsets to a time now where wireless earbuds are just the norm for most people. We\u2019ve also evolved from a time when audiophiles would scoff at ever using Bluetooth wireless audio streaming to a position where lossless audio and high-res audio can now be delivered over a Bluetooth link thanks to technologies like Snapdragon Sound and Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 Audio.\nBluetooth\u00ae technology will also have a huge part to play as we think about multi-device experiences.\nAnd, as we look forward to the next 25 years, we\u2019ll continue to see the capabilities evolve \u2013 expanding on range, latency, and audio quality to deliver wireless experiences that will enhance our day-to-day lives whether we are working, relaxing, traveling, or socializing. Bluetooth technology will also have a huge part to play as we think about multi-device experiences \u2013 in terms of how devices can transition between use cases and connect to each other, and also how connectivity has a fundamental role to play alongside AI in terms of delivering truly seamless experiences.\nQualcomm, Snapdragon, and Snapdragon Sound are trademarks or registered trademarks of Qualcomm Incorporated. aptX is a trademark or registered trademark of Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
