Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation. The company is committed to providing optimized hydrogen mobility solutions, building on the foundation of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\nAlso on display, the mobile fuel cell generator supplies electricity solely through the fuel cell stack without the need for additional auxiliary power storage devices. It can be used in various fields and can provide power in emergencies, such as power outages, or challenging environments where accessing another power supply is difficult.\nThe mobile fuel cell generator is actively used in Electric Touring Car Racing (ETCR) competitions. To ensure the seamless operation of high-performance electric vehicles for all participating companies in the competition, Hyundai Motor has established a charging infrastructure using its hydrogen fuel cell system. The racing cars in the ETCR series recharge their batteries using electricity generated by the fuel cell generator produced by the Group.\nNext to the media table, a sectional model displays the operating principle of a portable hydrogen fuel cell generator, allowing a detailed examination of its structure for easy understanding.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram provides environmentally friendly public transportation, contributing to the purification and production of clean air. The hydrogen fuel cell tram is equipped with four hydrogen fuel cells with a capacity of 95 kW and can travel up to 150 km. It purifies approximately 800 \u03bcg of fine dust and produces 107.6 kg of clean air per hour of operation.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram is wireless, which does not require tram overhead lines, improving the aesthetics of the city and reducing infrastructure costs. Hyundai Rotem will continuously expand its lineup, including hydrogen high-speed trains, electric multiple units and locomotives.\nBooth visitors can also learn about how Hyundai Steel is preparing to establish a green steel production system to cut carbon emissions in the steel production process. It aims to reduce both direct and indirect carbon emissions by 12 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBy introducing eco-friendly processes that replace blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces and utilizing hydrogen and renewable energy instead of coal energy, the carbon emissions in the steel production process are significantly reduced.\nHyundai Motor is emphasizing its commitment to realizing the hydrogen vision at the Group level by showcasing a video inside the exhibition booth that explains the hydrogen demonstration projects and core technologies conducted by the group. This effort aims to highlight the company\u2019s ongoing dedication to making the hydrogen vision a reality.\nFostering a paradigm shift with the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019)\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai Motor showcases exhibits and videos introducing core \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) technologies under development by the Group\u2019s global software center, 42dot, emphasizing the importance of software (SW) and AI in becoming a smart mobility solutions provider.\nHyundai Motor aims to redefine everything from vehicles to all surrounding environments with SW and AI, promoting the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019). Its CES exhibit highlights the Group\u2019s current practical software-defined mobility services alongside technologies fostering the extension of SDx.\nThe SDV Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architecture represents the core hardware structure of SDV, showcasing the operational framework and functional structure where the vehicle\u2019s cameras, radars and sensors gather driving environment data, enabling autonomous driving through the integrated controller, a High-Performance Vehicle Computer (HPVC) embedded within the vehicle. This exhibit illustrates how the vehicle\u2019s hardware structure gets simplified through the transition toward SDV, providing a more intuitive view.\nBased on driving scenes in Pangyo, South Korea played on the display in the front of the exhibit, actual road scenarios, such as left and right turns, are staged to illustrate the data flow where the HPVC and zone controllers for autonomous driving are activated according to the road environment. This flow is visualized through LED lights. Moreover, it\u2019s possible to observe the operation of a \u2018fault-tolerant\u2019 function within SDV safety features, where even if one controller malfunctions, another controller takes over to ensure safe driving.\nThe HPVC exhibited alongside the SDV architecture serves as the integrated hardware consolidating core SDV technologies. It controls all other controllers within the SDV, functioning as the brain of the SDV, enabling the application of software technologies in the vehicle. The HPVC aids in driving assistance and acts as a gateway between data generated within the vehicle, facilitating the application of software technologies in the vehicle. It plays a significant role, vastly enhancing the vehicle\u2019s performance, safety and convenience.\nTwo HPVC models developed by 42dot are available at one of the six media tables in the central software section within the booth. These models differ in their cooling methods: one uses air cooling, dissipating heat through air, while the other utilizes liquid cooling with water.\n42dot is not only developing HPVC and controllers but also developing an SDV operating system, SDV OS, to ensure stable and efficient operation of in-vehicle applications. On the additional five media tables positioned to the right and above the HPVC exhibits, visitors can watch videos introducing the five core SDV technologies under development by 42dot and a film of various Group-wide practical software-defined mobility services in motion that are being operated today.\nThe five core technologies introduced through the videos include:\n\u2022HPVC and SDV OS: A modern data center-like network architecture and fault-tolerant system for SDVs\n\u2022Data-Driven Learning Systems: Continuous integration and deployment of autonomous driving from R&D to commercial robo-taxi service through MLOps and DataOps\n\u2022Safety-Designed Vehicle: Technology for cybersecurity and safe driving control\n\u2022LLM for Advanced Mobility: Conversational AI assistant that enhances human-like interaction between SDVs and drivers/passengers\n\u2022Self-Managed Smart City: SDV technologies extending beyond vehicles into the city\nFurthermore, Hyundai Motor displays a video on software-defined mobility services in motion equipped with advanced technologies operated by various companies within the Group.

        "raw_content": "Hydrogen is back. At least, CES 2024 suggests it is.\nHyundai, Nikola, Bosch and others are seriously pushing fuel cells, but why now?\nHydrogen has always been presented by automakers and politicians as an alternate clean-energy option for electric vehicles, but it\u2019s never really caught on. Don\u2019t tell anyone at CES 2024, though, as this year\u2019s show floor was littered with vehicles of all sizes that are hydrogen-powered.\nThere has been so much focus on battery-powered electric vehicles over the last few years that it seemed like hydrogen might be left in the proverbial dust. So is hydrogen power about to experience a comeback? Or is it yet another example of companies making promises at CES that they won\u2019t be able to keep?\nLet\u2019s start by looking at what was at the show this year.\nPerhaps no company is more married to hydrogen power than Nikola. The trucking startup was founded around the idea of a big rig with a fuel cell, and its former CEO Trevor Milton went to great lengths \u2014 to the point of criminal fraud charges \u2014 to promote it.\nNikola has spent the last few years trying to build itself anew with Milton in the rear view. In order to do that, the startup put off the hydrogen truck in favor of an all-electric version, which it started shipping in 2021.\nAt CES, Nikola finally showed off one of its first U.S.-built hydrogen trucks that it\u2019s starting to ship to customers. If there\u2019s a future where a reimagined Nikola helped usher in the proliferation of hydrogen-powered trucks, this is where that begins.\nAnother startup at the Vegas trade show, Croft Motors, is developing \u201crugged\u201d hydrogen-powered vehicles. The firm is starting with a three-row, prototype SUV with an \u201canticipated 1,000 miles of driving range,\u201d co-founder Isaac Holeman told TechCrunch.\nHoleman believes the recent slowdown in battery-electric vehicle adoption has made it the \u201cright time to reignite that conversation\u201d about hydrogen\u2019s potential. Croft is also developing a refrigerator-sized device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen (a process called electrolysis). Holeman argued that \u201cdistributed fueling products\u201d such as Croft\u2019s will enable \u201crapid\u201d hydrogen vehicle adoption.\nFar on the other end of the spectrum, well-established automaker Hyundai also appears to be embracing hydrogen in a new way.\nThe Korean automaker has spent decades working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, and says the tech will play a \u201cprominent role\u201d in the Hyundai Group\u2019s attempt to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050.\nWhat that looks like involves not just an attempt at popularizing cars and SUVs that run on hydrogen, but doing the same for all of the heavy-duty vehicles it makes. Hyundai says these construction vehicles are too big and require too much energy to run on battery power. Instead, the firm argues hydrogen makes more sense as a clean energy source. It\u2019s worth noting that HD Hyundai, a construction equipment, refinery and shipping conglomerate that spun out of the parent company in 2002, had one of the larger displays at CES 2024.\n\u201cOur goal is build up [an] entire hydrogen energy ecosystem across the whole of the earth, from ocean to land,\u201d Dongwook Lee, president of HD Hyundai, said during a press conference. He said Hyundai wants to incorporate hydrogen power into everything it makes, from shipbuilding to construction machinery, and that it wants to create production and storage solutions, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already part of our short-term roadmap to commercialize alternative clean-hydrogen production methods,\u201d said Chang Hwan Kim, who oversees fuel cell and battery development at Hyundai. The executive said Hyundai is working to turn \u201csewage sludge and other forms of organic waste\u201d into clean hydrogen.\nSuppliers are invested, too. Bosch, which already makes hydrogen fuel cells (like the one Nikola uses in its truck), announced it will make an engine that can combust hydrogen, skipping the process where that energy gets converted to electricity and stored in a battery. Truck-builder PACCAR was also at the show with two of its newest hydrogen-powered trucks, one under the Kenworth brand, and one Peterbilt. The company said this week it has received \u201cmore than 150 paid deposits\u201d for hydrogen trucks across those two brands, and that it expects to ship them next year.\nImage credits: Natalie Christman for TechCrunch\nChanneling Vegas more than the others, South Korean energy and manufacturing giant SK Group attempted to hype its hydrogen and AI business via a theme park of sorts at CES. The rides included a small train \u201ccapable of being powered by hydrogen energy\u201d and an \u201cAI fortune teller.\u201d\nWhy now?\nThere\u2019s political will, and money. Federal investments in green hydrogen and refueling infrastructure \u2014 two big obstacles to widespread adoption \u2014 are giving HFCVs a boost. That\u2019s crucial, since nearly all hydrogen fuel is produced with fossil fuels today, and there\u2019s currently little infrastructure to keep HFCVs running, whether they\u2019re passenger cars or heavy-duty trucks.\nFor one, the 2022 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law put $9.5 billion toward \u201cclean hydrogen initiatives\u201d to create hydrogen production \u201chubs\u201d across the U.S. Some of these hubs will create green hydrogen via renewable energy and electrolysis.\nHydrogen transport is also getting a lift from the same legislation that incentivizes battery-electric vehicle sales. Alongside the EV tax credit, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created a hydrogen production credit, which offers producers as much as $3 per kilogram to offset the higher cost associated with clean hydrogen production.\nAs part of the IRA, the Federal Highway Administration announced during (though not at) CES hundreds of millions of dollars for new charging and fueling infrastructure \u2014 with a huge chunk of it going to hydrogen.\nThere\u2019s also corporate interest from the fossil fuel industry, which put tens of millions of dollars toward hydrogen lobbying efforts in the first three quarters of 2023. For example, Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil are all members of a lobbying group called the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition. Despite its tidy name, the group argues that fossil fuels such as natural gas should play a role in the \u201cclean hydrogen ecosystem\u201d when paired with carbon-capture tech. The trouble is, methane chronically leaks along the supply chain, and though the gas doesn\u2019t stick around long in the atmosphere, it\u2019s \u201c80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide,\u201d per the United Nations.\nWhile there\u2019s corporate and political interest, hydrogen-powered vehicles remain relatively scarce. The reasons are complex, but the lack of infrastructure is a critical one.\nFor one, the U.S. energy grid already exists. Though it\u2019s ancient, it\u2019s the backbone supporting tens of thousands of EV stations across the country. Hydrogen refueling stations, on the other hand, are a lot harder to come by.\nAnother reason is waste; Light-duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are generally less efficient than battery-electric vehicles, according to Gregory Keoleian, who co-directs Sustainable Systems and MI Hydrogen at the University of Michigan. Around 30% of the energy required for electrolysis is lost, and further losses come from transporting, compressing and converting hydrogen back into electricity via a fuel cell. \u201cSo, if you have limited renewable electricity, putting it into battery electric vehicles is going to be much more effective to decarbonize,\u201d Keoleian said in a call with TechCrunch.\nAnd yet, as Hyundai, Nikola and other hydrogen-focused firms argue, the advantages of battery-electric vehicles aren\u2019t as pronounced in some areas. Keoleian explained, \u201cFor medium and heavy duty trucks, aviation, and ships, hydrogen can play a decarbonization role, especially where battery electric vehicles are problematic due to heavy loads, range, and fueling time requirements.\u201d\nTo his point, EV batteries are many times heavier than fuel cells, and they take hours to fully recharge. Refueling a hydrogen-powered vehicle, on the other hand, is about as time consuming as filling up a conventional gas tank. The catch is, companies need to actually make the fuel affordable and accessible, without prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels.\nProduction and distribution remains one of the biggest bottlenecks, according to Niklas Wahlberg, head of Partnerships and System Solutions at Volvo. But he says interest in the energy source is growing. \u201cHydrogen is becoming more and more of a tangible alternative,\u201d Wahlberg says.\nAnd while Nikola became something of a bad poster child for hydrogen power over the last few years, Wahlberg says he doesn\u2019t think that really set the industry back. \u201cOf course there will be companies who have difficulties,\u201d he says. \u201cThings are progressing very well. And this is an area that we and others are very, very keen on developing.\u201d\nUpdated January 12, 2024 with additional context from Gregory Keoleian."
