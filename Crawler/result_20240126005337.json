        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Last week\u2019s launch of our Mozaic platform delivers a combination of technology advances, including HAMR, that collectively address data center operators\u2019 most important challenges: cost, power and space.

As of the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $787 million, and there were 210 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables.\nSeagate has issued a Supplemental Financial Information document, which is available on Seagate\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board\") declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which will be payable on April 4, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 21, 2024. The payment of any future quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagate\u2019s financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe business outlook for the fiscal third quarter 2024 is based on our current assumptions and expectations; actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this release.\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal third quarter 2024:\nRevenue of $1.65 billion, plus or minus $150 million\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.25, plus or minus $0.20\nGuidance regarding non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes known pre-tax charges related to estimated share-based compensation expenses of $0.15 per share.\nWe have not reconciled our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal third quarter 2024 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, other than estimated share-based compensation expenses, because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net (gain) loss recognized from early redemption of debt, purchase order cancellation fees, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges, income tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal third quarter 2024 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.\nInvestor Communications\nSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET that can be accessed on its Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.\nAn archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com shortly following the event conclusion.\nAbout Seagate\nSeagate Technology is the leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage solutions.

operations, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user\u2019s overall understanding of the Company\u2019s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company\u2019s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods.

Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company\u2019s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nBIS settlement penalty\nThe Company accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\"), which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nNet loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\nPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nPurchase order cancellation fees\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nRestructuring and other, net\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company\u2019s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nShare-based compensation\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company\u2019s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.\nStrategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nOther charges\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt, net gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap, pandemic-related lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240124576394/en/\nContacts\nInvestor Relations Contact: Shanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600shanye.hudson@seagate.com\nMedia Contact: Gregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092gregory.belloni@seagate.com\nRelated Quotes\nTRENDING"

Seagate offers innovative IT solutions for seamless data management and storage.\nTable of Contents:\nNo matter your company\u2019s size or industry, today\u2019s business landscape is throwing challenges and disruptions from every direction. In most cases, an information technology (IT) strategy plays a central role in meeting these issues head-on.\nEconomic uncertainty persists. Inflation remains stubborn. Labor and talent shortages haven\u2019t been solved. Technical debt is growing. And increasing data regulation and security standards require new security and IT governance standards.\nOrganizations planning their IT budgets and strategic plans for 2024 need to address these trends and look for opportunities. Here are some of the most important initiatives to consider when developing an IT strategy and unlocking your company\u2019s potential.\nData Privacy and Security\nSince the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018, data privacy laws have been increasing across the globe. Gartner predicts that, by 2024,75% of the global population will have its personal data protected under a local and/or national data privacy regulation.\nThe growth of data privacy regulations has also elevated consumer expectations about data protection and security. Along with legislative data regulations, businesses must meet evolving, industry-specific compliance standards while also investing in a technology strategy that implements modern security solutions to keep customer data safe.\nKey Regulations and Laws Affecting Data Privacy\nAlong with existing data regulations such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), IT departments must also stay on top of new regulatory requirements that will go into effect in 2024, including:\nStrategies for Adapting to Changing IT Laws and Regulations\nEnterprise IT departments must develop a comprehensive plan for meeting these varied privacy requirements and maintaining compliance across the organization. Solutions like Seagate Lyve can empower your data infrastructure with a flexible, cost-efficient, secure cloud storage solution offering high accessibility while helping to meet robust compliance requirements.\nMeanwhile, Seagate hardware solutions such as Exos\u00ae CORVAULT\u2122 offer state-of-the-art security features\u2014including self-encrypting hard drives\u2014to help you build an efficient, sustainable data center while making it easier to adapt to changing data regulation.\nMulticloud Strategy\nMulticloud environments bring together cloud architectures from multiple providers to create a more flexible, scalable architecture to support your business needs. Increased cloud features, controllable economies of scale, and a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) are all achievable through a multicloud environment.\nChallenges and Considerations for Implementing a Multicloud Storage Setup\nBefore you attempt to implement a multicloud infrastructure, your IT department should identify and account for the challenges you\u2019ll likely face when creating this environment. Planning will help reduce your overall IT costs, streamline adoption, and accelerate time to value.\nThese challenges include:\nIntegration and Interoperability of Different Cloud Platforms\nSuccessful multicloud strategies in 2024 will prioritize integration and interoperability when planning and executing the creation of these environments. For best results, prioritize the following:\nIT Governance and Leadership\nAs the demands placed on enterprise IT grow more expansive and complex, IT governance is required to make sure these investments and initiatives are meeting their individual goals while serving the larger objectives of the business.\nA more structured approach to IT decision-making is often required.\nEffective IT Governance Frameworks\nA number of IT governance frameworks have been developed over the years to make governance processes more manageable and consistent. While some of these frameworks offer a comprehensive plan for executing IT governance, others cater to specific use cases.\nSome of the most used IT governance frameworks are:\nRole of IT Leaders in Shaping IT Strategies\nIT governance frameworks are essential to organizing and optimizing a comprehensive technology strategy, but chief information officers and other IT leaders must incorporate their own expertise and strategic vision to implement a technology strategy that will contribute to the company\u2019s long-term success.\nThese critical leadership contributions include:\nStrategies for Aligning IT with Business Goals\nIT leaders are responsible for maintaining alignment between the IT department and the larger organization. As the main point of contact between IT and the rest of the C-suite, this alignment can be achieved through the following:\nEmerging Technologies: AI, Blockchain, and Internet of Things\nAs information technology leaders develop strategic plans for 2024 and beyond, emerging technologies will be the engine driving IT innovation and unlocking new capabilities and efficiencies.\nHowever, with so many emerging technologies at their disposal, these organizations must take a strategic approach to choosing the best investments.\nPotential Impact of Emerging Technologies on IT Strategies\nBusinesses focused on long-term growth and sustainable IT practices should be aggressive and open-minded in identifying emerging technologies that are aligned with the company\u2019s goals. IT leaders should also consider the many ways emerging technologies can make a strong impact on business:\nStrategies for Adopting and Integrating New Technologies\nTo maximize the value of your emerging technology investments, approach these investments through a strategic evaluation that incorporates the following steps:\nSeagate Helps Align Your Data Storage with Your Future Goals\nAs your business plans its upcoming technology investments, make sure your enterprise storage infrastructure is set up to provide a solid foundation for the new innovations and growth. From Lyve Cloud to scalable storage optimized for enterprise data analytics, Seagate provides trusted solutions. Our experts can offer information technology strategy consulting that helps identify the storage solutions aligned with your IT needs and business goals.\nConnect with a Seagate team member today to learn more about our emerging storage technologies and how they can support continued innovation for your organization.\nMulticloud Maturity Report"

The payment of any future quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagate\u2019s financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe business outlook for the fiscal second quarter 2024 is based on our current assumptions and expectations; actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this release.\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal second quarter 2024:\nGuidance regarding non-GAAP (loss) per share excludes known pre-tax charges related to estimated share-based compensation expenses of $0.14 per share.\nWe have not reconciled our non-GAAP (loss) per share guidance for fiscal second quarter 2024 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, other than estimated share-based compensation expenses, because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net (gain) loss recognized from early redemption of debt, purchase order cancellation fees, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges, income tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP (loss) per share guidance for fiscal second quarter 2024 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.\nInvestor Communications\nSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET that can be accessed on its Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.\nAn archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com shortly following the event conclusion.\nAbout Seagate\nSeagate Technology is the leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage solutions.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user\u2019s overall understanding of the Company\u2019s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company\u2019s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.\nSEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLC\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(In millions,

EBITDA\n143\n178\n221\n256\n798\nThe Company\u2019s Non-GAAP measures are adjusted for the following items:\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\nThese expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures due to the inconsistency in amount and frequency and are excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company\u2019s current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nThe Company records expense from amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations over their estimated useful lives. Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company\u2019s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nBIS settlement penalty\nThe Company accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d), which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nNet loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\nPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nPurchase order cancellation fees\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nRestructuring and other, net\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company\u2019s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nShare-based compensation\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company\u2019s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.\nStrategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance\nOther charges\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt, net gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap, pandemic-related lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600\nshanye.hudson@seagate.com\nMedia Contact:\nGregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092\ngregory.belloni@seagate.com\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231026307326/en/\nMarket Updates\n10 Reasons the Surprise Rally In Japanese Stocks Could Continue\nMarkets Brief: Why Have Bonds Been So Volatile?

The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal third quarter 2024 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.

operations, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user\u2019s overall understanding of the Company\u2019s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company\u2019s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.\nSEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLC\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 29,\n2023\nDecember 30,\n2022\nDecember 29,\n2023\nDecember 30,\n2022\nGAAP Gross Profit\n$\n362\n$\n246\n$\n511\n$\n728\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\n\u2014\n39\n13\n39\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n\u2014\n1\n\u2014\n2\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n7\nPurchase order cancellation fees\n(4\n)\n108\n114\n108\nShare-based compensation\n8\n8\n15\n16\nOther charges\n1\n1\n2\n1\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\n$\n367\n$\n403\n$\n655\n$\n901\nGAAP Gross Margin\n23.3\n%\n13.0\n%\n17.0\n%\n18.6\n%\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\n23.6\n%\n21.4\n%\n21.8\n%\n23.0\n%\nGAAP Operating Expenses\n$\n238\n$\n406\n$\n516\n$\n781\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(22\n)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(3\n)\nRestructuring and other, net\n31\n(81\n)\n29\n(90\n)\nShare-based compensation\n(22\n)\n(25\n)\n(40\n)\n(46\n)\nOther charges\n(7\n)\n(6\n)\n(17\n)\n(12\n)\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses\n$\n240\n$\n294\n$\n488\n$\n608\nGAAP Income (Loss) From Operations\n$\n124\n$\n(160\n)\n$\n(5\n)\n$\n(53\n)\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\n\u2014\n39\n13\n61\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n\u2014\n1\n\u2014\n5\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n7\nPurchase order cancellation fees\n(4\n)\n108\n114\n108\nRestructuring and other, net\n(31\n)\n81\n(29\n)\n90\nShare-based compensation\n30\n33\n55\n62\nOther charges\n8\n7\n19\n13\nNon-GAAP Income From Operations\n$\n127\n$\n109\n$\n167\n$\n293\nGAAP Operating Margin\n8.0\n%\n(8.5\n%)\n(0.2\n%)\n(1.4\n%)\nNon-GAAP Operating Margin\n8.2\n%\n5.8\n%\n5.6\n%\n7.5\n%\nGAAP Net Loss\n$\n(19\n)\n$\n(33\n)\n$\n(203\n)\n$\n(4\n)\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\n\u2014\n39\n13\n61\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n\u2014\n1\n\u2014\n5\nNet gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(104\n)\n\u2014\nNet (gain) loss recognized from early redemption of debt and debt modification costs\n\u2014\n(204\n)\n29\n(204\n)\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n7\nPurchase order cancellation fees\n(4\n)\n108\n114\n108\nRestructuring and other, net\n(31\n)\n81\n(29\n)\n90\nShare-based compensation\n30\n33\n55\n62\nStrategic investment losses or impairment charges\n43\n\u2014\n43\n\u2014\nOther charges\n8\n7\n19\n13\nIncome tax adjustments\n(2\n)\n2\n42\n(3\n)\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\n$\n25\n$\n34\n$\n(21\n)\n$\n135\nGAAP Diluted Net Loss Per Share\n$\n(0.09\n)\n$\n(0.16\n)\n$\n(0.97\n)\n$\n(0.02\n)\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\n\u2014\n0.19\n0.06\n0.29\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n0.02\nNet gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap\n\u2014\n\u2014\n(0.50\n)\n\u2014\nNet (gain) loss recognized from early redemption of debt and debt modification costs\n\u2014\n(0.99\n)\n0.14\n(0.98\n)\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n0.03\nPurchase order cancellation fees\n(0.02\n)\n0.52\n0.55\n0.52\nRestructuring and other, net\n(0.15\n)\n0.39\n(0.14\n)\n0.43\nShare-based compensation\n0.14\n0.16\n0.26\n0.30\nStrategic investment losses or impairment charges\n0.20\n\u2014\n0.21\n\u2014\nOther charges\n0.04\n0.04\n0.09\n0.07\nIncome tax adjustments\n\u2014\n0.01\n0.20\n(0.01\n)\nNon-GAAP Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share1\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.16\n$\n(0.10\n)\n$\n0.65\nShares used in diluted net income (loss) per share calculation\nGAAP\n209\n206\n209\n207\nNon-GAAP\n211\n207\n209\n209\nGAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n169\n$\n251\n$\n296\n$\n496\nAcquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements\n70\n79\n140\n212\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n99\n$\n172\n$\n156\n$\n284\n____________________________________________________________\n1As a result of the net loss reported during the period, GAAP diluted net loss per share for the three months ended December 29, 2023 and December 30, 2022, were computed using weighted average basic shares of 209 million and 206 million, respectively;

Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company\u2019s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nBIS settlement penalty\nThe Company accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d), which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nNet loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\nPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nPurchase order cancellation fees\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nRestructuring and other, net\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company\u2019s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nShare-based compensation\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company\u2019s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.\nStrategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nOther charges\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt, net gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap, pandemic-related lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600\nshanye.hudson@seagate.com\nMedia Contact:\nGregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092\ngregory.belloni@seagate.com\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Additionally, the Company issued $1.5 billion convertible notes due 2028 bearing an interest rate of 3.5% with the proceeds primarily used to retire the outstanding balance on its remaining term loans. As of the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $795 million, and there were 209 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables.\nSeagate has issued a Supplemental Financial Information document, which is available on Seagate\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share, which will be payable on January 9, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2023.

The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP (loss) per share guidance for fiscal second quarter 2024 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.\nInvestor Communications\nSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET that can be accessed on its Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.\nAn archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com shortly following the event conclusion.\nAbout Seagate\nSeagate Technology is the leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage solutions.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user\u2019s overall understanding of the Company\u2019s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.\nThese non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company\u2019s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.\nSEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLC\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(In millions,

EBITDA\n143\n178\n221\n256\n798\nThe Company\u2019s Non-GAAP measures are adjusted for the following items:\nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts\nThese expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures due to the inconsistency in amount and frequency and are excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company\u2019s current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nThe Company records expense from amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations over their estimated useful lives. Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company\u2019s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nBIS settlement penalty\nThe Company accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d), which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nNet loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.\nPandemic-related lockdown charges\nPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nPurchase order cancellation fees\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nRestructuring and other, net\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company\u2019s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nShare-based compensation\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company\u2019s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.\nStrategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance\nOther charges\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods\u2019 operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt, net gain recognized from termination of interest rate swap, pandemic-related lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600\nshanye.hudson@seagate.com\nMedia Contact:\nGregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092\ngregory.belloni@seagate.com\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

As always, following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Dave for his opening remarks.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Shanye, and hello, everyone. I am going to focus on two key topics in my remarks today. First, we delivered solid fiscal second-quarter results with revenue at the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP earnings of $0.12 per share, exceeding the upper end of our guided range. And second, last week, we marked a major inflection point in mass capacity storage with the launch of our groundbreaking Mosaic platform.\nMosaic is intentionally named to describe the fusion of innovative technologies including Seagate's unique implementation of HAMR that collectively enabled us to extend our aerial density leadership. As we shared in the past, growing aerial density is the most efficient way to enable data center operators to scale mass capacity storage to lower their TCO and to advance their sustainability targets. I'll discuss the platform in more detail shortly and also share progress toward qualification and volume ramp of our first HAMR-based Mosaic product. which lays the foundation for products posting five terabytes per disc and beyond.\nLet me start by highlighting our fiscal Q2 performance. Revenue of $1.56 billion was led by sequentially improving cloud nearline demand and a seasonal uptick in consumer drives, offset partially by the decline in VIA sales that we anticipated. Strong cost discipline and execution on pricing adjustments resulted in non-GAAP operating income tripling quarter over quarter and increasing roughly 17% year over year despite lower revenue levels. These performance and demand trends affirm our expectation for the September quarter to be the bottom of this prolonged down cycle.\nThe enhanced discipline we've built into the business, including strict cost controls, management of supply, and the strengthening of our balance sheet gives us an excellent foundation to build on as we move into a broader recovery. Additionally, execution of our product road map is expected to structurally improve profitability and return us to our targeted financial model, which supports healthier industry economics. We enter calendar 2024 with increased confidence in our non-GAAP gross margin trajectory, including our ability to reclaim 30% minimum benchmark level at quarterly revenues that are at least 20% below our prior cyclical peak. From a demand standpoint, gradual recovery within the U.S.\ncloud market has started to take shape, reflecting solid progress in consuming excess inventory, along with more stable end-market behavior. Enterprise OEM demand trends have also stabilized within the U.S. markets. Customer feedback still points to macro-related concerns, although IT hardware budgets are projected to modestly improve in calendar 2024, and traditional server growth is expected to resume trends that support incremental HDD demand growth in the calendar year.\nWe were also encouraged to see incremental demand among certain non-U.S. cloud and enterprise customers in the December quarter. Across the broader China markets, we project a relatively slower pace of recovery given the ongoing economic challenges within the region. However, some local governments announced further steps to support the region's economy, which our customers believe will bolster local demand across mass capacity markets in China in the second half of the calendar year.\nThese efforts support our view for demand in the VIA markets to pick up sometime after the Lunar New Year. Against the dynamic market environment, Seagate has continued to execute on a mass-capacity product portfolio that further advances our technology leadership and serves the breadth of our customers' unique workload requirements while also supporting our objective of improving profitability. I'll outline the execution path for our latest product launches and the relevance of the new platform and then share how we believe our mass capacity solutions deliver economic value both to our customers and to Seagate. Our product qualification and ramp plans are on track with what we've been articulating over the past several quarters.\nWe began shipping initial volumes of our 24-terabyte PMR, 28-terabyte SMR drives in the December quarter. Customer reception has been positive, as illustrated by the numerous active qualifications underway across multiple cloud and enterprise customers. Our three-plus terabyte per disk product is the first major release of the HAMR-based Mozaic platform and we are rapidly nearing qual completion with our initial hyperscale launch partner. The qual has gone very well, and we are working with this customer at their request to fully transition future Seagate demand to the three-plus terabyte per disk platform.\nVolume ramp is starting in the March quarter according to plan with a goal to ship about 1 million units in the first half of this calendar year. We then expect to continue to ramp through the balance of the calendar year, and we are currently broadening our customer engagements. Based on their planned timelines, we expect to complete qualifications with a majority of U.S. hyperscalers and a couple of global cloud customers during calendar 2024.\nStarting at three terabytes per disk, Mozaic delivers a quantum leap forward in aerial density innovation with a well-defined path that extends to five terabytes per disc and beyond. This transformative platform is the culmination of decades of development and numerous technologies pioneered by Seagate, including our superlattice platinum alloy media that enables higher bit density. The revolutionary plasmonic writer with integrated laser capable of reliability writing each bit and an advanced reader technology to post one of the world's smallest reading sensors. While Mozaic represents groundbreaking technology, the platform is fully plug-and-play with existing conventional drives and addresses the breadth of our customers' mass capacity workloads.\nThese drives can also be deployed with SMR technologies for the few customers able to integrate SMR to take advantage of the additional capacity gains. As I noted earlier, aerial density gains are the most efficient way to scale storage capacity. Let me offer a few clear examples. First, as we execute our product road map, we can deliver increasingly higher capacity drives with minimal changes to the bill of materials.\nThis results in a better TCO value proposition for our customers and attractive economics for Seagate. Second, as we scale aerial density to four terabytes per disk, this enables extremely cost-effective product offerings in the low to midrange capacity points used by a majority of our enterprise [Inaudible ] customers. With four terabytes per disk, we used half the number of heads and disks to produce a 20-terabyte drive. Prototypes are already working in our labs with revenue planned for the second half of calendar 2025.\nAs we ramp production to expand to other end markets, we gained tremendous manufacturing efficiencies, adding to the attractive margin opportunities that I just described. We continue to build on our technology and operational innovations with each successive product generation. For example, we are executing plans to vertically integrate the laser manufacturing process, which enhances supply flexibility, provides greater control of the technology, and provides opportunities to lower production costs. Collectively, we believe these actions underpin our mass capacity cost reduction road map while also providing a very strong TCO story for a broad range of customers.\nWhile TCO remains a key driver for mass capacity storage, data center operators are also focused on power and space consumption, particularly as investments in compute-intensive infrastructure proliferates to support generative AI applications. For context, the latest AI GPUs consume up to 700 watts, which is roughly 100x more power intensive than a hard drive operating at maximum performance. Our products can help data center operators store more exabytes using less power and space. To quantify this, a single 32-terabyte Mozaic drive can replace 310-terabyte drives storing more capacity at one-third of the power and footprint.\nTCO and sustainability gains of this magnitude are decision-altering when architecting a new data center and offer a highly economical path to modernizing existing infrastructure. We believe that this dynamic can potentially accelerate the replacement cycle. As we move into the early stages of demand recovery, Seagate's strong focus on maintaining our product and technology road map through this past down cycle position us to return to profitable growth and address data center operators most important challenges cost, power, and space. We believe we've got the right product at the right time, heading into a gradual recovering mass capacity market.\nWith that, Gianluca will now cover details on our financial performance and outlook.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Dave. Seagate's December quarter financial results reflect solid operational execution. Revenue was $1.56 billion, up 7% quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP operating income more than tripled sequentially to $127 million, leading to non-GAAP operating margin expanding to 8.2% of revenue, up 540 basis points quarter over quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.12, improving $0.34 sequentially and exceeding the high end of our original guidance range, reflecting both improving demand trends and our focus on profitability.\nAs these trends continue, we expect our results to improve and reach the target financial model over time. Within our hard disk drive business, exabyte shipments grew 6% sequentially to 95, with revenue growing 7% to $1.4 billion. Revenue performance was mainly driven by an expected improvement in cloud customer demand, along with seasonal improvement in the consumer market. Within the mass capacity market, revenue increased 4% sequentially to $1.1 billion, driven mainly by strong nearline cloud demand, offsetting the expected decline in the VIA market.\nMass capacity shipments totaled 83 exabytes compared with 79 exabytes in the September quarter. Mass capacity shipments as a percent of total HDD exabyte was 87%, which is comparable to the prior quarter 88%. For nearline products, shipment of 65 exabytes were up quarter over quarter from 56 exabytes. Average capacity per nearline drive continue to increase sequentially, reflecting modest demand improvement among both U.S.\ncloud customer and China cloud customers. We believe that inventory among many CSP customers is reaching more normalized levels and anticipate continued nearline demand improvement in the March quarter and beyond. VIA market revenue was down sequentially in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect VIA to reflect more typical seasonal patterns through calendar 2024, with the March quarter representing the low point.\nLegacy product revenue was $324 million, up from $278 million in the prior quarter, driven by higher seasonal demand in the consumer market. We expect the legacy market to be sequentially lower in the March quarter following typical consumer demand trends post holiday season. Finally, revenue for our non-HDD business increased to $171 million compared with $159 million last quarter, primarily driven by improved SSD demand. Moving on to the rest of the income statement.\nNon-GAAP gross profit increased sequentially by roughly $80 million in the December quarter to $367 million, ahead of our original expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.6% expanded nearly 400 basis points compared to the previous quarter due in part to pricing adjustment and cost savings from earlier restructuring activities as well as lower amortization costs, which were about $40 million consistent with our view for ongoing demand recovery. However, we expect underutilization cost to margin increase for the next couple of quarters as we transition some of our production line to Mozaic. Accounting for this headwind, we still expect to see margin expansion every quarter in calendar 2024 as nearline demand continues to improve gradually and we ramp our latest products along with continued execution of price adjustment across the entire portfolio.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $240 million, down from $248 million in the September quarter and reflecting ongoing spending optimization. With the benefit of diligent expense management and higher margins, adjusted EBITDA improved more than 50% sequentially to $216 million. Non-GAAP net income turned positive in the December quarter, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share based on diluted share count of approximately 211 million shares and tax expense of $17 million. Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet.\nIn the December quarter, we had the inventory flat at just below $1.1 billion. Capital expenditure were also flat sequentially at $70 million. A majority of planned capital expenditure were completed in the first half of fiscal '24. Consistent with prior commentary, we still expect fiscal '24 capex to be down significantly compared with fiscal '23, also still sufficient to support our innovation-driven product road map.\nWe generated about $100 million in free cash flow and returned $146 million to shareholders through the quarterly dividend, exiting the quarter with 210 million shares outstanding. We closed the December quarter with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our debt balance was $5.7 billion at the end of December quarter, with more than 90% of our long-term debt obligation beyond three years. Non-GAAP interest expense were flat quarter over quarter at $84 million, and we project similar expense levels in the March quarter.\nTurning to our outlook. We expect incremental improvements in mass capacity demand from both cloud and enterprise customers to more than offset seasonal-related decline in VIA and the legacy markets. With better context, March quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.65 billion, plus or minus $150 million. an increase of 6% sequentially at the midpoint.\nWe are planning for non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $260 million as our temporary pay reduction ended late in the December quarter. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand to the low double-digit percentage range including underutilization cost of approximately $50 million. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be $0.25, plus or minus $0.20, based on a diluted share count of approximately 212 million shares and a non-GAAP tax expense of $27 million. I will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Gianluca. Heading into calendar 2024, we have increased confidence in a gradual nearline demand recovery that coincides with the launch of Mozaic. We believe this platform delivers sustainable aerial density leadership with compelling TCO advantages, enabling data center operators to satisfy their increasing workload demands while conserving both power and space. This combination of capabilities is significant, and our timing is fortuitous.\nWe've navigated the last seven quarters with discipline and focus while maintaining our product and technology execution plans. As a result, we emerge well-positioned to drive optimized financial performance to support our capital return commitments and return to our targeted profitability levels over time. Our strong execution is only possible through the tremendous efforts of our global team, and I would like to thank them for their resiliency and dedication through this dynamic period. I would also like to thank our suppliers, customers, and shareholders for your ongoing support of Seagate.\nOperator, let's open up the call for questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And today's first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with BofA.\nPlease go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you so much. Dave, you alluded to the progress that you've made on Mozaic. Given what you know now, how would you characterize the outlook for maybe HAMR units in the second half of '24 or perhaps into '25? And I think you mentioned your first customer looking to transition to three-terabyte HAMR. What kind of exabyte installed base opportunity is that? And maybe you could address it even more broadly across hyperscalers.\nThat would be very helpful. Thank you.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Wamsi. So, we were very quantitative and prescriptive on the last call about the front half of this year. I think we won't be as much on the back half of this year, but the ramp is continuing on at a healthy pace.\nAnd we're continuing to look at all what customers need on the last-generation platform, next-generation platform, trying to balance supply and demand really well. I think that's the primary metric that we're focused on, make sure we get financial predictability. We'll drive the HAMR transition aggressively this year. And then Mozaic really gets into -- when we get to four terabytes of platter and how are we populating that chain, I mean, we expect to drive as many HAMR exabytes into 2025 as we can.\nSo, we're off to a good start, I think, and we're going up the ramp and trying to work the yields and get everybody qualified like we talked about. Nothing really changed in the last 90 days, I would say, problems are tough problems, but the team is knocking them down. So, I'm pretty happy with that.\nWamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you for that. Gianluca, and maybe could you help us just think about the margin ramp? I think you noted some headwinds that will continue from underutilization charges, but you're also expecting the margins to increase all through calendar '24. Could you maybe also help us think through in that margin commentary, what the margin differential is between HAMR and CMR mass capacity drives and how that might change over time? Thank you so much.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Good question. Well, first of all, our December quarter showed a good improvement in profitability. Our gross margin was up about 4%.\nOperating margin was up more than 5%, so I'll say this profitability recovery already started. Part of that is, of course, coming from a cost actions that we have taken in the last almost two years. And of course, the mix improvement and of course, the pricing action also that we have taken in the last several quarters. So, this will continue to be reflected also in the future quarters.\nMix will continue to go through more mass capacity volume and those cost actions are, of course, continuing to be very effective. In terms of the underutilization defend a little bit what we ramped during the quarter. In the December quarter, we ran a bit more of the wafers, but of course, has high cost in our manufacturing to get ready for the achievement of the current quarter and next quarter in terms of HAMR. And then now we can mediate use it to be the wafer and trend more on the media and, of course, having more driving the final test.\nSo, depending on the base of the mix inside our production. So, we said underutilization charges could be slightly higher, a little bit higher, but not very much higher, which is a little bit higher. So, I expect that for the next few quarters to see mix going in the right direction, meaning more high-capacity drive, and starting to see the impact from some volume of HAMR. So, March will not be particularly high-volume, but we will have more in June.\nAnd as Dave said, we will have even more into the second part of the calendar year. With the business improving, demand improving, we go into possibly higher revenue, and we are, of course, targeting to bring back our gross margin into the target range of 30% to 33%, as we said in the prior quarter, at a much lower level of revenue compared to the prior upside.\nWamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dave, I was wondering if you could just double-click again on some of the dynamics behind the hyperscalers and where their inventory is. How long do you see any more pain or what their behavior is, what your conversations look like? And then again, how they're responding to any pricing actions and production changes that you've been making over the last -- relative to 90 days ago? Thank you.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The dynamics for them is very interesting, and it has affected us quite a bit over the last year or so I do think the inventory situation is much, much better than it was six months ago. So, I'll say, it's basically cleaned up at this point. And it's going into the inventory changes going out and being consumed by the data centers again.\nSo, we're much happier with that. The rate of consumption isn't what it was two years ago. But I do think it's going to accelerate a little bit. And this is where we get into the forecast numbers of what the CAGR is the exabyte CAGR.\nIn 2020, we were in the high 50s and then we stayed in the 30s for 2021 and 2022. And then for the first time ever for the last year, year and a half, we've seen negative exabyte growth, which doesn't make any sense. We're forecasting still in the mid-20s right now. And it may be a little bit higher as people get into some of these replacement cycles that we talked about.\nThe interesting dynamic as I look back on the last year and a half was the push for AI and how it consumed a lot of compute dollars for the compute infrastructure that was going on in the data centers. And that's critical for most of our customers. They have been raised up to get as much compute memory for that compute online as they could to be able to handle all these AI applications everyone's talking about. I do think ultimately, there's a data back-end piece of that.\nAnd then also, there's the fact that they were -- as they were prioritizing that, they were letting the drives that they had in the data centers just continue to run. So, there's the replacement cycle for power and space and just overall cost benefits. We're all -- we're definitely having those conversations with our customers. And then factoring that into what exactly our volume plans are for the next three years and saying this is what we're intending to build.\nThis is the economics that you could get it to -- and we've talked about this build-to-order before, and I think we're getting a lot of good reception is. There's a lot of other supply chains that are actually managed this way by these people. So, they understand it fairly well, and they see the TCO benefits of the higher capacity drives, so they want to reach for that, plan it well and they'll get it. And we have to be careful, of course, because the factories have been so decimated by this downturn that we need to make sure that as we grow back, we go back in a smart way.\nErik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSuper. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator\nAnd our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to maybe just ask about the income statement, just the P&L trajectory from here. This guidance that you've given, looks like it's the first kind of sequential increase in opex that we've seen, and I can appreciate improving fundamentals, etc.\nI'm just curious, how do we think about the pace of quarterly opex and maybe a normalized level of operating expenses looking out over a couple of quarters? And then kind of building off of that with free cash flow generation returning -- just remind us again how you think about the capital structure and possibility of coming back into the market in terms of share repo? Thank you.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Aaron. Well, in terms of opex, if you look at -- our trend has always been very positive in terms of opex control, cost control. Just a few quarters ago, we were at well above $300 million. So, we went fairly low, especially in the last quarter, now at $240 million.\nAs I said in the prepared remarks, we have a little bit of higher costs expected in this quarter because we took some extraordinary action on salary that ended at the end of last quarter. So, we have a little bit of higher labor cost. As usual, we will focus on opex control is still a very, very good number. And I think in the next few quarters, we will stay around this level of opex until next fiscal year, as you know, in the current fiscal year, we don't have any variable compensation overall in our COGS and opex, but a big part is in opex.\nSo, I think this level is probably reasonable for fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. And then next fiscal year, probably a little bit higher cost in opex. Still, I think well below the $300 million, probably between $270 million to $80 million a quarter is probably a reasonable way to model it. Free cash flow, we had another positive free cash flow quarter.\nOf course, always very important for us to generate positive free cash flow. Revenue is increasing, profitability is increasing and therefore, we expect free cash flow also to improve sequentially through the next few quarters.\nAaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nUnknown speaker\nHey, guys. This is Eddie for Krish. Congrats on the HAMR launch. It's an exciting opportunity for you guys I have a question regarding the customer value you are providing with these two-terabyte HAMR drives.\nWill customers be enjoying lower price for terabyte versus 22 and 24 terabytes CMR drives, for example, or because HAMR yields haven't matured yet, this benefit will be more about power and space and the lower price per terabyte to take place in the future?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, it's a good question. We will balance everything, of course, what our yields are and our costs are, and try to get the customers incentivized, but there is some incentive business provided by their power and space reductions as well. We call that their TCO proposition.\nSo, all things in balance. I do think that the price per terabyte, if you will, is nominally the same. It may be just slightly lower, but there's definitely going to be a TCO incentive for the customers to move off of the lower capacities and onto higher.\nUnknown speaker\nThat's great color. Thanks, Dave. And if we just suppose the HAMR transition to the transition from LMR to PMR that took place back in 2006, 2008 you guys went from like 0% PMR mix to 100% within five to six scores. Do you think the HAMR transition will be as quick, or you see some reasons why this ramp may be a little bit slower transition from LMR to PMR back then?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nCycle times are a little bit longer now. So, I don't think it will be as fast. I mean, I'd like it to be as fast and we'll continue to drive it as quick as we possibly can. The one thing I will say is that our last generation PMR product, if you will, the 2.4 terabytes per platter drive that we've just talked about has a remarkably similar kit of parts as the HAMR drives do.\nSo, relative to what we're making one versus the other, it's not a big deal and we can get through customer transitions easier. I think as we gain more confidence in a year over the four-plus terabyte Mozaic platforms, then we'll definitely want to accelerate. Because by the time you get to say, five-plus terabytes, then it's such a great replacement on every legacy product that you have that we want to drive the whole portfolio there because utilization is much better in the factories and the costs come way down.\nUnknown speaker\nThank you, Dave.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nThomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. So, I just wanted to understand the move from qualification to revenue recognition.\nIt sounds like with your largest customer, you're finishing qualification right now and you're obviously pointing to some big units in the first half. You mentioned on the call that you're expecting calls with the majority of the U.S. cloud and a couple of others in calendar year '24. Would you expect a similar time frame between qualification and revenue recognition? Like if those are getting qualified in the second half of this year, you could see revenue from a large number of additional customers.\nJust wanted to understand the timing.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Tom. It's complex. There are some customers that are relatively shorter qualifications and that -- some of that's because of feature set, making sure we get the feature set checked out. If they're on a generic feature set that we're already shipping versus their own unique feature set we have to -- we have to make sure we're doing all those things, right? That's normal in any nearline transition.\nAnd I will say that a lot of people are seeing the TCO benefits. So, they're asking and trying to speed these qualifications through, right, because they want that benefit to flow through as well. We will also be limited on our ramp as to what we can do, and the cycle times are quite long. So, we're going to balance all these things together, if that helps you.\nThomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nYeah, that's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one on the margin side. So, you guys have talked about 20% below peak but still getting back to that 30% gross margin target or at least at the low end. If you look at what you're saying for mass capacity growth for the industry, mid-20s if you just assigned that to kind of your revenue ramp over the next couple of years, it takes probably a year and a half to kind of get to that $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion mark, just using like a linear growth rate.\nIs that the time frame we should be thinking about until you get back to that 30% to 32% gross margin? Or can you get there before? And what are the levers that get you there before revenue gets back to that $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion? Thank you.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Tom. Well, the major lever is HAMR. The more we ramp up HAMR, better will be the margin. So, we are becoming more and more positive on, of course, the timing of that continuous improvement in our margin.\nI would say we gave an indication last quarter in terms of the level of revenue. But we think we need to achieve in order to get a certain level of gross margin. That is probably I'm getting a little bit more optimistic right now. So, probably we can do an even lower level of revenue.\nAs you said before, qualification of customers is important, but we are working hard on qualifying more and more customers. So, assuming we can continue our ramp on him. Now, I'm fairly positive we can do earlier than what you said and also at the lower level of revenue.\nThomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nThank you. Gianluca, it's encouraging to see an improving gross margin trajectory, but it doesn't appear to be driven by price yet. Given our mass capacity suggests that price per terabyte did fall low single digits sequentially and year over year. Could you perhaps address whether we should expect previous actions to raise prices across the channel may occur over the next couple of quarters? I have a follow-up, please.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Karl. Well, I would say you can see the good improvement in our profitability. A good part of that is actually coming from pricing. Of course, you need to check into the like-for-like pricing.\nThe mix has, of course, always a major impact on the average. We are very happy with what we are doing, both on pricing and on cost. This quarter show a fantastic improvement in profitability, both gross margin and operating margin. And if you look at our guidance, this imply another strong improvement in profitability.\nSo, Pricing is a good part of that. Mix is another part of that improvement. And we will continue to do exactly execute a strategy, and we are really we are very glad with the outcome so far.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would say, Karl, the raw demand is still not what it was two years ago. And we have a supply chain that's not entirely healthy yet. We have to go continue to work on those actions.\nBut I do think over time, especially incentivizing transitions to newer mass capacity drives. And then if there's price raises, it tends to be more on legacy and to the extent that everyone is under the same strain throughout the entire ecosystem, this is the trend that we're seeing, I think we'll probably take advantage of it. My sense is that in the next year or two, we'll get to the point where we get high enough of the ramp that we can be very predictable. And then I think things will stabilize quite a bit.\nBut we're not at a place where the industry has enough demand relative to the capacity that has online yet.\nKarl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nVery clear. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. You implemented a build-to-order program with your customers. Can you give an update on that? Is that still active? And how is it giving you visibility?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Thanks very much. It is, and it's transitioned from my last comments as well because the industry just at the levels that we're at, to build on my last comment is just can't fund the investment disease make an aerial density and exabyte growth over time with the revenue and margins where it was and what helps us is to run factories is the improved visibility and the predictability toward that in demand. And so, I think that's why the HDD industry has changed fairly dramatically through this cycle, the last six or eight quarters because capacity did come at the same time that people were that demand was down.\nAnd the industry is, therefore, underinvested in capital, and lead times are going up, as we've talked about before. So, we need this build-to-order framework to just get back to a healthy industry. And we are rewarding predictability with our customers, and we're incentivizing that predictability and where the people aren't predictable, and they come in at the last minute for product that either we don't have it or they have to pay for our flexibility. I think that's the way we're thinking about it and then making sure that we stabilize the supply base as well because it's not just ourselves as the HDD supplier, but we have numerous upstream supplies that need to be stabilized as well.\nSo, it's still going to take some time.\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And you mentioned vertical integration of your laser technology. Is that a cost savings? Or is it more controlling the supply chain?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I think at this point, it's been a long time coming, and we definitely value the suppliers that have helped us get HAMR products to market. We also feel like given how intricate this silicon photonic circuitry is, is that we needed our own capability to control but right now, it's more of a technology second sourcing, if you will. And so, we're going to continue to run with a few sources.\nI think over time, there should be the opportunity to go drive the cost down and balance all things with multiple sources and the ability to control the investments that we make in capital, for example, and things like that. But it's been a long time coming and part of the reason we're talking about it as part of Mozaic because it's very relevant as we get the four-terabyte platter and five-terabyte platter I think also there's been some noise out there in the industry about, well, as goes the ramp of that supplier so goes the Seagate ramp, and that's clearly not true.\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question today comes from Steven Bryant Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC. Please go ahead.\nSteven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. Dave, I was just wondering if you could zoom out a little bit without putting any kind of time frame on it, to get to the 30% gross margins, it seems like you can almost get there from here on just the typical incremental margins from volumes. But based on everything you said, it doesn't seem that easy, especially early stage with HAMR versus later stage. So, can you sort of walk through some of the puts and takes, say, over the next two to three quarters versus, say, when you hit that volume crossover where it becomes more smooth to get to the margin? It's just -- there's been a lot of comments around this.\nMaybe you could just sum it up.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And Gianluca can share some insights as well here. I think that, first of all, we're ramping HAMR according to some prescriptive schedule. We can deploy it into certain mass-capacity hyperscaler markets.\nWe can also deploy it in other markets, depending on how we choose to do things so we can put it in VIA markets, for example, over time. And the rate at which we are able to transition and our yields and scrap and things like that, especially once we get to four terabytes per platter, then I think that becomes more and more accretive in margin. Fundamentally, though, I still think the demand picture actually is going to shape the next few quarters from a margin perspective. My sense is the demand has still not come anywhere close to where it was two years ago.\nWe may see with the growth of data and with investments that people need to make in data around all these AI applications, we may see demand pick back up again, and that will be the fundamental driver. Gianluca, go ahead.\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, I said that before. I think the combination of stronger demand through the cycle and our very good products based on HAMR technology. will drive further improvement in gross margin, sequential improvement.\nNow, I think we will have a sequential improvement through the entire kind of '24. And this is, of course, based on our view of the ramp of HAMR and also the recovery from the prior down cycle that we expect, especially in the mass capacity to continue through the entire kind of '24 and actually even kind of '25 in it.\nSteven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Can you fill in one other blank, which is back-end testing capacity? How does that sort of help hurt margins as this ramp happens? Thanks.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nBased on where we were from legacy products years ago on desktop and so on and even just the volumes we were at a couple of years ago, I think we have plenty of back-end test capacity.\nSteven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst\nBut is it a longer test cycle, though? Isn't it a longer test cycle?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt is. It certainly is. The bigger the drive, the longer the test cycle, but we still have plenty of capacity to cover the demands at this level.\nSteven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst\nAwesome. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnknown speaker\nThis is Maia on for Tim. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. Now, you don't report orders, but perhaps you could give us some color on book-to-bill and just some idea of where orders are relative to revenues and where that -- how that book-to-bill has been trending and where you think that's going over the next couple of quarters, that would be helpful.\nThanks.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. That does get into our build-to-order plans. We are definitely, like I said before, very prescriptive on what we're building for people two, three, four quarters out. And as long as we all stay on that plan, I think that's predictable economics for our customers as well.\nSo, it's going better and better every quarter. I think when we first launched this, there was questions that I was getting on these earnings calls about supply is so far below or sorry, since demand is so far below supply today, how can you do something like this, but we need that predictability in order to run the supply chain and reward everyone upstream of the supply chain. So, far, the progress has been fairly good, and we're getting better visibility in the next quarter and beyond.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nYeah. Dave, just on the enterprise hard disk drive side on the hardest asset, do you see, given the 25% exabyte growth and recovery on the TC side this year, do you expect those revenues to get back to that $2 billion run rate exiting '24, I guess, calendar '24?\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nNo, we don't guide after this quarter. So, we just gave a good guidance for the March quarter in terms of revenue increase and profitability increase. And as we said, no, we are ramping here volume. We are seeing better demand environment.\nSo, we expect sequential improvement through the quarter, but we don't give specific guidance on revenue for the end of the calendar year.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would say that, obviously, we're watching nearline demand, CSP demand, on-prem enterprise demand continuing to build strength but not nearly be as big as it was a couple of years ago, but that's very good, and we're being very careful building into it. The one point that you just raised, which was the whole AI TPC demand, which I think it's still very early innings in this, but we do see opportunity there. high-end workstations, if you will, that are running AI applications may actually be an interesting opportunity.\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. And then on the gross margin line, sorry to belabor that, do you see you guys getting back to that target window 33% exiting this year? And especially on the HAMR side, I think Dave mentioned you can do with four-terabyte plus five disks or a 20-terabyte drive versus seven to 10 disks now. What are the gross margins on HAMR versus where you see your corporate margins today, I guess?\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We know we said in the past amortized gross margin is, for sure, accretive to the corporation. So, it's always above our average. Right now, as you know, there is no HAMR drive in our results.\nBut now we see starting in the March quarter, and you already see some improvement in our guidance. It will be -- I expect more when we go into the June quarter and through the rest of the calendar year. So, we are positive on the profitability from that product. And we need to take our time to qualify big customers and then to start ramp because, as Dave said, we take a little bit of time to rent high-volume production for the new product.\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nYeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Really appreciate it.\nI guess for Dave, and Gianluca can jump in here, too. The hyperscalers are sort of having some conversation about data center redesign over the coming years, a lot of this is around GPU compute. But they are referring to it as data center redesign more generally and broadly. And I guess would there -- if that occurs, do you have any opinion on if there would be incremental opportunity for nearline drive that would, I guess, substantively be like in addition to whatever data growth is going on? So, I just wanted any thoughts on that in any context.\nAnd that's it. Thanks.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Ananda, it's a real complex topic. What I would say is that the compute infrastructure is changing dramatically, and the memory architectures will change to support that computer architecture very dramatically as well. So, there is a lot of redesign discussion going on.\nthere are different types of applications and things that are being branded AI, there's stuff that's very focused on text or large language models. And then there's image recognition and video creation. And so, there's a lot of different types of applications that are propagating. And I think this is just normal application development that's been going on for years and years and years.\nBut I do think there's different types of hardware. So, I think there are some now AI data centers being discussed that are largely compute. I also think that some of these applications are spinning off a lot of data and they're requiring data to be stored for a certain period of time and then brought back up to the higher levels to be reprocessed. And so, that's just normal data growth as well.\nSo, I think the net of it is there's a lot of architectural redesign going on, probably not affecting the tiers that we're in. If anything, and we made reference to this in the prepared remarks, there's cost power and space or at a premium. There's many AI applications from what I'm hearing that there's just not enough power for and our infrastructure is going to be critical. But to the extent that you can do your part to buy transitioning to higher capacity drives that net-net gives you the same exabyte capacity with less power.\nI think that's a good thing. It may be an opportunity for us.\nAnanda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nSo, that would be in addition to like the 25% kind of data run rate driven -- that sort of power is a catalyst, Dave?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's hard to say. It depends on the bills and how much people are having to pay for it. Again, I think in the AI applications that are really exploding right now, power is going to become one of the limiting factors. And so, to the extent that there may be a really good payoff in not only cost savings, space savings, and so on but also just freeing up that power infrastructure to go to other things.\nI mean, that might actually help us get above the 25%.\nAnanda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Mark Miller of the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you for the question, and congratulations on the launch of Mozaic. I'm just wondering, you mentioned it briefly. What kind of traction are you seeing from AI-related opportunities? And what do you -- how do you see that ramping throughout the year?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Mark, me, I'm pretty cynical sometimes on these things, and I'm looking for POs that actually say AI on them. And they are starting to happen, but it's still fairly small. And again, I'll go back to my previous comments, these are really applications that have been developing on a lot of fronts over many years anyway.\nSo, say, for example, image recognition, whether it's at the edge or in the cloud, that application space has been developing over time quite a bit. When we get into specific things like large language models where people talk about, I think the data infrastructure impact piece is still secondary to the compute piece even at this point. So, at some point, there will be compute enabling all these really cool applications and efficiencies that people and businesses like ours were taking advantage of and then the data will continue to grow on the back side of that, but we're still early innings on that.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nSo, that's more 2025, you think?\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nFor large language models, I'd say maybe. I don't know exactly.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Marco. Seagate is focused on executing our product road map, leveraging the advanced technologies in our Mozaic platform, which we believe positions us well to enhance profitability over the near term and capture long-term opportunities for mass capacity storage. I'd like to close by, once again, thanking all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support of Seagate. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you during the quarter.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nShanye Hudson -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury\nDave Mosley -- Chief Executive Officer\nGianluca Romano -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nErik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\nUnknown speaker\nThomas OMalley -- Barclays -- Analyst\nKarl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst\nKevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst\nSteven Bryant Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nAnanda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nMore STX analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.
