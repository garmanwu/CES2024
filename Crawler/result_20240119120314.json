        "raw_content": "CES 2024: AI, electric vehicles and sustainability take center stage\nAfter another whirlwind week of tech innovation, these are the top trends sure to dominate the year ahead.\n\u201cI think the biggest challenge with CES is come out of it feeling focused,\u201d said Andy Hart, CEO of SBD Automotive.\nGiven that a crowd of over 130,000 jostled their way through 4,000 exhibitors at last week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, this feels both understandable, as well as an understatement.\nHart was speaking to HERE about the cutting-edge technology we can expect to make an impact in 2024. And if, like most of the world, you are transfixed by artificial intelligence (AI), there was no shortage of examples of how AI will impact our daily lives, especially when it comes to getting from A to B.\nRead more \u2014 Mercedes-Benz VP Automated Driving: Cars are more complex than airplanes\nAI in high gear\nBy now, asking Alexa to play you a song, or requesting today\u2019s weather from Siri feels completely natural \u2014 although far from a proper conversation. But thanks to Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, having a conflab with your car will soon be commonplace.\nBoth companies have integrated ChatGPT into their voice assistants with vehicle-specific information, which means that not only will you be able to ask if it is likely to rain while you\u2019re on the road, but also how in the world you open up the trunk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion of the use of AI and how it can transform the way businesses operate, as well as how it can improve the end-customer experience,\u201d said HERE CCO Jason Jameson. \u201cThe good news is that HERE has a pretty strong AI story. We use AI extensively with the way HERE UniMap ingests millions of map updates a day.\u201d\nRead more \u2014 CES 2024: HERE and Uber join forces to enhance precise mapping\nElectric ambitions\nFrom Honda\u2019s DeLorean-esque Zero Saloon to Kia\u2019s modular fleet of vans, there was no denying that all forms of electric transportation were the stars of this year\u2019s show (there was even a self-driving electric baby stroller).\nIt was also announced that the Lotus Emeya Hyper-GT, one of the most exciting new electric vehicles (EVs) hitting our streets in 2024, will follow in the Lotus Eletre\u2019s tire treads and come fully equipped with\u00a0HERE Navigation\u2019s EV Range Assistant package, including charge point POI search, multi-stop routing, range-on-map, and range-on-route \u2014 all capable of being updated over-the-air.\nHERE also plans to launch HERE EV Range Factors\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0aimed at reducing driver range anxiety with improved on-route battery range calculations \u2014 by the middle of this year.\nRead more: Will green hydrogen replace electric vehicle technology?\nSustainability first\nWith 2023 officially confirmed as the warmest on record, it was not a surprise that green tech was heavily talked about on the CES floor.\nHydrogen made a surprise clean energy comeback as Hyundai outlined plans to make the alternative fuel a significant part of its renewable development strategy.\nMeanwhile, trucking startup Nikola debuted its first US-built hydrogen truck and Bosch Mobility unveiled its new hydrogen combustion engine. The latter also announced their collaboration with\u00a0HERE and Daimler Truck AG on an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) technology for commercial vehicles that automatically determines the most efficient driving style, helping to reduce driver stress, energy consumption, and CO2\u00a0emissions.\nAdditionally, HERE introduced HERE\u00a0Advanced Traffic Patterns,\u00a0a solution aimed at enhancing estimated time of arrival (ETA) accuracy, crucial for efficient and sustainable transportation operations.\nNotably, initial testing in Germany indicates up to a 15-minute improvement in ETA accuracy for heavy trucks over a 100km highway segment, highlighting its potential impact on long-distance hauls.\n\u201cThe challenge in some ways is leaving CES knowing not just what are the big trends but also what you don't need to focus on as you go back to your teams and how it all connects back to your own strategy, your own vision,\u201d said SBD Automotive\u2019s Hart.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s tricky because it\u2019s so big. So many exhibitors, so many people. It\u2019s tough but that\u2019s a big reason why we come to the show.\u201d\nLouis Boroditsky\nManaging Editor, HERE360\nLouis Boroditsky\nManaging Editor, HERE360\nHERE UniMap\nCES 2024: AI, electric vehicles and sustainability take center stage\nHERE named #1 location platform by Counterpoint\nCES 2024: diving into the world's biggest tech show\nSign up for our newsletter\nWhy sign up:\nHERE"
