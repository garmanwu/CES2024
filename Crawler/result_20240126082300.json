        "raw_content": "CES 2024: The 30 Best Things We Saw at the Consumer Electronics Show\nCES 2024: The 30 Best Things We Saw at the Consumer Electronics Show\nBy\nSage Anderson\nSage Anderson\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\nThe Best of\nCES 2024\n\u201cAI\u201d was undeniably the name of the game at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronic\u2019s Show in Las Vegas. While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful. Variety is key here, and depending on how beefed up your audio system is, it can drive to most speakers or headphones, or integrate into an existing hi-fi system (there\u2019s a new HDMI ARC port, too, in case you want to hook it up to a TV).\nIt\u2019s also easy on the eyes, with a 6-inch FHD display and delightfully tactile knobs that make interacting with the R9 a dream.\u00a0Just add speakers, and the FiiO R9 will be music to your ears.\nBuy on FiiO for $1,499\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nChina-based tech startup Xreal joined the wearable AR race this year, creating smart glasses fit to give the Apple Vision Pro some stiff competition. They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here.

More so, last July NOUHAUS held a LUNA (recliner massage chair) launch party in Barbie Penthouse located in Beverly Hills and opened a pop-up space during the \"Annual Block Party\" in L.A. The invited guests \u2013 Hollywood celebrities, influencers, and many other esteemed guests altogether exalted NOUHAUS massage chairs for their incomparable qualities.\nNouhaus LUNA launch party in Barbie Penthouse, Beverly Hills L.A. California\nMassage chairs may not be a commonly bought furniture in the U.S., yet many experts' outlook is that with the market-leading experiences, significant design, and innovative technology, NOUHAUS is ready to take on the massage chair market in America as well.\nHaving successfully showcased their products at the recent CES show, from Jan. 9 to 12 in Las Vegas, Nevada, NOUHAUS unveiled ORBIT, its newly launched premium massage chair to the public.\nORBIT is the first premium massage chair with exquisite speakers that presents quality relaxation with personalized dynamic massage and modern design expressed through artistic linear edges. It has won the honor in the Red Dot Design Award 2022 and K Design Award 2023, certifying the brilliance in both design and function.\nThe chair is equipped with the finest quality speakers designed and directed by Prof. Kukil Yu, also known as the \"maestro\" of tuning sounds. Prof. Yu is renowned as the most experienced expert regarding sound and speakers in Korea and sustains collaboration with 'Accuton' He has not only won over 130 global awards including the Red Dot Design Award, IF Design Award, but also has been recognized as the best amongst all entries in over 100 projects.\nFor the ORBIT, he designed two convertible modes \u2013 Normal Mode and Speaker Mode which are controlled with an APP. At default, the speaker is adjusted to deliver the most optimal sound for the person seated. The sound orbits around the user, leading them to their personal concert hall. At Speaker Mode, the speaker amplifies and diffuses sound, perfect for users when doing other activities while still listening to their favorite music.\nAlso, NOUHAUS collaborated with 'Sound Vaccine', a company with Digital hearing loss treatment technology, to equip ORBIT with another significant function, TSC (Threshold Sound Conditioning) which helps improve the hearing. This technology, developed by neuroscientists at Stanford School of Medicine over four years, has been certified for its safety and effectiveness by SCIE-level international academic journals in 2020.\nFurthermore, the ergonomically designed massage chair recognizes the user and adjusts the shoulder height for perfectly customized comfort. Users can choose from 14 different dynamic and refreshing massage functions to relieve stress on a daily basis.\nThe CES event provided NOUHAUS with a significant opportunity to showcase the technological advancements of ORBIT and its other product lines, including best-sellers and accessories. Detailed information about the ORBIT and its innovative features was revealed to the public, further solidifying NOUHAUS's reputation for quality and innovation in the furniture industry. The NOUHAUS booth, located at Tech West, Venetian Expo, Level 2 (booth number 54753), attracted considerable attention and was a highlight of the show.\nMedia Contact\nCompany: NOUHAUS\nContact: Taek KIM\nEmail: sk.shim@nouhaus.co.kr\nWebsite: http://nouhausglobal.com\nSOURCE: NOUHAUS\nFeatured\nTrending"
