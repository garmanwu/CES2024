The PCB design files can be printed within minutes and are ready for manufacturing.\nThe Demo: PrintStator Motor CAD\u00a0Platform\nDuring the call with Machine Design, Bright and three colleagues demonstrated how they could design a custom PCB motor within minutes. For the live demo, Lauren Donald, lead software engineer, ECM, focused on two aspects: the motor catalog and the custom design flow.\nREAD MORE:\u00a0R&D Spotlight: PCB Stator Technology Replaces Bulky Copper Windings\nAfter signing in to the PrintStator motor CAD program, the design engineer can plug in constraints for the specific motor they\u2019re looking to design. Donald keyed in basic parameters for a 3hp or 2.2kW motor. The algorithm proceeded to scan for the closest match based on 8,000 designs in the database.\nThe platform provided the five closest matches to the specifications, including detailed parameters for high efficiency, border radius, diameter, current and voltage estimates.\nRyan Duffy, lead applications engineer, ECM, explained that the engineer can further filter the specifications and constraints to optimize for the desired custom motor design. Common constraints may include increasing or decreasing the voltage, optimal specs for the fan, the target efficiency, the radius and a custom design flow.\nThe user can also create a custom motor from scratch. In a custom build, the user will populate fields for speed, torque, power and size, said Duffy. Based on these and other custom parameters, the platform will default efficiency to 80% (advanced users may access advanced settings) and will prompt the user to answer queries provided by ECM\u2019s team. This exchange of information is helpful in triggering considerations the user might have overlooked, and extends the platform\u2019s flexibility, explained Duffy.\nInvariably, the design engineer may have assumptions and external calculations that can be tested on the platform. During the demo, Duffy compared different magnet grades (such as Neodymium, ceramic, or Samarian cobalt magnets) that are typically used in motors, analyzing the performance differences.\nThe user can further set the number of motor poles, the PCB layer count or PCB thickness, as well as how thick the magnets should be. In addition, the user can select bearing properties, the shaft and the rotating assembly. \u201cIdeally, you want to keep the bounds large enough to allow the optimizer to find the best solution within that space,\u201d advised Duffy.\nOnce satisfied with the theoretical configuration, the user will optimize the design with thermal constraints, before generating the design and sending it to the next phase for evaluation and setting it up for manufacturing.\nREAD MORE: ECM PCB Stator Technology Offers Next-Gen Pump Solution\n\u201cI can go to the next design phase and start adding some central manufacturing constraints,\u201d said Duffy. \u201cDepending on the complexity of the design, a design can be ready in five to 25 min., depending on how many constraints are applied and how complex the problem is.\u201d\nMotor Design Tool Enables Rapid Production\nECM has to date built prototypes for a range of manufacturing industry partners, ranging from HVAC, consumer electronics, medical, robotics, renewable energy, aerospace, defense, e-mobility and fitness, according to James McMullan, who handles the company\u2019s operations in Europe.\nBright said the PCB Stator innovation\u00a0and PrintStator Motor CAD\u00a0platform is a differentiator, as it shifts the design process away from off-the-shelf options. \u201cAnyone, from startup entrepreneur to big company engineer, can use PrintStator for fully customized motor design.\u201d\nBright counts among PCB Stator technology\u2019s advantages the fact that they are smaller, quieter and more energy and space efficient across a broad range of use cases. The PCB Stators achieve \u201cefficiencies in the mid-90s and require just 20% of the raw materials,\u201d noted the company\u2019s website.\nMachine Design reported last year on how ECM\u2019s PCB stators replace the bulky copper windings of conventional motors with a thin disc design. The PrintStator designed mortors incorporating ECM PCB Stators are smaller, 70% lighter, require less materials and can reach efficiencies in excess of 90%.\nREAD MORE: Moving Motors Stretch the Possibilities of Long-Travel Motion\nECM is a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree and winner of four International SaaS Awards\u2014including SaaS Solution of the Year; Best SaaS Product for CSR, Sustainability and ESG; and Best SaaS Product for Engineering Management, PLM or CAD.\nECM\u2019s PrintStator software is also a Machine Design IDEA Awards winner.\nContinue Reading\nMining for Answers: Tapping into the Product Data with Software & Systems\nBrushed vs Brushless Motors:\nWhich is Best for your Application?\nSponsored Recommendations\nPumps for Medical Equipment\nFrom Observing Bubbles to Helium Leak Testing \u2013 An Overview of Pump Leakage Testing Methods\nWhat Exactly Is Leakage?

What it is designed to do is often quite different from how it turns or grinds or drills, or does whatever machining process it performs.\nAn electrical or mechanical engineer will know that a CNC machine works because within its cabinet there are a series of a high-powered, high-precision electric motors. Asking how that electric motor works begins a tale that may become more compelling if the developers at ECM PCB Stator Technology continue to reframe the discussion. ECM is a U.S.-based startup that uses patented PCB Stator technology to design custom motors for multiple electric applications.\nA \u201cstator\u201d is a stationary component of a rotary motor; when the stator is energized via a DC supply \u2013 and through the motor\u2019s controller \u2013 it spins the motor shaft to add a specific speed and torque that powers the machine.\nNote, the typical stator is made of multiple coils of wire, in a structure that is scaled to the power output of the engine it serves. It generates heat and endures stress as the motor runs. It\u2019s a critical subsystem in the machining process.\nThe ECM PCB Stator Technology innovation is to replace the copper windings found in conventional electric motors with a much lighter, printed circuit board \u2013 the method widely used by engineers to link individual components of electrical systems.\nECM\u2019s development makes the PCB stator the central component for harnessing electric energy efficiently, to create a highly predictable magnetic field that generates the precise torque and horsepower required at the motor shaft, within a fully integrated rotor magnet assembly optimized for specified end use applications.\nAlso, ECM\u2019s PrintStator software platform \u2013 a recent beta release \u2013 makes it possible to quickly design, model, and prototype optimized PCB stator electric motors that are lighter, faster, quieter, and\nmore energy-efficient and space-conserving\nthan the bulky and \u201cdesign-constrained\u201d electric motors still widely used.\nBoth developments are traced to research by ECM\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, well-known electrical engineer Dr. Steven Shaw, who received his Ph.D. from MIT.\nIn 2022, the start-up business has designed over 70 \u201cuniquely optimized electric motors,\u201d working with 34 partners and a SaaS offering for designing new installations.\n\u201cThe breadth of ECM\u2019s partners and range of use cases actually gets to the crux of our mission and most recent big move: the beta release of PrintStator in fourth-quarter 2022,\u201d said Rob Luchars, vice president, Business Development. He explained that the firm\u2019s patented PCB Stators have been adopted for \u201cbespoke, axial flux electric motors\u201d powering applications in a range of industries, including HVAC, consumer electronics, e-mobility, medical devices, robotics, aerospace, defense, and many others. The potential for powering computer-numerical control (CNC) processes \u2013 more power in a smaller package that is more precisely customizable \u2013 is surely promising.\n\u201cThere are millions of applications that require electric motors in these verticals and PCB Stator electric motor design technology offers benefits to all those applications, in performance, efficiency, and sustainability over other electric motor alternatives,\u201d Luchars reported.\nEnergy costs and liabilities are looming concerns for manufacturers, so they will be encouraged to note that the PCB Stator technology and PrintStator software can create electric motor designs that require significantly less raw materials in production, making the per-unit cost very competitive. Luchars added that ECM-designed motors can achieve energy efficiencies in the mid-90s range \u2013 \u201ca huge jump compared to other motor technologies.\u201d\nOne of the greatest consumption and cost improvements with PCB Stator technology (versus standard stator design) is the ability to design a perfect fit motor for the application \u2014 in both specs and dimensions \u2014 which drastically increases the system efficiency of electric systems.\nThere are maintenance considerations, too. PCB Stator motors are much more reliable than alternative motor technologies because the copper is encapsulated in standard PCB material (FR4), which prevents insulation failures, the leading cause of motor malfunction.\nThe cost to install an ECM PCB Stator motor varies according to the application, and what system it is meant to replace. Luchars explained that a critical advantage of the new option is that it\u2019s software-based, \u201cso we can quickly project the cost of a motor for any application and quantify the competitive advantages precisely.\n\u201cECM can also take exact specifications from our partners for any application and model that is in PrintStator before going to prototype,\u201d he added. \u201cThat way we can more quickly and accurately assess product fit (case by case), and achieve more accuracy and fewer failures when a design goes forward to production.\u201d\nHow about the earlier proposition\u2026 Powering CNC machines? Luchars indicated that to-date there are just a few such examples, and the company views CNC systems as \u201cripe\u201d for PCB stator motors. He revealed that ECM is \u201cin dialogue in several directions to lead there.\"\n\u201cPCB stator motors have been used in a wide variety of high-precision and high-torque applications that lend themselves very well to the CNC industry. PCB Stator technology can power CNC-design machines and then, of course, be integrated into electric motors systems for outputs of CNC design,\u201d he detailed.\nAs of now, ECM\u2019s primary focus is design for electric motors rated at 20 kW or under, though Luchars revealed that the company is increasing its scope beyond that range, and expects to expand in that direction shortly.\nThe potential for designing CNC machines powered by motors developed with PCB Stator technology is \u201ctremendous,\u201d he explained. Luchars highlighted three primary reasons.\n\u201cFirst, due to their axial flux configuration, utilization of PCB stators with rotary axis tables \u2014 either vertical or horizontal \u2014 provide benefits of overall \u2018height/stick out,\u2019 reduction along with lower overall weight.\n\u201cAdditionally, PCB Stators lend themselves to hollow shaft configurations that are ideal for a variety of CNC applications,\u201d he said. \u201cAside from the conventional 40-taper machines, PCB Stator motors can also be beneficial in micro-machining applications \u2013 where positional accuracy is paramount \u2013 due to the zero-cogging torque of PCB Stator motors and where managing thermal expansion is key.\n\u201cFinally, by using ECM\u2019s PrintStator software there is the ability to create motors that can fit in very thin axial spaces and conform to the non-standard enclosures,\u201d Luchars detailed."
