        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "The Biggest CES 2024 PC News From Intel, AMD, Dell, HP, Nvidia, Lenovo And Micron\nAt CES 2024, the emerging AI PC category was a big topic for some of the channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest vendors such as HP Inc., Lenovo, Dell Technologies, Intel, AMD and Nvidia. CRN rounds up the most important PC news coming out of the annual trade show that partners need to know.\nIf you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening before, some of the channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest vendors wanted to make sure you got the message at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CES 2024 event: the AI PC is here.\nWhat started as a steadily growing drumbeat last year of pronouncements about the AI PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut from major chip companies and OEMs turned into a harmony of industry forces saying we are now in a new era of computers with advanced AI capabilities.\n[Related: Analysis: 5 Takeaways On The State Of AI PCs And Why Big Channel Vendors Are Excited]\nThis was apparent not only from the announcements about new AI-enabled PCs from Dell Technologies, HP Inc. and Lenovo but also the keynotes from Nvidia, AMD and Intel, who revealed new processors for AI PCs.\nAs CRN reported for\u00c2\u00a0AI PC Week in December, these vendors believe AI PCs will reinvigorate the computer industry and lead to new opportunities for solution providers. However, while some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killer apps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd already exist, vendors are still on the hunt for many more that will make AI-enabled PCs indispensable.\nWhat follows are the biggest PC news developments to come out of CES 2024 from HP Inc., Lenovo, Dell, Intel, AMD, Nvidia and Micron Technology. These developments cover everything from new AI-enabled laptops and desktops to new CPUs and GPUs for AI PCs as well as a game-changing modular memory form factor that could give the category a big boost.\nNvidia Launches RTX Super 40 GPUs, GenAI Software For PCs\nWhile Nvidia used CES 2024 to launch a new batch of GeForce RTX GPUs for desktop PCs, the AI chip giant came to the convention with a bigger message about how its graphics chips are powering more than 100 million high-performance AI PCs.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Generative AI is the single most significant platform transition in computing history and will transform every industry, including gaming,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With over 100 million RTX AI PCs and workstations, Nvidia is a massive install base for developers and gamers to enjoy the magic of generative AI.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe company said its new GeForce RTX 40 Super Series GPUs not only raise the bar for gaming performance compared to previous models. The GPUs are also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the ultimate way to experience AI on PCs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thanks to their specialized Tensor Cores delivering up to 836 AI tera operations per second to boost gaming, creativity and productivity, according to Nvidia.\nTo enable new generative AI experiences and highlight the capabilities of its GPUs, Nvidia released several new applications and services for PCs, including a version of the popular Stable Diffusion XL text-to-image model that is designed to run faster on Nvidia GPUs through the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TensorRT software library.\nThe chip designer also announced that it plans to release later this month Chat with RTX, a tech demo that uses Nvidia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open-source TensorRT-LLM software library to connect large language models with a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data through a technique known as retrieval-augmented generation. Nvidia said the tech demo, which can help users \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quickly interact with their notes, documents and other content,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will also be made available as an open-source reference project for developers.\nThe other AI applications and services coming to PCs include Nvidia RTX Remix, which provides generative AI tools to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transform basic textures from class games into modern, 4K-resolution, physically based rendering materials.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is also Nvidia ACE microservices, which lets developers use generative AI to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add intelligent, dynamic digital avatars to games.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nNvidia also highlighted that it plans to release Nvidia AI Workbench, a free platform for creating, testing and customizing pretrained generative AI models, in beta later this month. Developers can then scale those projects to any data center or cloud infrastructure.\nIntel Teases Next-Gen AI PC Chips, Reveals Core 14th Gen HX-Series\nLast month, Intel launched its much-hyped Core Ultra \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meteor Lake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to enable the first wave of laptops with advanced AI capabilities, so the company used CES 2024 to share news about OEMs backing the new chips, successor chips set to arrive later this year and a new family of processors for heavy-duty laptops running demanding applications.\nThe chipmaker also revealed 18 new processors in its Core 14th Gen desktop lineup and a trio of chips for mainstream ultrathin laptops in the Core U Series 1 lineup.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This year, you can expect more than 750 designs across both Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra families from our top global OEM partners like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, LG, MSI, Microsoft Surface Samsung, and so many more,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the general manager of Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Client Computing Group, at a CES keynote on Monday.\nArrow Lake, Lunar Lake Are Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Next AI PC Chips\nAt the keynote, Holthaus revealed that Intel plans to launch or at least start shipping to OEMs two successors to Core Ultra, Arrow Lake for desktop PCs and Lunar Lake for laptops.\nHolthaus said Arrow Lake is Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first desktop gaming CPU with an AI accelerator,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which refers to the neural processing unit (NPU) that debuted in the Core Ultra chips to handle low-power AI workloads in laptop. She added that Arrow Lake will represent an extension of the Meteor Lake architecture used for the first Core Ultra chips.\nLunar Lake, on the other hand, is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radically new low-power architecture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant [instructions per clock] improvements in the CPU core and more than three times more AI performance on both the GPU and the NPU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd compared to Meteor Lake, Holthaus said.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our execution on this product has been excellent. And I'm pleased to say that we're already shipping systems to partners. It's up and running. It's doing very well. And Lunar Lake is truly [delivering] the next-level AI performance for thin-and-light PCs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.\nIntel Core 14th Gen HX-Series Brings Big Horsepower To Laptops\nDesigned for gamers, content creators and professionals who want super-fast performance, the Intel Core 14th Gen HX-series is one of the last CPU families to use the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old branding scheme for client processors (the new branding is represented by the new Core Ultra and Core chips, which lack a generation designator in their names).\nThe company said the new HX-series processors will be made available this year in more than 60 laptop designs from HP Inc., Lenovo, Asus, Dell, Acer and other OEMs.\nThe Intel Core 14th Gen HX-series processors feature up to a 5.8GHz turbo frequency and as many as 24 cores and 32 threads. They also support up to 192GB in DDR5 memory capacity with 5600 megatransfers per second in addition, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity with 80 Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth, Intel Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 as well as Bluetooth 5.4 and 5.3.\nAll five chips in the lineup, which range from the Core i9-14900HX to the Core i5-14450HX, have a base power of 55W and a max turbo power of 157W.\nWhen it comes to benchmarks measuring overall performance, productivity performance and content creation performance, Intel said the Core i9-14900HX is faster in varying degrees than AMD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ryzen 9 7945HX.\nMicron Reveals Modular Memory To Boost Laptop Performance, Efficiency\nMicron Technology revealed at CES 2024 a new standard for modular memory in laptops that it said will enable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher performance, energy-efficiency, space savings and modularity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe technology is called low-power compression attached memory module, or LPCAMM2 for short, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant to replace the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s practice of soldering memory DIMMs directly onto the motherboard for ultrathin laptops and devices with innovative form factors like foldable PCs.\nThe introduction of Micron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modular memory solution for PCs represents one of the first attempts to commercialize the LPCAMM2 specification, which was, with Micron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sponsorship, defined by JEDEC, a microelectronics trade group that is behind many memory standards.\nThe LPCAMM concept was first introduced by Dell Technologies in 2022. Now there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a movement to commercialize the technology as a new standard, which started with Samsung Electronics last fall and continues with Micron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new announcement.\nAccording to Micron, the LPCAMM2 form factor will support LPDDR5X memory capacities from 16GB to 64GB, and it will provide several benefits, both for end-users and OEMs.\nWhen compared to SODIMM offerings, LPCAMM2 can provide 71 percent better performance and 61 percent lower power for common workloads such as web browsing and video conferencing as well as 64 percent space savings.\nThe modular nature of LPCAMM2 also means users will once again have the option to upgrade or replace a laptop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s memory, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible with soldered-on RAM.\nJake Whatcott, director of marketing for Micron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compute and networking business unit, told CRN that the timing of LPCAMM2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival is fortuitous, addressing major pain points in laptops like performance, battery life and portability that have become increasingly important in the post-COVID-19 hybrid work era. It will also help laptops better handle the AI workloads that chip companies and OEMs are starting to promote for new devices.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153LPCAMM2 is not just, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, here's another way to build memory,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 It's really the next generation of memory that addresses everything that's changed in the past three to four years and everything that's going to change in the next three to four years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.\nAMD Brings AI Engine To Desktop PCs With Ryzen 8000G\nLike Intel, AMD launched a new lineup of CPUs for laptops with advanced AI capabilities in December. Except for AMD, it was the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second generation of AI chips for laptops to come out in 2023: the Ryzen 8040 series. So the chip designer used CES 2024 to reveal its first desktop CPU with a dedicated AI engine, the Ryzen 8000G series.\nLike the Ryzen 7040 and 8040 series for laptops, the Ryzen 8000G desktop processors come with a neural processing unit (NPU) in addition to a CPU and GPU. And the company said the lineup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s integrated GPU is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful built-in graphics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe inclusion of a dedicated AI engine and powerful integrated graphics, combined with up to eight cores and a 5.1GHz boost frequency, is why the chip designer is calling the Ryzen 8000G series the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ultimate all-in-one desktop processor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe CPU in the Ryzen 8000G series is based on AMD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zen 4 architecture while the GPU is based on its RDNA 3 architecture and the NPU is based on the XDNA architecture. Combined, they provide a total of up 39 teraflops of processing power for AI workloads, AMD said.\nAMD said the Ryzen 8000G series will be available to consumers and system integration partners starting Jan. 31. The CPUs will start appearing in OEM systems in the second quarter.\nAMD: Ryzen 8040 Series Outshines Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Core Ultra Chips For AI\nIn addition to revealing the Ryzen 8000G series for desktops, AMD used CES 2024 to provide new competitive performance data comparing its recently released Ryzen 8040 laptop processors with Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Core Ultra notebook chips that came out around the same time.\nIn the realm of computer vision models that benefit from the NPU, AMD said its Ryzen 7 8840U processor is 4 percent faster on the MobileNetv3 model, 17 percent faster on the ESRGAN model, 43 percent faster on the Yolov8 model and 79 percent faster on the Deeplabv3 in comparison to Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Core Ultra 7 155H.\nAs for AI-powered content creation workloads that benefit from the GPU, AMD said the same chip is 6 percent faster on the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model, 44 percent faster on the Procyon AI Bench test using the Float32 numerical format, 61 percent faster on Procyon AI Bench using Float16 and 85 percent faster on DaVinci Resolve HD to UHD video upscaling feature.\nLenovo Reveals AI PCs In Different Shapes And Sizes\nLenovo came to CES 2024 with a wide array of AI-enabled PCs, from consumer-focused laptops to ultra-small form factor desktops loaded with neural processing units (NPUs).\nThe Chinese tech giant said its flagship AI PC offerings consist of the new Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 and IdeaPad Pro 5i, which take advantage of the Intel Core Ultra processors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dedicated AI acceleration combined with Copilot in Windows 11 to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help users embrace new experiences and enhance efficiency in work and play.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether for business or leisure, these Lenovo laptops are amongst the first that are driving an AI PC revolution that will fundamentally change how people create, collaborate, and interact with PCs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said in an announcement.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Designed to offer users the most comprehensive PC experiences yet, the new ThinkPad X1 and IdeaPad Pro 5i will help users embrace a new generation of AI computing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it added.\nThe other AI-enabled PCs revealed by Lenovo consisted of consumer and business devices.\nThe consumer-focused devices include the new Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16-inch laptop and 14-inch 2-1, which not only come with Intel Core Ultra processors\u00e2\u20ac\u201deach containing an NPU in addition to a CPU and GPU\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut also a Lenovo AI Core Chip that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powers robust AI functionality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAll new Yoga laptops come loaded with generative AI software called Lenovo Yoga Creator Zone, which generates images from text-based prompts or sketches.\nOn the business side, Lenovo introduced a few other PCs advertised with AI capabilities, including the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 I Gen 6+5, which comes with a Graphics Extension port that supports Lenovo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new ThinkBook Graphics Extension dock to boost AI computing power.\nAnother laptop with AI capabilities is the Lenovo ThinkBook 16p Gen 5, which comes with a Intel Core 14th Gen CPU and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPU, the latter of which can be used for AI use cases such as the text-to-image model Stable Diffusion.\nThe ThinkBook 16p Gen 5 also comes with the Lenovo LA3 AI chip, which is used in conjunction with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Smart Power 3.0 and Intelligent Adaptive Dimming technologies to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimize system performance, energy efficiency and battery charging.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nLenovo also revealed the ThinkCentre neo Ultra, an ultra-small form factor desktop that comes with an Intel CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPU and an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy-to-upgrade independent NPU card\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd developed by chip design startup MemryX.\nOther CES highlights from Lenovo include the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i, the Intel Core Ultra-powered successor to its original full size dual-screen OLED laptop; the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid, which is made up of a laptop base system and a tablet that can work independently of each other and switch between Windows- and Android-based systems.\nDell: New XPS Laptops Get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBuilt-In AI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Thanks To Intel CPUs\nA few days before CES 2024, Dell Technologies revealed that its next wave of XPS laptops are getting new 14-inch and 16-inch options along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153built-in AI\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd capabilities thanks to the Intel Core Ultra chips going inside the systems.\nThe Round Rock, Texas-based IT giant revealed the new XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops, saying the trio of flagship consumer notebooks adopt the fresh minimalistic design of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game-changing XPS 13 Plus model.\nThe three new XPS designs are powered by Intel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new Core Ultra processors, which launched last month. Previously known under the code name Meteor Lake, each chip comes with a CPU, GPU and, for the first time in an Intel chip, a neural processing unit (NPU).\nIntel has said in recent months that the Core Ultra processors will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153usher in the age of the AI PC\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of how AI applications with different performance and power requirements will take advantage of each chip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPU, GPU and NPU\u00e2\u20ac\u201drather than relying on the cloud.\nDell said the new XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16 come with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI-enabled features\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thanks to Intel Core Ultra processors and experiences enabled by Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11. The new designs even come with a key to instantly access Copilot as part of Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push for OEMs to include a Copilot key for new laptops.\nWith Core Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NPU, Dell said the PC \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no longer needs to rely solely on the CPU or GPU for processing and performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This, in turn, will enable faster performance and longer battery life for applications that can take advantage of the low-power AI engine.\nHP Brings AI Features To Spectre x360 Laptops Thanks to Intel\nAt CES 2024, HP Inc. revealed a pair of new Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptops that adapt to the user in a variety of ways and enable a variety of AI workloads thanks to their Intel Core Ultra processors and optional Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPUs.\nThe new laptops consist of a 14-inch model and a 16-inch model, both of which will take advantage of the Core Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CPU, GPU and neural processing unit (NPU)\u00e2\u20ac\u201din addition to the GeForce RTX GPU for models configured with the part\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto handle a variety of AI workloads depending on their performance and power requirements.\nThese AI workloads include several features to make the laptops more responsive to a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique situation and surroundings.\nFor instance, the laptops use the NPU, combined with their 9-megapixel webcam, to alert the user when someone is watching the screen from over their shoulder, lock the computer when the user walks away and wake up the computer when the user returns. The laptops also come with adaptive screen technology that dims the display when the user looks away.\nAs for other ways the laptops can adapt to a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence, the 9-megapixel camera features \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hardware-enabled low-light adjustment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for video calls where there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adequate lighting.\nHP has also loaded the Spectre x360 laptops with a temperature sensor, gravity sensor and acceleration sensor. Using these sensors, an AI model can adjust the laptop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thermal profile based on whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a desk or the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lap.\nAs for other AI features, HP said the laptops can use Superpower, a new application from an ISV called Rewind that can use the Core Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NPU for tasks such as tracking down action items from a meeting, summarizing a topic or helping draft an email.\nThe Spectre x360 devices seize on the NPU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AI acceleration capabilities in other ways, such as automatic framing, background blur and maintaining eye contact, features that are enabled by Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Windows Studio effects.\nFor display, the laptops feature a 2.8K OLED screen and IMAX Enhanced Certification for watching movies and TV shows in the 16:10 aspect ratio.\nFor the first time in HP consumer devices, the 2-in-1s feature audio tuning by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poly video collaboration business to provide better voice clarity and sound.\nAdditional reporting by Steven Burke."

        "raw_content": "Micron at CES 2024: USB4 SSD Technology Demonstrations\nMicron's consumer brand, Crucial Memory, has been putting extra focus on the SSD market over the last few quarters. The brand was marketing entry-level QLC drives in the 2018 - 2022 time frame. Recently, emphasis has also been placed on cutting-edge SSDs - both internal (such as the Gen4 T500 and Gen5 T700) and external (such as the X10 Pro). Vertical integration, coupled with Micron being the first flash manufacturer to achieve volume production of 200+ layer 3D NAND, has been crucial to Crucial's success in these segments.\nAt the 2024 CES, Micron had a couple of interesting USB4 SSD technology demonstrations for its resellers / partners and invited media. These are essentially products under development (with no guarantees that they would make it to the market in their current form). Both products are bridge-based solutions using the ASMedia ASM2464PD USB4 to NVMe accessory controller. The key update over the popular ASM2364 (USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 upstream, and PCIe 3.0 x4 downstream) is the shift to a 40 Gbps USB4 upstream port along with a PCIe 4.0 x4 link downstream. The power delivery component of the Type-C specification is also implemented within the controller.\nThe portable SSD version has a gumstick form-factor, with the transparent casing housing a M.2 2280 SSD - a 2TB Gen4 Micron 3400 OEM drive in this case.\nThe drive is expected to be passively cooled, with the larger form-factor enabling a thermal performance similar to that of the X10 Pro / X9 Pro. Bridge-based solutions are the standard option for high-performance portable SSDs.\nSimilar configurations (bridge + DRAM-equipped M.2 SSD) such as the SanDisk Extreme PRO v2 (E81) have yielded excellent all-round performance for a wide range of workload types. We expect the same to continue in the USB4 era. That said, vendors like ADATA using the same bridge have opted for active cooling to avoid thermal throttling in their USB4 PSSD. It remains to be seen if this design will remain fanless in its final form (and if it does, thermal performance would be an interesting aspect to analyze).\nThe USB4 desktop SSD is a comparatively unique product. This is an actively cooled design with a small fan, and uses a U.3 SSD inside. Other vendors like OWC have tried multiple M.2 SSDs configured with software RAID in a large-sized enclosure, but this one has a single high-capacity drive (8TB in the sample being demonstrated).\nDesigned for stacking (without daisy-chaining support), the eSSD also requires external power. The drive can also power notebooks through the USB4 connection, which can make up for the presence of a discrete power adapter. Specifics of the power delivery will only be available when the product is officially introduced. This product could be made more attractive by having some downstream USB Type-A / Type-C ports (eSSD in a dock). That said, there are two aspects that will probably make this the performance and consistency king of USB4 SSDs - the presence of a fan, and the use of a Gen4 U.3 SSD (which is most likely an enterprise drive that advertises worst-case performance and not speeds in the SLC cache region).\nThe current crop of USB4 SSDs are focused on performance, and sacrifice power- and energy-efficiency. Those aspects will be addressed by native USB4 UFD controllers like Phison's U21. Silicon Motion tends to keep controllers under wraps until reference designs are ready to ship (if the introduction of the SM2320 was anything to go by). We expect external / portable SSD vendors to eventually add native UFD controller-based products to their USB4 lineup, but that seems unlikely to happen in the first half of 2024.\nPost Your Comment\n12 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: Evolution and Revolution\nThough AI was a popular buzzword, faster and better designed products dominated\nCES, the world\u2019s leading trade show, is back! Yes, there were in-person versions of the show in 2022 and 2023, but this year is the first since 2020 that felt \u201cnormal.\u201d The halls were crowded full of eager attendees, the show floors were packed with booths and most of the companies we usually visit with at CES had a presence.\nGoing into the show, we expected to hear the word \u201cAI\u201d every five seconds that we talked with vendors, but in the enthusiast tech world, we heard it a bit less often than our colleagues who cover TVs, appliances and phones at other websites. Instead, it seems that nothing beats good design, more processing power and a positive user experience.\nIntel and the laptop vendors which use its CPUs showed off various local AI workloads, which mostly involved generating images or managing power profiles And AI underpins Nvidia\u2019s gaming technologies. But there are only so many times we can prompt Stable Diffusion\u2019s GIMP plugin to draw a cat driving a car, before we get bored. MSI is the one company that wowed us with a true AI innovation: a monitor that uses computer vision to analyze your game\u2019s map and point out where enemies are coming from.\nInsead, we were excited to see a number of products that really moved the ball forward in ways that were more evolutionary than revolutionary: new graphics cards and CPUs \u00a0that add more performance for the money, a high-end 3D printer that zooms along at 600 mm/s and works with carbon fiber or a gorgeous OLED monitor that can run at up to 480 Hz at 1080p or 240 Hz at 4K.\nThese are the 15 best products of CES 2024.\nBest Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 4070 Super\nNvidia announced three new RTX 40-series Super model graphics cards, and AMD revealed its RX 7600 XT 16GB. While all four will vie for a spot on our list of the best graphics cards for gaming (and other uses), the one we're most excited about is\u2026 well, honestly it's a bit hard to nail things down. Nvidia provides more performance for a lower price than its existing non-Super cards, so things definitely moved in the right direction. AMD provides double the VRAM and slightly higher performance with its new GPU, at a higher price than the RX 7600. But none of the new models are all that surprising \u2014 we've been hearing rumors about both for several months at least. Still, if we have to just pick one for an award, it's the new RTX 4070 Super.\nFundamentally, you're getting about 93% of the RTX 4070 Ti, for 75% of the price. Alternatively, you're getting 22% more GPU than the RTX 4070 for the same price. More importantly, you're at least getting 12GB of high-speed GDDR6X memory, along with access to Nvidia's RTX technologies: DLSS, superior ray tracing, and AI tensor cores. Given the RTX 4070 already trades blows with the RX 7800 XT \u2014 slightly slower rasterization performance, much faster ray tracing and AI performance, and the RTX 4070 Ti does the same with the RX 7900 XT \u2014 Nvidia now effectively delivers a higher performance option at the same price.\nThe RTX 4070 Super launches next week, so check back then for our full review and benchmarks.\nRead more: Nvidia RTX 40-series Super models revealed\n\u2014Jarred Walton\nBest CPU: Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G\nAMD rolled out its Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 lineup of APUs at CES 2024, beating Intel to the punch as the first company to bring purpose-built AI accelerators to the desktop PC -- its second such feat after it was the first to bring AI to laptops with the same XDNA-powered neural processing unit (NPU). The chips also boast a powerful integrated RDNA 3 graphics engine that AMD claims delivers 1080p-capable gaming performance, even in some AAA titles, albeit at the reduced fidelity settings we\u2019d expect from this class of chip.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, AMD builds its APUs for the desktop using the same silicon as its laptop chips. In this case, AMD leverages the Phoenix architecture that employs the Zen 4 CPU architecture and RDNA 3 graphics engine. However, the lack of battery life concerns in desktop PCs allows the chip to run at higher power limits, thus unleashing the full power of the silicon. AMD\u2019s two flagship models, the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G, boast eight and six cores, respectively. AMD also brought its new APU lineup up to modern standards with support for AM5\u2019s DDR5 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, crafting what should be exceptionally powerful processors given their accessible price point.\nAMD\u2019s APUs have historically dominated the entry-level gaming market because Intel doesn\u2019t have processors with powerful enough integrated graphics to provide meaningful gaming performance, even for the lowest-end gaming systems. AMD\u2019s previous-gen Ryzen 5 5600G has long been one of the \u00a0Best CPUs for gaming \u00a0due to its surprisingly strong graphics performance, and we expect the new models to assume that mantle once again.\nThe chips feature FSR, HYPR-RX, and Fluid Motion Frames support, competitive pricing, and bundled coolers for all three SKUs. The new Ryzen APU models are poised to dominate the entry-level gaming segment once again when they arrive on January 31, winning our pick for the best CPU of CES 2024.\nRead more: AMD launches Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 APUs, brings AI to the desktop PC\n-Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Monitor: Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP\nWhen it comes to the best gaming monitors, you often must make some hard choices regarding performance and maximum image quality. You can go with an IPS panel and get ultra-fast 500 Hz refresh rates but compromise on contrast and color. Or you can opt for an OLED panel, which offers vibrant colors and inky blacks but falls short of class-leading refresh rate performance.\nFortunately, Asus is coming to the rescue with its ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP gaming monitor, hoping to give gamers the best of both worlds. In its standard operating mode, the PG32UCDP seems like any other modern high-end 32-inch gaming monitor with a brilliant OLED panel, a 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a fast 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. There\u2019s enough resolution for productivity tasks when not gaming and plenty of performance overhead for 4K gaming with the best graphics cards.\nHowever, the real spicy action happens when you switch to Frame Rate Boost mode. Gamers can quickly toggle this setting on the monitor, which drops the resolution down to Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and boosts the maximum refresh rate to 480 Hz. That next-level speed and performance put it on even footing with the Alienware AW2524H and AW2524HF, which have a native refresh rate of 480 Hz at Full HD resolution. However, those fraternal Alienware twins can hit 500Hz with an overlock setting in the OSD.\nStill, the ability for gamers to pick and choose when they want maximum resolution or maximum performance, all while maintaining the image quality advantages of OLED, must be commended. Asus also gets the basics right, with HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectivity, 90-watt USB-C Power Delivery, and an integrated KVM switch.\nWe\u2019ll be curious to see how the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP performs once we get it in the lab.\nRead more: Asus announces two new OLED gaming monitors delivering 480 Hz at up to 1440p resolution\n--Brandon Hill\nBest Memory: Micron LPCAMM2\nMicron unveiled its new LPCAMM2 memory modules at CES 2024. Despite earlier announcements from competing companies, Micron will be the first to actually bring memory modules based on the new standard to market. Perhaps more important for those looking for the ultimate in performance, these new modules unlock speeds of 9,600 MT/s via LPDDR5X memory, a massive increase over the standard SODIMM peak of DDR5-6400. However, that\u2019s just one of the many advantages of this new memory form factor that will become common in performance-oriented laptops over the coming years.\nThe LPCAMM2 standard also promises to bring fast and power-efficient LPDDR5X memory to laptops in a removable form factor for the first time, meaning the memory chips are no longer required to be soldered directly to the motherboard. These new modules will replace the standard SODIMMs that dominate current laptops, but the innovative design consumes 80% less power and 64% less space inside the chassis, thus enabling longer battery life and even slimmer laptop designs. LPCAMM2 also provides a dual-channel memory interface from a single module, a first. The modules will come in 16, 32, and 64GB capacities at first, with room to grow up to 128GB of capacity in a single module in the future.\nThe power and space savings, not to mention the speed improvements, of Micron\u2019s LPCAMM2 are set to redefine our expectations for laptop memory, earning our award for the best memory of CES 2024.\nRead more: Micron displays next-gen LPCAMM2 modules for laptops at CES 2024\n\u2013Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14/G16\nAsus took classic, beloved laptops known for performance, portability, and even battery life, and made them sleeker than ever. The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are slimmer and have newer, more adult designs than before, and, well, it looks great. There's only so much you can do without a new GPU to push forward graphics, so Asus dug into the design.\nFor the G14, that does mean topping out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, while the G16 uses up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and RTX 4090. Both have silver and black options with a stripe on the lid, rather than a garish massive ROG logo or AniMe Matrix. I'm not going to say it looks like it could double as a business laptop, but it's far more attractive.\nThey're also getting, on paper, really nice screens, with Asus' OLED Nebula displays. The 14-incher gets a 2880 x 1800 screen at 120 Hz, while the bigger 16-inch laptop goes to 2560 x 1600 at 240 Hz. In a brief trial, both looked great, and we're excited to see just how well they perform in real testing.\nRead more: Asus ROG Zephyrus gets a sleek, slim new look with AMD Hawk Point and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Laptop: Asus Zenbook Duo\nThis was a contentious category among the Tom's Hardware judges, with some favoring the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1's even approach to a refresh without reinventing the wheel, while others like the very-CES approach of the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid and its ability to run both Windows and Android with a tablet and base station. But the Asus Zenbook Duo kept coming up as an option that seemed like a refined idea at a price point that's not crazy.\nThe Zenbook Duo has a pair of 14-inch OLED displays and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. It's an idea we first saw hit production in Lenovo's Yoga Book 9i, but that one had a U-series CPU and an origami kickstand that wasn't intuitive. Asus' Zenbook Duo's kickstand is permanently attached to the laptop, and it goes up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. So it should be easier to use and more powerful. The Asus model has far more ports than the Yoga, including HDMI alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWhile we don't have a final price for it, it's been suggested to us that it will hover around $1,500. If that sticks, it won't be a ridiculous price, considering the Yoga was almost $2,000 when we reviewed it.\nI did have a bit of trouble getting the early unit at Asus' briefing to stand up straight with the monitors side to side, but otherwise it seemed like a solid machine, and we're eager to see what it can do.\nRead more: Asus Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen foldable with two 14-inch OLED screens and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Gaming Handheld: MSI Claw\nOne way to make a splash at CES is to be the first to do something. And while the MSI Claw isn't the first modern handheld gaming PC, it is the first mainstream PC brand to use Intel Core Ultra processors (or Intel at all. Lenovo, Asus, and Valve all opted for AMD chips). It's also packing a bigger battery than other handhelds, even if MSI isn't exactly claiming record-breaking battery life.\nMSi is claiming that it's producing a more ergonomic device, and while the plastic did divide some of our editors on the show floor, we're looking forward to trying it in long-term use. The screen seems similar to the one on the Asus ROG Ally, but considering that was a pretty decent screen, it's hard to argue with.\nIntel improving in graphics means we get more competition in handheld gaming outside of the Kickstarter space. We're looking forward to seeing how Intel and MSI put their own mark on it with MSI Center M, XeSS, and other technologies.\nRead more: MSI Claw is the first gaming handheld to run on an Intel Core Ultra processor with Arc Graphics\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Cooling / DIY: Hyte Nexus Link\nIt\u2019s not easy to get excited about an ecosystem at a show like CES, but Hyte\u2019s Nexus Link was a standout for me.This cable-decluttering and system-building simplification platform is clearly a competitor to Corsair's iCue Link, with similar daisy-chained magnetic connectors and fans. But Hyte also offers magnetic RGB strips that use the same connector, and the products have a quirky but much more interesting design.\nNexus Link is powered by a quad-core Arm CPU housed in the screen built into the company\u2019s Thicc Q60 AIO cooler, which we first saw at Computex last year. It sports a thick 240mm radiator and chunky fans that the company claims will outperform any 360mm radiator currently on the market. So the importance of performance isn\u2019t getting left behind in the quest for clean design.\nIn my brief hands-on time with it, the whole Nexus Link ecosystem, from the hardware to the software, felt more refined, definitely more visually interesting, and arguably better built than what Corsair has done with iCue Link. That's a little shocking from a company so comparatively new and unknown.\nI will wait for the chance to build a Nexus Link system and spend some time with the software before I can say for sure how it compares to the competition from Corsair and Lian Li, and others. But on first impression, Hyte looks to be on the verge of pulling off a major upset in the DIY PC space.\nRead more: Hyte's Nexus Link ecosystem of RGB devices makes building rainbow PCs seem easier than ever\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest PC Case: MSI MEG Maestro 700L PG\nWe saw quite a few PC cases designed to support motherboards with rear-facing connectors here at CES 2024, and MSI\u2019s Project Zero boards are some of the first to market using Maingear\u2019s patent. But most are fairly compact, and don\u2019t support full-size ATX options. MSI\u2019s large MEG Maestro 700L PG, though, supports up to E-ATX boards \u2013 like most of these cases, it will work with traditional motherboards as well). But the 700L PG takes the en vogue \u201cfishbowl\u201d case style to the next level, with the entire front and side panel made up of one massive curved piece of tempered glass.\nThe rest of the case is crafted from large panels of 2.5 mm-thick aluminum, and the dual-panel design hides the PSU behind the motherboard, along with all the wires and connectors. Don\u2019t worry about airflow, because fans or large radiators can be mounted in front of the motherboard, as well as on the top or bottom of the case.\nAs you might expect, this will be an expensive case, with an MSI rep telling us that it will cost around $400 when it arrives sometime in the next month or so. It\u2019s far from cheap, but if you crave that clean interior look with acres of glass to show off your GPU and other components, MSI\u2019s MEG Maestro 700L PG is arguably the prettiest of these kinds of cases we\u2019ve seen yet. But at the same time, just looking at that large bent piece of glass makes us more than a little nervous.\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest Mouse: Mad Catz MMO 7+\nIt's been a while since we've seen Mad Catz \u2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and then quietly revived under new ownership in 2018, but it hasn't exactly been making waves. But the brand is back at CES this year with a slew of gaming peripherals, including a new wireless version of an old classic: the MMO 7.\nThe new MMO 7+ is a wireless version of Mad Catz' classic MMO-focused multi-button mouse, with some improvements that bring it into 2024. It features a whopping 21 programmable buttons with a shift mode and five profiles for up to 210 inputs (okay, that's a little ambitious \u2014 but still, 21 buttons is pretty impressive). What's nice is that those 21 buttons are not just laid out in a 12-button side panel like most MMO mice have (see: Razer's Naga V2 Pro, Corsair's Scimitar Elite Wireless, etc), but are kind of... all over the mouse, which makes them easier to differentiate. Like the old MMO 7, it's modular and will come packaged with interchangeable palm rests and pinky rests, as well as a tool that will let you change the palm and thumb rest positions.\nAside from wireless connectivity (2.4GHz and Bluetooth) and a USB-C charging port, the MMO 7+ also features a Pixart PAW-3395 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 26,000DPI, a maximum speed of 650 IPS, and up to 50 G's of acceleration, as well as customizable RGB lighting and a horizontal scroll wheel. The only real disappointment is battery life, which is currently rated at 40 hours \u2014 most gaming mice these days are hitting 75 - 120 hours, so that's a pretty big difference. Still, it's nice to see a mouse that's not just a stripped-down, ultra-lightweight, FPS-oriented pointer with the promise of unnecessarily high polling rates.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Keyboard: Cooler Master MK770\nWe've seen a lot of keyboards at CES 2024, and we actually saw this keyboard \u2014 or, well, the prototype of it \u2014 at CES 2023. But while we've seen a lot of gaming companies making keyboards to appeal to both gamers and keyboard enthusiasts, we haven't seen a lot of them also taking budget into account. Cooler Master's MK770 has all the premium features we've been looking for \u2014 gasket-mounted, hot-swappable, wireless with tri-mode connectivity, double-shot PBT keycaps, and more than one colorway \u2014 and it's set to cost just $119 when it launches this year.\nThe MK770 is also a 96-percent keyboard, meaning it's practically full-sized (minus some navigation keys) while still being relatively compact (or, well, as compact as you can get without sacrificing your number pad). It features a solid-feeling chassis with two sets of flip-out feet on the bottom \u2014 and cleverly-placed dongle storage under one of the flip-out feet, and has a programmable clickable volume knob. It's not the most feature-rich keyboard, but it's got everything you need for wireless gaming and it's hot-swappable.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Innovation: MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED\nBigger, faster, more colorful. Those are three aspects that we typically track when new monitors are announced. For example, ASRock is making waves with its new 27-inch 520Hz gaming monitor, and vibrant OLED monitors are becoming more commonplace. But what if a company could make a monitor smarter? That's not something we'd thought about until now, with the introduction of the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED and its onboard AI acceleratoOne feature of the AI hardware, dubbed SkySight, can automatically pinpoint and mark enemies on the screen in games like League of Legends. Instantly knowing what direction your enemies are coming from \u00a0is a definite perk, even if you could do the tracking with your own eyes.\nAll the AI processing is performed onboard the monitor and is undetectable since there is no intervention from your operating system or other installed software. We could see this being frowned upon by competitive gamers as an unfair advantage, but the underlying technology that frames SkySight is intriguing.\nThe MEG 321URX even features what MSI calls a Spectrum Bar (basically, a thin RGB strip) that sits below the display. Once again, using League of Legends as an example, the Spectrum Bar can light up to mirror your character's current health status. Even though League of Legends was the primary focus of MSI's CES demos, the company plans to release software for training to detect on-screen items for just about any game. It would be cool to see the Spectrum Bar used to mimic shift lights that you would see on a steering wheel on an F1 driver's steering wheel in games like EA's F1 23.\nLooking past the AI intrigue, the MEG 321URX's specs sheet is impressive in its own right, with a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel. The monitor can even achieve 240Hz at that native resolution with a 0.03ms response time. It also features a USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 support.\nKeep an eye out for the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED when it debuts this spring.\nRead more: MSI's AI-powered gaming monitor helps you cheat at 'League of Legends,' looks great doing it\n--Brandon Hill\nBest 3D Printer: Creality K1C\nCreality\u2019s flagship K1 printer was already excellent, providing high-quality output at speeds as high as 600 mm/s. However, the K1 isn\u2019t perfect and there are a few things that Creality fans had wanted from it, including the ability to sustain higher temperatures and work with more exotic filaments.\nEnter the Creality K1C, which takes everything we like about the K1 and builds upon it. The new printer features an all-metal hotend which allows it to operate at a steady 300 degrees and therefore work with carbon fiber (that\u2019s what the C in K1C is for). The printer also has a revised bowden tube path, better build plate and other improvements we don\u2019t know about yet (the company has not released full specs). One of the leading 3D printer companies has a new leading device.\nRead more: Creality unveils new flagship K1C 3D printer and latest Ender 3 V3 model\n\u2013 Avram Piltch\nBest SSD: Phison PCIe 5.0 powered drives and controllers\nPhison previewed its E26 Max14um firmware prior to CES, and we saw multiple drives that should soon hit retail with performance of up to 14 GB/s. The key to enablement of the Micron 2400 MT/s NAND involved firmware updates and tuning to keep the controller within the PCIe M.2 power limit. Which brings us to the second part of this award.\nThe Phison E26 controller has been powering the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives of the past year, but the real innovation is set to arrive with the next generation E31 controller that will launch later this year. E26 is manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, and the E31 will move to TSMC 7nm (N7). At that point, the combination of NAND and controller should effectively max out what we can expect to see from PCIe 5.0 drives \u2014 we'll need PCIe 6.0 to get significantly faster.\nPut another way, Phison is moving the entire high-performance consumer SSD market forward. Without Phison, we'd still be stuck with PCIe 4.0 drives for at least a few more months. We've had PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots on Z690 motherboards since 2021 and had to wait two years to get SSDs that would make use of the technology, and we have Phison to thank for that.\n\u2013 Jarred Walton\nBest Motherboard: ASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi\nASRock already owns most of the slots on our Best Motherboards page for current-gen chipsets, because the company has recently been delivering solid feature sets at comparatively low prices, while the rest of the industry seems content to churn out ever-more-expensive boards for the kinds of builders who still have $1,000 or more left over after buying the shiny new RTX 4080 Super.\nAnd the new Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi, at just $200, looks to continue that trend for those looking to build a compact but powerful Mini-ITX with up to an Intel 14900K, thanks to 14+1+1 power phase setup, adorned with some chunky heatsinks.\nThe dual-DIMM setup that\u2019s typical of ITX boards should also make for top-speed RAM support. The only limiting factor here is that the board seems to only have a single PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot, although there could be another hiding on the back of the board. We hope to get this board in soon and run it through our benchmark suite. If it performs as expected, this will likely be an appealing motherboard for many gamers looking to build a powerful compact rig while spending most of their build budget on things like the GPU and CPU.\nRead More: ASRock's $200 Mini-ITX motherboard to support Intel Core i9-14900K\n\u2013 Matt Safford\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

The brand was marketing entry-level QLC drives in the 2018 \u2013 2022 time frame. Recently, emphasis has also been placed on cutting-edge SSDs \u2013 both internal (such as the Gen4 T500 and Gen5 T700) and external (such as the X10 Pro). Vertical integration, coupled with Micron being the first flash manufacturer to achieve volume production of 200+ layer 3D NAND, has been crucial to Crucial\u2019s success in these segments.\nAt the 2024 CES, Micron had a couple of interesting USB4 SSD technology demonstrations for its resellers / partners and invited media. These are essentially products under development (with no guarantees that they would make it to the market in their current form). Both products are bridge-based solutions using the ASMedia ASM2464PD USB4 to NVMe accessory controller. The key update over the popular ASM2364 (USB 3.2 Gen 2\u00d72 upstream, and PCIe 3.0 x4 downstream) is the shift to a 40 Gbps USB4 upstream port along with a PCIe 4.0 x4 link downstream. The power delivery component of the Type-C specification is also implemented within the controller.\nThe portable SSD version has a gumstick form-factor, with the transparent casing housing a M.2 2280 SSD \u2013 a 2TB Gen4 Micron 3400 OEM drive in this case.\nThe drive is expected to be passively cooled, with the larger form-factor enabling a thermal performance similar to that of the X10 Pro / X9 Pro. Bridge-based solutions are the standard option for high-performance portable SSDs.\nSimilar configurations (bridge + DRAM-equipped M.2 SSD) such as the SanDisk Extreme PRO v2 (E81) have yielded excellent all-round performance for a wide range of workload types. We expect the same to continue in the USB4 era. That said, vendors like ADATA using the same bridge have opted for active cooling to avoid thermal throttling in their USB4 PSSD. It remains to be seen if this design will remain fanless in its final form (and if it does, thermal performance would be an interesting aspect to analyze).\nThe USB4 desktop SSD is a comparatively unique product. This is an actively cooled design with a small fan, and uses a U.3 SSD inside. Other vendors like OWC have tried multiple M.2 SSDs configured with software RAID in a large-sized enclosure, but this one has a single high-capacity drive (8TB in the sample being demonstrated).\nDesigned for stacking (without daisy-chaining support), the eSSD also requires external power. The drive can also power notebooks through the USB4 connection, which can make up for the presence of a discrete power adapter. Specifics of the power delivery will only be available when the product is officially introduced. This product could be made more attractive by having some downstream USB Type-A / Type-C ports (eSSD in a dock). That said, there are two aspects that will probably make this the performance and consistency king of USB4 SSDs \u2013 the presence of a fan, and the use of a Gen4 U.3 SSD (which is most likely an enterprise drive that advertises worst-case performance and not speeds in the SLC cache region).\nThe current crop of USB4 SSDs are focused on performance, and sacrifice power- and energy-efficiency. Those aspects will be addressed by native USB4 UFD controllers like Phison\u2019s U21. Silicon Motion tends to keep controllers under wraps until reference designs are ready to ship (if the introduction of the SM2320 was anything to go by). We expect external / portable SSD vendors to eventually add native UFD controller-based products to their USB4 lineup, but that seems unlikely to happen in the first half of 2024.\nSource link\nTwo Fabs in Construction, One Awaiting Government Approval\n3nm Revenue Share Jumps to 15%, 5nm Overtakes 7nm For 2023\nApple to Cut Blood Oxygen Feature from Newly-Sold Apple Watches in the U.S.\nLeave A Reply Cancel Reply\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nThis website is all about the technology and science to provide their related topics contents\nThank You\nType above and press Enter to search.
