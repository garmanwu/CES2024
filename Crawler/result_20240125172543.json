It provides lidar-like point clouds with a few hundred meters of detecting range, instant & accurate (ego) velocity info, robustness in adverse weather conditions, and more importantly at a fraction of the cost.\nBy only depicting \"objects\", with roughly 2 orders of magnitudes less of points, Altos V1 delivers similar perception results with extremely high data-efficiency, requesting less compute power from the ADAS system.\u00a0 Thus, we believe, for the first time, a high-performance, reliable and affordable autonomous driving solution can be seen on the horizon.\nDon't take our word for it. Check out the real-time, on-board processed point cloud video below (including a comparison with the Hesai AT128, the best mass-production lidar currently on the market).\nFull Specifications:\nFor More Info and Sample Query, please email: \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0info@altosradar.com"
