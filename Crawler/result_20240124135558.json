The two companies embodied the theme of CES \"Imagine Every Move\" with their CES Innovation Award-winning products that bring autonomous driving to our daily lives. The booth is an open stage, with an LED screen installed at the front of the booths that spreads both horizontally and vertically. It spans a width of 10\u00a0m and a height of 4.5\u00a0m. The CES story video incorporating the present and future of the two companies will be screened on the main stage.\nHL Mando presents \"Parkie,\" winner of the Best Innovation Award. This fully autonomous driving system-equipped parking robot can not only recognize obstacles, roads, and license plate numbers, but also independently determine the size, weight, and type of parked cars. Parkie makes it possible to reduce parking space by up to 30% compared to mechanical parking systems. An additional economic benefit of about 20 percent can also be anticipated. In support of \"autonomous driving in our daily lives,\" HL Mando prepared space in their booth to demonstrate Parkie along with its self-produced module car. MiCOSA, making its debut from HL Mando, is also noteworthy. MiCOSA, boldly entering the mobility market alongside robots, is a data-driven automotive software solution available at the HL Mando booth.\nHL Klemove put forward the Beetle, coming far closer a cutting-edge mobile radar device that is set to revolutionize personal mobility and safety. This compact sensor, no larger than a single AirPods, boasts an impressive detection radius of 20 meters and can be easily synchronized with various devices. It's specifically designed to enhance the safety of smaller mobility aids like bicycles and wheelchairs. The Beetle's ability to provide real-time detection allows users to quickly adapt to unforeseen circumstances, making it an indispensable tool in daily life.\nThe Beetle's remarkable features were highlighted at this year's CES exhibition, where it garnered accolades in two significant categories: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps, and Smart Cities. Additionally, HL Klemove's innovative \"Tire Sync\" technology was recognized for its groundbreaking capabilities. Beyond merely monitoring tire wear and temperature, Tire Sync can assess vehicle load and road conditions, playing a crucial role in preventing traffic accidents by identifying hazards such as black ice and potholes.\nHL Klemove is currently collaborating with a leading global tire company to bring Tire Sync to the market. Moreover, the company is set to unveil a comprehensive autonomous driving solution, centered around its high-performance computer (HPC). This system integrates advanced radar, high-resolution cameras, and sophisticated software, further cementing HL Klemove's position as a frontrunner in automotive safety and innovation.\nHL Mando and HL Klemove booths will be #5466 located in the West Hall.

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

But quality and technology itself are Mando\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vision,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153object\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of improvement. The half-century history of challenges and passion of Mando to secure the only independent domestic technology in a country which lacked automotive parts technology has now turned into a living history of South Korean vehicles, the technology and quality of which are acknowledged in the world market.\nMando will develop into a global company encompassing core parts, which are the basis of safe vehicles, to high value-added future cutting-edge automotive parts, based on talented human resources, cutting-edge technology and production facilities, and leading quality competitiveness.\nExternal link for HL Mando\nLocations\n21, Pangyo-ro 255beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea\nSeongnam-si, KR\nEmployees at HL Mando\nChristian Walter\nMario Breda\nPrasad Narasimha\nDarrell Jeffreys\nUpdates\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nThe parking robot, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 astonished everyone at CES 2024!\u00c2\nThrough parking demonstrations, visitors could directly witness the future of parking solutions.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at CES 2024 is the only Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). It autonomously navigates obstacles, empty spaces, and driveways, recognizing the distance between vehicle wheels and the vehicle's center to move the vehicle. Consequently, it is an innovative technology that efficiently plans and utilizes parking spaces, providing new value.\n01. 30% Increase in Parking Space\nWith Parkie, the standards for mechanical parking lots are applied to automated parking lots, significantly increasing the utility area of the parking lot. Constraints on unnecessary space movement (e.g., forward and backward driving, avoiding oncoming vehicles) disappear when parking is done without human entry into the parking lot. Based on a parking lot with approximately 1,300 parking spaces, it can provide around 390 additional parking spaces.\n02. Narrower Parking Aisles, Lower Ceiling Height\nIntegrating Parkie allows for lowering the height of existing parking garages. With reduced height, additional floors can be secured, enabling the use of these added levels for purposes other than parking, depending on the building's use or location.\n03. Reduction in Parking Infrastructure and Labor Costs\nWhile the construction cost of a conventional parking lot is approximately 1.1 billion for 1,000 parking spaces, using Parkie helps significantly reduce construction costs and valet parking labor expenses.\nThis is how the future parking lots will change with Parkie.\u00c2\nIn the future, Parkie is expected to provide even more benefits through continuous technological advancements, so we ask for your continued interest!\n#HL #HLmando #mobility #award\n#Parkie #Parkingrobot #Best_of_Innovation_Awards #Parking_space_solution\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nCES 2024 X HL Mando\u00c2\nTake an online tour at the remarkable HL Booth from CES 2024 now!\n#HL #HLmando #HLKlemove #mobility\n#CES #Parkie #Parkingrobot #Beetle #Tiresync #MiCOSA\n#Best_of_Innovation_Awards #InnovationAwards\u00c2\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nHL Mando's CES 2024 booth showing innovative future mobility has revealed!\nFrom the demonstration of a parking robot \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to various autonomous driving software technologies were unveiled and caught the attention of many visitors \u00e2\u0153\u00a8\nCheck out future mobility technology featured by HL Mando!\n#HL #Hlmando #HLKlemove #mobility\u00c2\n#CES #Parkie #Parkingrobot #MiCOSA\n#Best_of_Innovation_Awards #InnovationAwards\u00c2\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nOn January 9th, HL Mando and Amazon Web Service (AWS) signed a partnership agreement to develop mobility software to begin the era of Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs).\nHL Mando is focusing its effort on developing self-driving vehicles, and it has developed numerous software products including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mando Integrated Control Software Assembly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (MiCOSA), Holistic Vehicle Dynamic Control (HVDC), and a cloud service platform. With the company wanting to reinforce its software development for self-driving vehicles, its encouraging partnership with AWS will allow HL Mando to develop various self-driving solutions.\nAWS is the leader in the cloud computing and IoT industries with a near real-time IoT data transmission service. HL Mando is developing Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and Road Surface Perception (RSP) functions by integrating the IoT technology of AWS and its MiCOSA software. The partnership will innovate the industry, leading to the beginning of the era of SDVs.\nThe partnership between the two companies will bring enormous changes to the autonomous driving industry!\n#HL #HLmando #mobility #Amazon #AmazonWebService #AWS #Collaboration\n#autonomousdriving #SDV #MiCOSA #HVDC #PHM #RSP #HLMandoXAWS\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nHL Mando\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking robot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parkie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest of Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at CES 2024, the largest IT exhibition in the world held in Las Vegas!\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest of Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is given only to the best of the best applicant products, making it the most honorable achievement for a product at CES. Out of around three thousand products that received the Innovation Award, only about thirty of those are entitled to such an honor.\nThen, why did Parkie deserve such a prestigious award?\nThe parking robot can automate the parking process in conventional drive-in parking lots, increasing the surface area by thirty percent and creating more parking areas.\nFurthermore, Parkie is the only autonomous mobile robot (AMR) in the market that can drive around the parking lot autonomously. The robot identifies obstacles, empty space, and its route to drive through the parking areas and it calculates the distances between wheels and the center of the car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mass to lift vehicles. Parkie does all these without the need for an additional facility or infrastructure.\nHL Mando developed Parkie for the past four years using its autonomous driving technologies and decades of expertise in vehicle manufacturing. Currently, the parking robot is in operation at an office building where various types of cars come and go. By adapting to the environment of the venue, Parkie continues its development to become the optimal parking solution.\nCheck out the future of parking lots led by Parkie.\n#HL #HLmando #mobility #award\n#Parkie #Parkingrobot #Best_of_Innovation_Awards #Parking_space_solution\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nCheck out HL Mando\u00e2\u02c6\u2122HL Klemove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobility technology that will enter in your daily life!\n\u00e2\u2013\u00b6 HL Mando\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking robot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parkie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saves you from the burden of parking during busy mornings and rush hour.\n\u00e2\u2013\u00b6 HL Klemove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precise and safe self-driving solution provides various experiences while driving.\nWatch our CES 2024 promotion video for more information!\nHL Group presents a new paradigm in mobility, an aspiring future of mobility life.\n\u00c2\n#HL #HLmando #HLKlemove #mobility\u00c2\n#CES #Parkie #Parkingrobot #Beetle #Tiresync #MiCOSA\n#Best_of_Innovation_Awards #InnovationAwards\u00c2\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando\nHL Mando and HL Klemove will be participating in CES 2024, the largest IT exhibition in the world, from 9 January to 12 January.\nHL Group received three \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCES Innovation Awards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCES 2024\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n01.

With the company wanting to reinforce its software development for self-driving vehicles, its encouraging partnership with AWS will allow HL Mando to develop various self-driving solutions.\nAWS is the leader in the cloud computing and IoT industries with a near real-time IoT data transmission service. HL Mando is developing Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and Road Surface Perception (RSP) functions by integrating the IoT technology of AWS and its MiCOSA software. The partnership will innovate the industry, leading to the beginning of the era of SDVs.\nThe partnership between the two companies will bring enormous changes to the autonomous driving industry!\n#HL #HLmando #mobility #Amazon #AmazonWebService #AWS #Collaboration\n#autonomousdriving #SDV #MiCOSA #HVDC #PHM #RSP #HLMandoXAWS\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nMore Relevant Posts\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nThe parking robot, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 astonished everyone at CES 2024!\u00c2\nThrough parking demonstrations, visitors could directly witness the future of parking solutions.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at CES 2024 is the only Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). It autonomously navigates obstacles, empty spaces, and driveways, recognizing the distance between vehicle wheels and the vehicle's center to move the vehicle. Consequently, it is an innovative technology that efficiently plans and utilizes parking spaces, providing new value.\n01. 30% Increase in Parking Space\nWith Parkie, the standards for mechanical parking lots are applied to automated parking lots, significantly increasing the utility area of the parking lot. Constraints on unnecessary space movement (e.g., forward and backward driving, avoiding oncoming vehicles) disappear when parking is done without human entry into the parking lot. Based on a parking lot with approximately 1,300 parking spaces, it can provide around 390 additional parking spaces.\n02. Narrower Parking Aisles, Lower Ceiling Height\nIntegrating Parkie allows for lowering the height of existing parking garages. With reduced height, additional floors can be secured, enabling the use of these added levels for purposes other than parking, depending on the building's use or location.\n03. Reduction in Parking Infrastructure and Labor Costs\nWhile the construction cost of a conventional parking lot is approximately 1.1 billion for 1,000 parking spaces, using Parkie helps significantly reduce construction costs and valet parking labor expenses.\nThis is how the future parking lots will change with Parkie.\u00c2\nIn the future, Parkie is expected to provide even more benefits through continuous technological advancements, so we ask for your continued interest!\n#HL #HLmando #mobility #award\n#Parkie #Parkingrobot #Best_of_Innovation_Awards #Parking_space_solution\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nCES 2024 X HL Mando\u00c2\nTake an online tour at the remarkable HL Booth from CES 2024 now!\n#HL #HLmando #HLKlemove #mobility\n#CES #Parkie #Parkingrobot #Beetle #Tiresync #MiCOSA\n#Best_of_Innovation_Awards #InnovationAwards\u00c2\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nHL Mando's CES 2024 booth showing innovative future mobility has revealed!\nFrom the demonstration of a parking robot \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcParkie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to various autonomous driving software technologies were unveiled and caught the attention of many visitors \u00e2\u0153\u00a8\nCheck out future mobility technology featured by HL Mando!\n#HL #Hlmando #HLKlemove #mobility\u00c2\n#CES #Parkie #Parkingrobot #MiCOSA\n#Best_of_Innovation_Awards #InnovationAwards\u00c2\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n24,849 followers\n#TogetherMando #CES2024 #IMAGINE_EVERY_MOVE\nHL Mando\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking robot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parkie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd won the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest of Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at CES 2024, the largest IT exhibition in the world held in Las Vegas!\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBest of Innovation Award\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is given only to the best of the best applicant products, making it the most honorable achievement for a product at CES. Out of around three thousand products that received the Innovation Award, only about thirty of those are entitled to such an honor.\nThen, why did Parkie deserve such a prestigious award?\nThe parking robot can automate the parking process in conventional drive-in parking lots, increasing the surface area by thirty percent and creating more parking areas.\nFurthermore, Parkie is the only autonomous mobile robot (AMR) in the market that can drive around the parking lot autonomously. The robot identifies obstacles, empty space, and its route to drive through the parking areas and it calculates the distances between wheels and the center of the car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mass to lift vehicles. Parkie does all these without the need for an additional facility or infrastructure.\nHL Mando developed Parkie for the past four years using its autonomous driving technologies and decades of expertise in vehicle manufacturing.

This marked Sprout\u2019s 20th time attending CES and, each year, we are left buzzing with inspiration from the show.\nIn this recap, we explore six themes that defined CES 2024, offering a glimpse into some of the innovative technologies that stood out at the show and are shaping our future.\nSustainability Takes Center Stage: A Collective Push\nAt the forefront of CES 2024 was a resounding emphasis on sustainability, underscoring a growing commitment to eco-friendly practices across all industries. The Consumer Technology Association kicked off the show by introducing the Consumer Technology Circularity Initiative, urging tech companies to reduce their climate impact through increased recycling and a commitment to responsible device disposal. The pledge, signed by industry giants like Lenovo, LG, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony, demonstrates a collective push toward a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future. The tech industry\u2019s heightened awareness of its impact on climate change was evident as many exhibitors chose to spotlight the composition of products and the expanding use of recycled materials.\nAutonomous Machinery: Cultivating Innovation and Efficiency\nAgricultural giants Kubota and Doosan Bobcat both introduced autonomous machinery, a significant leap in ag tech innovation. Hyundai showcased its AI-powered Concept X excavator as part of a larger vision called Xite Transformation, aimed at revolutionizing the construction industry with technology. Combining automation, AI, and electrification, these machines will digitally transform the way critical tasks are carried out.\nElectric Vehicles: Charged Up for the Future of Transportation\nHonda had a strong showing and received buzz for the world premiere of their 0 Series concept models, Saloon and Space-Hub, widely acclaimed as the sexiest EVs at CES. A favorite from Honda was the sleek, simple, ultra-compact electric scooter, Motocompacto. Kia unveiled its anticipated modular electric vehicle lineup, called the Platform Behind Vehicle (PBV). Kia PBVs are highly customizable, featuring interchangeable electric powertrains and vehicle tops. LG Innotek introduced a range of technologies for autonomous driving vehicles, including a software-defined (SDV) vehicle that incorporates a driver monitoring system (DMS) camera with the capabilities including emitting a loud warning if signs of drowsy driving, such as closed eyes, are detected. Adding to vehicle innovation, HL Mando, a Korean automobile company, debuted the world\u2019s first autonomous car-parking robot called Parkie.\nWellness and Health Tech: Accessible and Impactful\nThere was a marked shift in the landscape of wellness and health tech, making impactful solutions more accessible. French tech innovator Withings unveiled the BeamO, a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d resembling a Wii that is capable of measuring temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels, and functioning as a stethoscope\u2014all in one compact device. Ceragem\u2019s MASTER Medical Bed features a modularized design equipped with a spinal thermal massager and compatibility with various medical devices, catering to individual user needs. CES also showcased several Smart Rings like the Evie by Movano, specifically designed for women\u2019s health, encompassing menstrual, sleep, heart rate, and activity tracking, with an open design accommodating natural changes in women\u2019s body sizes. Underscoring the intersection of beauty and technology, L\u2019Oreal delivered the first-ever keynote from a beauty company. CEO Nicolas Hieronimus discussed sustainable, accessible, and inclusive tech innovations that are shaping the future of the beauty industry.\nAge Tech: Innovations for an Aging Population\nWith a historic high in the number of Americans turning 65, Age Tech was a prominent theme at CES 2024. Introduced by AARP last year, the AgeTech Collaborative connects startups, enterprises, investors, and industry experts to address the needs and challenges of the aging population. A few standout products that caught our eye include a stylish, high-tech hospital-like bed and a hand-stabilization glove. The Dawn House Bed, created by Ergomotion comes with customizable features like adjustable height, support rails, underbed lighting, voice command, remote control, and health monitoring capabilities, ensuring both comfort and health are prioritized. Gyrogear\u2019s GyroGlove utilizes advanced gyroscopic stabilization to combat hand tremors, helping those struggling with diseases like Parkinson\u2019s regain some independence and control.\nRobots and AI: The Rise of Smart Companions\nThe proliferation of robots and AI demonstrated the versatility and growth of robotic technology. Robots are no longer confined to industrial spaces; they are our companions, our entertainment, and can complete most household tasks at this point. Notably, lawn-mowing robotics were all over, with several vendors showing their autonomous systems. Segway debuted the Navimow in the US for the first time. The robot lawnmower uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard. Both Samsung and LG showcased robotic smart home managers capable of not only controlling all of your devices throughout your home but also recognizing and adjusting to changes detected in the people and pets who occupy the space. In another innovative use of AI, Swarovski Optik collaborated with Marc Newson to design AX VISIO, the world\u2019s first AI-supported binoculars that utilize high-performance analog long-range optics and digital intelligence to detect and identify more than 9,000 birds and other wildlife at the touch of a button.\nKeyShot Designer Night: Co-Hosted by Sprout\nAnother huge highlight of our time at CES was KeyShot Designer Night. Sprout was thrilled to co-host this year\u2019s event with Luxion, gathering many of our friends, clients, and colleagues from across the design industry. We packed the venue and had a great time! It was wonderful to see so many familiar faces and meet many others. Shoutout to everyone who dropped by \u2013\u00a0you made our CES unforgettable!\nThe excitement from CES 2024 has set the stage for a busy year.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nA New 'Barbie' Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie's Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nOne of the Best 4K Projector TVs Is On Sale Ahead of Your Super Bowl Viewing Party\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nWhere to Stream the 2024 Oscar-Nominated Films Online\nTory Burch x Humberto Leon\u2019s New L.A.

The two companies embodied the theme of CES \"Imagine Every Move\" with their CES Innovation Award-winning products that bring autonomous driving to our daily lives. The booth is an open stage, with an LED screen installed at the front of the booths that spreads both horizontally and vertically. It spans a width of 10 m and a height of 4.5 m. The CES story video incorporating the present and future of the two companies will be screened on the main stage.HL Mando presents \"Parkie,\" winner of the Best Innovation Award. This fully autonomous driving system-equipped parking robot can not only recognize obstacles, roads, and license plate numbers, but also independently determine the size, weight, and type of parked cars. Parkie makes it possible to reduce parking space by up to 30% compared to mechanical parking systems. An additional economic benefit of about 20 percent can also be anticipated. In support of \"autonomous driving in our daily lives,\" HL Mando prepared space in their booth to demonstrate Parkie along with its self-produced module car. MiCOSA, making its debut from HL Mando, is also noteworthy. MiCOSA, boldly entering the mobility market alongside robots, is a data-driven automotive software solution available at the HL Mando booth.HL Klemove put forward the Beetle, coming far closer a cutting-edge mobile radar device that is set to revolutionize personal mobility and safety. This compact sensor, no larger than a single AirPods, boasts an impressive detection radius of 20 meters and can be easily synchronized with various devices. It's specifically designed to enhance the safety of smaller mobility aids like bicycles and wheelchairs. The Beetle's ability to provide real-time detection allows users to quickly adapt to unforeseen circumstances, making it an indispensable tool in daily life.The Beetle's remarkable features were highlighted at this year's CES exhibition, where it garnered accolades in two significant categories: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps, and Smart Cities. Additionally, HL Klemove's innovative \"Tire Sync\" technology was recognized for its groundbreaking capabilities. Beyond merely monitoring tire wear and temperature, Tire Sync can assess vehicle load and road conditions, playing a crucial role in preventing traffic accidents by identifying hazards such as black ice and potholes.\nHL Klemove is currently collaborating with a leading global tire company to bring Tire Sync to the market. Moreover, the company is set to unveil a comprehensive autonomous driving solution, centered around its high-performance computer (HPC). This system integrates advanced radar, high-resolution cameras, and sophisticated software, further cementing HL Klemove's position as a frontrunner in automotive safety and innovation.HL Mando and HL Klemove booths will be #5466 located in the West Hall.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: truly all the tech you need and then some\nThe best tech of CES 2024, from next-level laptops to mindful mirrors, audacious audio and more innovation than you can shake a smart bot at\nCES 2024 \u2013 the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 has left the Las Vegas Convention centre for another year, so it\u2019s time to reflect on the chaos, hype and bluster of the event. Did anything truly deliver on technology\u2019s evergreen promise of a better future? Here\u2019s our selection of gadgets with promise and desirable devices, as well as the occasional curveball from the future that didn\u2019t quite convince. Around 1,400 different start-ups vied for attention alongside established brands, old and new, an indication of how hardware has become the new software.\nVoyage MagSafe charger by Native Union\nWhether or not this means there\u2019s a bubble in need of bursting is another matter. The current trend for injecting AI into everything from cars to dog wellbeing products shows the breadth of enthusiasm for the technology, even if its actual aims and benefits are harder to discern. Likewise, the domestic robotics industry is still waiting for its killer app.\nHP Spectre Fold Laptop\nThis year, there was even a \u2018Gallery of Flops\u2019, a self-referential Salon des Refus\u00e9s of commercially catastrophic ideas. Although most of the featured products were little more than tiny bumps in the road for major corporations (the Microsoft Zune, Amazon\u2019s Fire Phone, the Nintendo Virtual Boy), start-ups see shows like CES as very much a life or death situation. We\u2019ve already reported from CES 2024 to delve into the car industry\u2019s many and varied takes on tomorrow\u2019s tech, as well as the fast-growing beauty tech market. Scroll down to see our broader selection of the ideas and products that caught our eye, from wearables to smart mirrors, laptops and loudspeakers.\nCES 2024: New tech for the home of tomorrow\nSamsung Robot Vacuum Cleaner\nScrub up: Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\nRobotic vacuum cleaners have been a staple of tech shows for decades and are still the most successful and practical kind of domestic droid. If you\u2019ve the right kind of space (open and uncluttered), then devices like Samsung\u2019s new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo are a perfect match. The ubiquitous AI features include the ability to detect different flooring types and switch between scrubbing, sweeping and sucking depending on the surface, as well as a stain-detecting system. If the little puck-like Bot finds a dubious mark, it\u2019ll scuttle back to its clean station to heat its spinning mop pads and then return to tackle the problem.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, available soon, Samsung.com\nAirthings Renew\nIt's a breeze: Renew air purifier by Airthings\nQuiet and unimposing, just as you\u2019d hope, the new Airthings Renew air purifier is perfect for bedrooms and home offices. The compact grey cube was designed in Norway and has the power to filter out up to 99.7 per cent of fine airborne particles. It also syncs with the Airthings app to help you track, trace and clean up the quality of your indoor air.\nAirthings Renew air purifier, \u00a3349.99, Airthings.com\nAnura MagicMirror from NuraLogix\nLooking glass: Anura MagicMirror\nDesigned to works in harmony with the Canadian company\u2019s Anura app, which apparently provides \u2018medical-grade measurements using data gathered from a 30-second video selfie\u2019, the MagicMirror is a digital fit-check for your mental state. Meditech companies often claim far-reaching diagnostic capabilities, but if it works, the rectangular mirror requires you to sit still and gaze into its 21.5-inch screen; beneath the surface are AI-powered sensors that\u2019ll run a report on your vital signs.\nAnura MagicMirror, concept only, Nuralogix.ai\nBMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMirror, mirror on the wall: BMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMore about mindfulness than raw analytics, the BMind Smart Mirror is intended to give you a lift, not probe your inner workings. More AI is at play, sifting through a database of expressions and gestures to get a sense of how you appear to be and respond with light, sound and projected display. Described as an \u2018AI-driven virtual mindfulness coach\u2019, it\u2019s a fairytale device brought to life.\nBaracoda BMind Smart Mirror, concept only, Baracoda.com\nLG\u2019s Smart Home AI agent\nSmart bot: LG Smart Home AI Agent\nLG\u2019s Labs division crammed a lot of smart home devices into its CES 2024 display, including its Bon Voyage camping trailer.

Lotus\u2019 Ring is perhaps the simplest of the lot. This finger-borne controller doesn\u2019t monitor or measure; it simply controls. Using the same infrared technology as a traditional television remote control, users need to install special light-switch covers. After this, they can simply point at the switch to turn it on or off. Rather than see this as a contemporary version of the Clapper, the company is pitching the Ring as an accessibility aid.\nLotus Ring, GetLotus.com\nCreator Keyboard by Clicks\nSmart phones: Creator Keyboard by Clicks\nThe Creator Keyboard from Clicks urges you to step back into the distant days of the Blackberry. Essentially an iPhone case with a built-in physical backlit keyboard, the Creator should find favour with anyone who has never quite got the hang of touchscreens, as well as the retro crowd.

When not in use, the Voyage snaps together into a circular form factor that\u2019s perfect for travelling.\nVoyage, price tbc, NativeUnion.com\nUltraHuman Home\nInfo source: UltraHuman Home hub\nThe Ultrahuman Home is a domestic dock for the company\u2019s Ring AIR, a wearable health monitor system. While the Ring AIR can track movement and sleep, the Home adds environmental data, including light and air quality, noise levels, temperature and humidity.

The folding 17-inch screen wraps around the neat wireless keyboard; it can be detached to use on its own as a large touchscreen tablet. Dock the keyboard on the lower screen and the Spectre Fold looks like a conventional laptop.

Everyone will be able to get a glimpse of HL Mando and HL Klemove technology trends through street dances that have no boundaries. The new technologies, along with the future vision of both companies, will be separately released in the exhibition display zone.\nHL Mando has decorated its exhibition area centering around the e-corner module (electronic corner module) of the company (photo). The e-corner module is the culmination of the electrification system, combining brakes, steering, suspension parts, and the vehicle drive motor. HL Mando created the e-corner module thanks to its experience of developing the \"X-by-Wire (*SbW, *BbW)\". Its application is considerably extensive, ranging from the obvious small, middle, and large-size vehicles to small and large delivery robots to eco-friendly multi-purpose mobilities (*PBV). The e-corner module's advantage is its 4-wheel independent steering method, enabling once impossible concepts, such as parallel (perpendicular) parking and u-turn in place. The e-corner module, *EMB, and SbW system will all be available for real-life viewing at the site of the event. Meanwhile, HL Mando's spinoff technology will also add to the existing fun. You will be able to experience other electrified products, including the e-cargo (last mile mobility), patrol robots, and parking robots, through various videos.\nMeanwhile, the phrase 'Clever Move Zone' was derived from the company's name, \"HL Klemove\". The word \"Klemove\" is a combination of the words \"Clever\" and \"Move\". The company, which pursues to deliver a 'clever mobility system', will showcase a diverse lineup of solutions at the upcoming CES, ranging from autonomous driving Level 2+ to Level 4 products. The lineup will include a high-performance radar that more than doubles the existing detection range through the application of a 3D antenna, an ultra-high resolution camera that supports wireless update (OTA) and *DCU as well as *Zonal ECU that provide a next-generation Centralized Architecture. The Level 4 auto shuttle driving video, the epitome of HL Klemove's autonomous driving solutions, will be released for the first time at CES 2023, on January 5th.\nDuring the tech event, cutting-edge software enterprises, such as Argus and Sonatus, are expected to make an appearance at the HL Mando booth. Argus is the world's top mobility cyber security company, and Sonatus is a big data solution company that focuses on cloud-based vehicles. The HL Mando and HL Klemove booth will be located at the West Hall of the CES exhibit site in Las Vegas, US.

        "raw_content": "ESPN\nAs the Washington Football Team's QB quest enters Year 29, ESPN Analytics ranks its past 30 starters\nASHBURN, Va. -- On Sunday, Ryan Fitzpatrick became the Washington Football Team's 31st starting quarterback since Mark Rypien left the lineup in Week 2 of the 1993 season.\nFitzpatrick left Washington's 20-16 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers with a hip injury after attempting six passes and was placed on injured reserve with a chance to return later this season. Backup Taylor Heinicke was named the starter for Thursday's game against the visiting New York Giants (8:20 p.m. ET, NFL Network), a situation that is emblematic of the franchise's quest for a long-term answer at the position.\nIt's a 29-year search that has featured bad timing, worse luck and questionable decisions.\nRypien, who led the team to victory in Super Bowl XXVI after the 1991 season, started 26 games over the next two years but never rekindled his winning magic. Washington has since used first-round draft picks on five quarterbacks (Heath Shuler, Patrick Ramsey, Jason Campbell, Robert Griffin III and Dwayne Haskins), acquired three who started in Super Bowls for other teams (Jeff Hostetler, Donovan McNabb and Rex Grossman), and watched two others (Brad Johnson and Rich Gannon) do so after leaving the team. It also had a transformative quarterback (Griffin) who starred as a rookie, got hurt and was gone from the franchise three years later.\nEditor's Picks\nTaylor Heinicke is a 'tough dude' who energizes Washington Football Team2yJohn Keim\nFantasy fallout: Deebo Samuel is for real; Elijah Mitchell is 'for now'2yMike Triplett\nWhy the New York Giants remain all-in on Daniel Jones as QB12yJordan Raanan\nAs Washington closes on the 30th anniversary of its last Super Bowl win, ESPN set out to rank the 30 quarterbacks who started for the franchise between Rypien and Fitzpatrick, to provide context about the search for a leader that has touched four decades.\nAs a reporter who has covered 28 of the 30 players on this list -- and after interviewing nearly two dozen people, including former Washington coaches and teammates -- arriving at an irrefutable ranking for me was challenging. Several of these quarterbacks barely touched the field with Washington, while others faced obstacles such as coaching staffs that didn't want them, schemes that didn't fit their talents or injuries.\nWe enlisted the help of ESPN Analytics to apply a sense of order. That ranking (explained below) isn't perfect, but it does highlight the volatility of Washington's quest.\nNo quarterback since Rypien has made more than 60 starts for this franchise. Only two -- Kirk Cousins and Jason Campbell -- topped 50 starts, and 12 made five or fewer. Heck, receiver Terry McLaurin has played 30 games in Washington and caught passes from seven quarterbacks.\nMORE: A timeline of Washington Football Team's controversy and comebacks\nDuring Washington's search, its NFC East rivals have enjoyed long stretches of stability at the position. The Dallas Cowboys have had three quarterbacks (Troy Aikman, Tony Romo and Dak Prescott) start at least 70 games; Eli Manning started 234 for the New York Giants; and from 2000 to 2012, the Philadelphia Eagles had Donovan McNabb (10 seasons) and Michael Vick (three seasons) combine for 172 starts over that span.\nThe turnover has hurt the quality of QB play for Washington, which has had two postseason wins since Rypien's last full season in 1992. Nobody knew the frustration better than right tackle Jon Jansen, who played with 10 starting quarterbacks from 1999 to 2008.\n\"[When there's] constant change at quarterback,\" Jansen said, \"you don't ever get a chance to develop a rhythm and develop the relationship you need on the field.\"\nHere is our analytics-based ranking, presented in order from the back of the pack at No. 30 to the best at No. 1. Included are thoughts from ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. on the five QBs who were first-round draft picks by Washington.\nNote: ESPN Analytics ranked the QBs according to a combination of regular-season passing efficiency (yards per attempt), weighted 75%, and total passing yards, weighted 25%. Players with few appearances (fewer than 1,000 passing yards) were ranked below those with more significant appearances and sorted solely by total passing yards. To account for the changing nature of the NFL's passing game, yardage and efficiency were adjusted according to the years in which they occurred.\n* Games and record totals include playoff appearances with Washington.\n30. Mark Sanchez (2018)\nGames: 2 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 0 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 138\nWithin two weeks of signing, he became the starter after Colt McCoy was injured. Sanchez's lone start was disastrous: He completed 6 of 14 passes for 38 yards and two interceptions. He was benched for the second half and never played in the NFL again.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 28 but acknowledge that his one half was one of the worst in recent memory.\n29. Taylor Heinicke (2020-present)*\nGames: 3 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 259\nOn Dec. 7, he was a student at Old Dominion taking math classes. A day later he signed with Washington, and a month later he started a playoff game against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Heinicke entered the 2021 season as Fitzpatrick's backup, with a multiyear contract and strong fan support. He has an opportunity to climb this list, starting Thursday.\nKeim's take: There's no doubt he belongs higher, but this is indicative of how few snaps he has taken in Washington.\n28. Cary Conklin (1990-93)\nGames: 5 | Record: 0-2 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 512\nConklin, a fourth-round draft pick in 1990, appeared in seven NFL games, including two with the San Francisco 49ers. His lone starts occurred during Washington's 1993 season, when it finished 4-12.\nKeim's take: I'm fine with him here.\n27. Josh Johnson (2018)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 590\nBecause of multiple injuries, Johnson made his first start 11 days after signing in December 2018. Said former coach Jay Gruden: \"We knew he could run. He wasn't the greatest passer, but he had a skill the other guys didn't have. [Mark] Sanchez had more experience but couldn't move.\"\nJohnson learned his Washington teammates by playing the Madden video game after signing.\nKeim's take: Too low for me; I would have put him at No. 21.\n26. Kyle Allen (2020-present)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 4 | INTs: 1 | Pass yards: 610\nIn his four starts, he posted a Total QBR of 70 or better three times. Washington had only one other quarterback (Alex Smith) post a 70 rating or better in 2020. A broken ankle ended Allen's season.\nKeim's take: He was better than a few players ahead of him, which is why I would have ranked him No. 19.\n25. Rich Gannon (1993)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 704\nGannon wasn't healthy in Washington.\n\"I told him, 'I could sit flat-footed and throw the ball farther than you,'\" said former running back Brian Mitchell, who played quarterback in college. \"When he played here, he did not have the same arm he did when he was in Oakland. It was nowhere close.\"\nHere's why: Gannon needed shoulder surgery and missed all of 1994. From 1999 to 2002, he led the Raiders to a Super Bowl, was named NFL MVP once, earned All-Pro twice and threw 105 touchdowns to 44 interceptions.\nKeim's take: Close; I would have ranked him No. 24, so there's agreement on his lack of effectiveness with Washington.\n24. Danny Wuerffel (2002)\nGames: 7 | Record: 2-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 719\nThe beginning of the end for coach Steve Spurrier in Washington occurred when the front office, against his strong wishes, cut Wuerffel before the 2003 season. Spurrier was shown statistics the night before cuts to convince him it was the right move. Wuerffel never played again.\nKeim's take: He just didn't have the arm to play in the NFL.\n23. John Beck (2011)\nGames: 4 | Record: 0-3 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 858\nFormer coach Mike Shanahan once said he would stand on a table to advocate for Beck. Players would not. During the 2011 lockout, Beck organized workouts.\nMore Than An Athlete: Michael Strahan\nFrom modest beginnings abroad, to NFL football superstardom, to media mogul, explore how Michael Strahan redefined the possibilities for modern athletes. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid former Washington tight end Chris Cooley: \"What I remember is he called everyone and said, 'This is John Beck, your starting quarterback.' We all called each other and said, 'Is he the starting QB or just saying that?' I didn't hate the confidence.\"\nBut it didn't translate to games. His last two starts were disasters: He was sacked 10 times in a shutout loss against the Buffalo Bills because he wouldn't throw the ball.\n\"He panicked,\" Cooley said.\nThe next week he dumped the ball off to running back Roy Helu 14 times and averaged 5.4 yards per pass attempt. In those games, Beck posted Total QBRs of 11.3 and 25.8, respectively.\n\"He thought he was going to be the guy,\" former receiver Santana Moss said. \"He sucked ass; I won't lie to you. I broke my hand and didn't play the [final two] games with him. Nothing better could have happened to me, because I didn't have to play with this guy. ... You talk all this stuff in the offseason and lay this egg.\"\nBeck never played again but has transformed himself into a quarterback teacher, training players for the NFL.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 30 based on the eye test and also with input from a number of ex-players.\n22. Jeff Hostetler (1997)\nGames: 6 | Record: 2-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 899\nThe former Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants finished his 12-year career by starting the last three games of 1997. His lone defeat was a crushing four-interception, 30-10 loss to the Giants in Week 16.\nKeim's take: This is the right area for him.\n21. Shane Matthews (2002)\nGames: 8 | Record: 3-4 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 1,251\nOne week after scoring 14 points in a win, Spurrier was determined to prove the value of his passing game. In a return to Florida for Spurrier and Matthews, facing the Jacksonville Jaguars' No. 21-ranked run defense and No. 13 pass defense, Matthews threw 50 passes and Washington lost by 19. In seven starts, he completed under half of his throws four times.\nKeim's take: Like Hostetler, Matthews is ranked where he needs to be.\n20. Tim Hasselbeck (2003-04)\nGames: 7 | Record: 1-4 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,012\nHe recorded the only 0.0 passer rating in franchise history, completing 6 of 26 passes for 56 yards with four interceptions in a 27-0 loss to Dallas. But that was sandwiched between games in which he had ratings of 128 and 116.9.\nKeim's take: That 0.0 game stands out, which is why some pegged him last. For me, he would be ranked No. 29.\n19. Dwayne Haskins (2019-20)\nGames: 16 | Record: 3-10 | TDs: 12 | INTs: 14 | Pass yards: 2,804\nWashington had him rated as a third-round draft pick in 2019, but multiple sources said higher-ups made them give Haskins a first-round grade and the team drafted him No. 15 overall. It was a bad marriage: Washington's staff needed to win, but Haskins needed time to mature.\nHis game didn't improve, and his maturity level was an issue for two coaching staffs and the front office. He missed one victory formation snap because he was taking a picture with a fan; he didn't study the way the coaches wanted; he was fined multiple times in 2020 for violating COVID-19 protocols, stripped of his captaincy and eventually cut.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 25, but some of that ranking stems from the disappointing way he approached being an NFL quarterback.\nKiper's take on Haskins (2019 first-round draft pick, No. 15 overall): He's a pocket guy, big strong-armed guy. It made sense: local guy sliding down. He fell in their lap. It's like Mac Jones falling in New England's lap or Aaron Rodgers falling into Green Bay's lap. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\nI don't think you can look back and say it was a horrible pick. In hindsight, yeah, but not when it was made. There were always questions with Dwayne: Are you going to be the first one in the building, the last one out? How much does he love the game? Does he study the game? What kind of leader is he? How do his teammates feel about him?\n18. Alex Smith (2018-20)\nGames: 18 | Record: 11-5 | TDs: 16 | INTs: 13 | Pass yards: 3,762\nThe key stat: During his time in Washington, the team was 6-27 when he didn't start. Washington was 6-3 when he suffered his broken fibula and tibia in 2018, then lost 18 of the next 22 games.\n\"Take any franchise and take away Derek Carr, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and see what happens to them,\" Gruden said of losing Smith. \"Not many teams can recover.\"\nSmith's improbable return in 2020 helped deliver an NFC East title as the team went 5-1 in games he started (and 2-8 when he didn't).\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him in the top five. He and Mark Brunell were similar, so this is way too low for Smith.\n17. Heath Shuler (1994-96)\nGames: 19 | Record: 4-9 | TDs: 13 | INTs: 19 | Pass yards: 2,403\nWashington selected him at No. 3 in 1994 instead of Trent Dilfer (No. 6 overall) because of his mobility, even though it had Dilfer rated higher. Shuler's new teammates were not impressed.\nEli's Places\nEli Manning takes on his own version of his brother's signature show to explore what makes college football a way of life across the country. Join Eli as he travels to some of the most well-known and historic college football establishments and meets with giants in the sport to better understand what makes college football such a national sensation. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid Mitchell: \"We played a game in Kansas City [in 1995], and we called a waggle pass. He called it the wrong way, and it got f---ed up in the backfield. I was asked by a coach why I didn't help him out, and I said, 'If you want to pay me quarterback money, I'll call plays and play quarterback.'\"\nAfter the 1996 season, the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints called about a trade. The Packers were coached by Mike Holmgren, and Washington's front office told Shuler it would be a better fit: He could learn and rebuild his game. Shuler wanted to play immediately and chose the Saints and coach Mike Ditka. He started nine games, suffered a serious foot injury and never played again.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 15, but this ranking by ESPN Analytics probably better reflects his performance. However, he should never be ahead of Smith.\nKiper's take on Shuler (1994 first-round draft pick, No. 3 overall): Second-guessing the Heath pick? You can't do it now. I got it wrong. I had no problem with Washington taking him at that point. If I was the Colts [at No. 5], I would have taken Trent Dilfer. Trent turned out to be a lot better than Heath, but I don't think you can question that pick.\n16. Case Keenum (2019)\nGames: 10 | Record: 1-7 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 5 | Pass yards: 1,707\nHe ended up starting in 2019 because McCoy was hurt and Haskins wasn't ready. He's a quality NFL backup with 75 career touchdown passes to 47 interceptions.\nKeim's take: No problem with this ranking of Keenum.\n15. Tony Banks (2001)\nGames: 15 | Record: 8-6 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 2,386\nHe became the surprise starter when Jeff George was waived after two games in 2001. Banks helped turn an 0-5 start into an 8-8 finish under coach Marty Schottenheimer. He played three more seasons with the Houston Texans, starting three games.\nKeim's take: Like Allen, he was better than several players ranked above him here, which is why I would have ranked him ninth.\n14. Jeff George (2000-01)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 7 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,557\nWashington signed George despite a stellar 1999 season by Brad Johnson. George's name had come up the previous offseason, but one source said it was a unanimous \"no.\" The only change in 2000 was the new owner, Dan Snyder; George was signed. In 2000, coach Norv Turner resisted pressure to play George until Johnson was hurt.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him about No. 20 because he just wasn't good with Washington.\n13. Rex Grossman (2010-12)\nGames: 17 | Record: 6-10 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 24 | Pass yards: 4,035\nAfter being benched in 2011, Grossman tried to limit risky throws. But he said he told himself, in essence, this is just who I am, so the \"gutsy\" throws returned.\n\"I really enjoyed Rex, but he could keep both teams in the game,\" Mike Shanahan said. \"He could win a game; he also could lose a game.\"\nKeim's take: Anywhere from No. 10 to No. 13 is good for Grossman.\n12. Mark Brunell (2004-06)*\nGames: 37 | Record: 16-19 | TDs: 38 | INTs: 20 | Pass yards: 6,033\nWashington traded a third-round pick for the 33-year-old Brunell in coach Joe Gibbs' first season back. Brunell wasn't flashy, but in 2005 he helped lead the team to a playoff berth -- and its last postseason win. A highlight: two touchdown passes in the final four minutes to Moss in a 14-13 Monday night win in Dallas.\n\"I liked Mark Brunell,\" Moss said. \"He had that veteran sense; he knew how to win.\"\nKeim's take: No. I would have ranked him at least No. 6, and I could be persuaded into putting him one or two spots higher. Strong leader, overcame an inefficient scheme.\n11. John Friesz (1994)\nGames: 16 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,266\nHe served as the bridge QB to Shuler and Frerotte. It took four games to cross that bridge, and Friesz never started again in Washington, though he did play six more NFL seasons.\nKeim's take: No. 11 is a little high for Friesz, but only by perhaps three spots. He liked to push it down the field and averaged 7.0 yards per pass attempt.\n10. Trent Green (1995-98)\nGames: 16 | Record: 6-8 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 11 | Pass yards: 3,441\nGreen, cut in the CFL in 1994, finally got his chance in 1998 and won six of his last nine starts. But he was a free agent and, because Washington's franchise was for sale, the trustees would not let the team give signing bonuses.\nNFL PrimeTime on ESPN+\nChris Berman and Booger McFarland recap the weekend's games with extended highlights and analysis.\nThe show will stream live at 7:30 p.m. ET each Sunday during the season and will be available on demand each week until late Wednesday night. Watch on ESPN+\nFinally, on the eve of free agency, Washington received permission to make an offer. Too late; Green had already agreed to a deal with St. Louis.\n\"Trent was better than any f---ing quarterback we had here,\" said Mitchell, who played with Washington from 1990 to 1999. \"He might have been the best quarterback we've had in this franchise as far as overall ability since Mark Rypien.\"\nKeim's take: I would have moved him five spots higher and would be OK with him anywhere in the top eight, but he shouldn't be behind the five quarterbacks immediately ahead of him on this list. Never.\n9. Todd Collins (2006-09)*\nGames: 9 | Record: 3-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 1,032\nAfter safety Sean Taylor died in 2007, Washington won its last four games -- including all of Collins' starts in place of the injured Jason Campbell. Collins had not started a game in 10 years, throwing 27 passes during that span, but was well-versed in coordinator Al Saunders' system after spending five years with him in Kansas City.\nKeim's take: I would have pushed him a few spots lower, but you can't understate the impact he had during that late stretch run.\n8. Patrick Ramsey (2002-05)\nGames: 33 | Record: 10-14 | TDs: 34 | INTs: 29 | Pass yards: 5,649\nWashington traded back twice in the first round and drafted Ramsey with the No. 32 pick in 2002 despite Spurrier saying he had never met with him. At the time, one source said the coaching staff and front office did not tell Snyder the QB they were targeting, fearing he would leak it to the media.\nIn his first two starts, blitzed often, Ramsey was sacked 13 times and hit countless others as the offense rarely used max protection.\n\"Those quarterbacks were done a disservice,\" Jansen said.\nKeim's take: He should not be in the top 10, but somewhere around No. 12 makes sense.\nKiper's take on Ramsey (2002 first-round draft pick, No. 32 overall): His biggest issue was he didn't have mobility. He was like a 4.99, 5.0-flat guy [in the 40-yard dash]. He was a decent athlete, but that puts a lot of pressure on the [offensive] line. ... Tough, smart kid, and in the right system, I thought he could flourish.\"\n7. Colt McCoy (2014-19)\nGames: 12 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 8 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,679\nInjuries always derailed McCoy's opportunities. He had the job at the end of 2014 before injuring his neck. He got another chance after Smith's injury in 2018 but broke his right leg in his second start, leading to multiple issues and still impacting him in 2019, when he started just one game.\nKeim's take: McCoy is a smart player but was hurt too often and didn't win when he played, so No. 7 is way too high. He belongs somewhere in the middle at best, and others would argue lower.\n6. Donovan McNabb (2010)\nGames: 13 | Record: 5-8 | TDs: 14 | INTs: 15 | Pass yards: 3,377\nThe coaches wanted Marc Bulger but ended up with McNabb after an Easter Sunday trade in 2010. It did not work out. McNabb was removed late in one game -- for conditioning -- and was benched for the final three games. McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan engaged in a public spat. Perhaps the low point: On Nov. 15, Washington gave McNabb a mostly hollow five-year extension worth nearly $80 million. There was a news conference before a Monday night game against his old team, the Eagles. That night, Eagles QB Michael Vick threw four touchdown passes and rushed for two more in a 59-28 win.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 11, but I get it: McNabb averaged 7.2 yards per attempt, which was better than Brunell (6.3) and Smith (6.5) in Washington.\n5. Jason Campbell (2005-09)\nGames: 52 | Record: 20-32 | TDs: 55 | INTs: 38 | Pass yards: 10,860\nHe was drafted No. 25 in 2005, one pick after Aaron Rodgers, to throw deep balls on play-action passes under Gibbs. They liked Campbell more than Rodgers, but a year later Gibbs hired Saunders, who did not run the same system. In Washington, Campbell played for two head coaches and three offensive coordinators after having four offensive coordinators at Auburn.\nKeim's take: Too high; he's more in the No. 8-9 range. Others were more effective -- namely Brunell and Smith -- but few were hurt more than Campbell by the constant changing of coaches and coordinators.\nKiper's take on Campbell (2005 first-round draft pick, No. 25 overall): I had Campbell with the same grade as my [players ranked from No. 42 to No. 52]. Having Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown [at running back] aided his cause [at Auburn]. He [was] big, athletic. But my concern was he put it all together for just one season, with the vital improvement being seen in his touchdown-to-interception ratio (20 TDs, 7 INTs in his final college season). That's why to me he was viewed as a borderline first- to third-round choice. That's why my thing was, go up and get Rodgers. He was my seventh-best player. [But] Rodgers in Washington might have been a bust. He sat three full years behind Brett Favre [in Green Bay], and they reconstructed his delivery.\n4. Gus Frerotte (1994-98)\nGames: 52 | Record: 19-26-1 | TDs: 48 | INTs: 44 | Pass yards: 9,769\nWashington had a middle-rounds grade on Frerotte, so it gladly drafted him in the seventh round in 1994 -- after taking Shuler in the first. Frerotte made the Pro Bowl in 1996, albeit with 12 TD passes and 11 interceptions, and played 15 NFL seasons. He's best remembered for head-butting the wall at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium after scoring in a 1997 game against the Giants that finished 7-7.\n\"I never get upset about it. Obviously if I could redo it I would, but I did it,\" Frerotte said of the head-butt. \"Like I tell my kids, I'll be on ESPN forever.\"\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him seventh, but spots No. 4 to No. 7 were difficult to rank because each offered something of value. Others on the list had more impact on winning games.\n3. Robert Griffin III (2012-15)*\nGames: 38 | Record: 14-22 | TDs: 40 | INTs: 23 | Pass yards: 8,097\nThe rookie season for the No. 2 pick in 2012 was magical: 20 touchdown passes, 3,200 passing yards, 815 rushing yards and only five interceptions. With Griffin, the zone-read became a popular play. He said he was happy to run the ball and dismissed the idea that he wanted to be only a drop-back passer after injuring his knee late in his rookie season, but Mike Shanahan says now, \"If Robert would have embraced the type of quarterback he was, I thought he could do so many things other quarterbacks couldn't do.\"\nSaid Griffin: \"Some defensive coordinators said that college stuff won't work, but we made it work -- and not just a little bit; we made it a staple of what we did. That showed coaches around the league you can do this with athletic quarterbacks.\"\nKeim's take: It is hard to top the impact of his rookie season, which is why I would have slotted him in this same spot. Based on his next three years, he would be far lower on the list.\nKiper's take on Griffin (2012 first-round draft pick, No. 2 overall): Some people liked RG III better than [No. 1 overall pick in 2012] Andrew Luck. [Longtime NFL coach] Tony Dungy went on record as liking RG III better. I gave Luck a 9.8 grade; I gave RG III a 9.4 grade. Nobody could argue with [Washington] taking RG III in that draft. Early on, he looked like he was going to be phenomenal. ... That injury was a big thing. As a rookie he looked like he was going to be better than Luck.\n2. Brad Johnson (1999-2000)*\nGames: 30 | Record: 18-11 | TDs: 35 | INTs: 28 | Pass yards: 6,510\nAfter Washington couldn't re-sign Green, it traded for Johnson, who threw for 4,005 yards and 24 touchdowns and was the NFL's fifth-ranked passer on the NFL's second-ranked offense in 1999. Washington won the NFC East, but Snyder signed George in the offseason.\nThat was the beginning of the end for Johnson, who knew, after multiple meetings with Snyder, that his days were numbered. Schottenheimer asked him to stay because Johnson was a good fit, but the damage was done. Johnson went to the Buccaneers, leading them to victory in Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.\n\"[Washington] was one place I would have wanted to stay,\" said Johnson, who played for four teams, including two stints with the Minnesota Vikings. \"I always told my wife and my close friends that I wish it would have worked out in Washington.\"\nSaid Mitchell: \"I would say Dan [Snyder] regrets that move, letting Brad leave, more than anything in the world. Brad was a real quarterback. He wasn't sexy, but he was intellectual.\"\nKeim's take: He would be tops on my list. The biggest issue was that he played only two years and was hurt for one of them.\n1. Kirk Cousins (2012-17)*\nGames: 64 | Record: 26-31-1 | TDs: 99 | INTs: 55 | Pass yards: 16,206\nCoaches always liked Cousins' ability and knowledge, and in 2015 it became obvious he should start. That season he threw for 4,166 yards, 29 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.\n\"[Before] if something bad happened he'd hang his head, but once he started having confidence, that's when he flourished,\" Gruden said.\nBut to keep Cousins, Washington needed to use the franchise tag in consecutive years. Once the team applied the first one, Cousins' side knew he would never sign a long-term deal because his price would be too high. The sides never came close to a deal.\nKeim's take: I understand why the analytics put him this high, but I would rank him second. If you had to win one game and were choosing between Cousins and Brad Johnson, I would take the latter."

HL Mando and HL\u00a0Klemove\u00a0will each showcase futuristic products at the flexible move zone and the clever move zone, respectively. Their joint event will also combine forces with mobility companies Argus and\u00a0Sonatus, the company says.\nDuring CES, technology development and values will be expressed in dynamic forms, such as the flexible move, clever move, multi move, and easy move through dynamic K-Dance moves, which include locking, voguing, and waacking, HL Group says. HL Mando and HL\u00a0Klemove\u00a0technology trends will be expressed through street dances that have no boundaries. The new technologies, along with the future vision of both companies, will be separately released in the exhibition display zone.\nHL Mando says its e-corner module is the culmination of the electrification system, combining brakes, steering, suspension parts, and the vehicle drive motor. HL Mando created the e-corner module thanks to its experience of developing the \u201cX-by-Wire (*SbW, *BbW).\u201d Its application is extensive, ranging from the small-, middle-, and large-size vehicles to small and large delivery robots to eco-friendly multi-purpose mobilities (*PBV), the company says. The e-corner module\u2019s advantage is its 4-wheel independent steering method, enabling once impossible concepts, such as parallel (perpendicular) parking and\u00a0u-turn\u00a0in place. In the e-corner module, *EMB and\u00a0SbW\u00a0systems will be on display. Attendees will be able to experience other electrified products, including the e-cargo (last mile mobility), patrol robots, and parking robots, through various videos.\nThe phrase \u2018Clever Move Zone\u2019 was derived from the company\u2019s name, \u201cHL\u00a0Klemove.\u201d The word \u201cKlemove\u201d is a combination of the words \u201cClever\u201d and \u201cMove.\u201d With the goal of delivering a \u201cclever mobility system,\u201d HL Mando says it will also showcase a diverse lineup of solutions, ranging from autonomous driving Level 2+ to Level 4 products.
