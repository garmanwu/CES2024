        "raw_content": "Lockly Unveils CES 2024 Showstopper: The Visage Smart Lock with Facial Recognition\nLockly, a leading smart lock company, is stealing the spotlight at CES 2024 with its revolutionary product, the Lockly Visage smart lock. Priced at $349, this high-tech marvel is set to redefine home security with its cutting-edge facial recognition technology.\nSay goodbye to traditional deadbolts as the Lockly Visage transforms your doorway into a futuristic haven. Channeling Tom Cruise vibes, unlocking your front door is as easy as approaching it. The Visage not only boasts facial recognition but also seamlessly integrates with Apple\u2019s Home Key and features a fingerprint reader for additional high-tech entry options.\nWhile facial recognition is not new to video doorbells, Lockly\u2019s Visage marks the first time this technology has been incorporated into a consumer smart lock. Unlike fingerprint unlocking, which is already popular on smart locks, facial recognition takes the process to a hands-free level. Philips has also entered the scene with its Wi-Fi Palm Recognition Smart Deadbolt, but Lockly\u2019s Visage stands out with its sleek Minority Report-inspired design.\nThe Visage utilizes binocular facial recognition through two 2MP-resolution IR sensors, capable of storing up to 100 face profiles. Unlocking occurs within 2.6 feet and takes less than 1.5 seconds. For those who prefer traditional access methods, the lock provides a digital keypad, RFID key cards, fobs, and a regular key.\nManaging the Visage is a breeze with the Lockly smartphone app, offering remote control and access management. The lock supports a range of access options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and RFID. Scheduled for release this summer, the Visage will seamlessly integrate with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant, in addition to supporting the new Matter smart home standard.\nIn a commitment to innovation, Lockly also announced the Matter Link Hub, priced at $79.99, set to launch later this year. This plug-in device will bring existing Lockly products, such as the Flex Touch Fingerprint Deadbolt, Access Touch, and Secure Plus, into the Matter ecosystem. Moreover, it will introduce Apple Home support to these locks, eliminating the need for multiple hubs.\nAs a bonus, Lockly has unveiled the first Z-Wave-certified fingerprint lock in collaboration with Alarm.com. The Lockly Guard Deadbolt Z-Wave, available directly to pro installers, can seamlessly integrate with any Alarm.com-powered home security system, offering a comprehensive solution to modern home security needs.\nBy Impact Lab\nPost navigation\nCopyright 2020 Impact Lab LLC | Impact Lab is owned and operated by Impact Lab LLC.\nBy delving into the futuring techniques of Futurist Thomas Frey,\u00a0you\u2019ll embark on an enlightening journey.\nLearn More about this exciting program."

The device has two 2MP infrared sensors that can detect a face within 2.6 feet of the door. Unlocking takes less than 1.5 seconds and can work for up to 100 faces stored in the Visage.\nLike the Lockly Vision Elite ($499.99 on Amazon), the Visage has a fingerprint scanner and a digital keypad as well as regular physical keys as alternative unlocking options. In addition the Visage allows RFID cards to grant access.\nLockly says its smart lock is compatible with Matter, but the official certification is still pending. However the Visage is expected to ship this summer with full support for Apple HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Alexa.\nLockly is also looking to bring its existing products into the smart home of the future with its Matter Link Hub.

        "raw_content": "Lockly is bringing Matter and facial recognition to your front door in 2024\nLockly makes some of the most intriguing smart locks on the market \u2014 including the premium Vision Elite and minimalist Flex Touch Pro \u2014 and now the company is gearing up to bring Matter and facial recognition to its lineup. Several new devices were revealed at CES 2024, including a Matter hub that\u2019s backward compatible with most existing Lockly products.\nThe Matter Link Hub is Lockly\u2019s first attempt at bringing the interoperability standard to its roster. By syncing your smart lock to the hub, you\u2019ll be able to integrate it with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and (for the first time) the Apple Home app. Best of all, you won\u2019t need to sacrifice any countertop space for the Matter Link Hub, as it connects directly to an electrical outlet and should take no more than a few minutes to install.\nLockly also revealed the Visage Smart Lock \u2014 a high-end smart lock equipped with facial recognition technology and support for Apple HomeKey and the Apple Home app. It\u2019s expected to work with Matter, though its certification is still pending approval. Other standout features include a fingerprint sensor, a digital keypad, the ability to issue temporary codes, and built-in Wi-Fi for remote access.\nWhile Lockly primarily focused on products designed for the average homeowner, the LocklyPro team \u2014 focused on commercial applications \u2014 debuted a new collaboration with Alarm.com. The Lockly Guard Deadbolt Z-Wave will allow users to control its performance remotely through the Alarm.com app. It will be available in two formats, allowing users to choose one either with or without a fingerprint scanner.\nThe Matter Link will be available sometime this year for $80. The Visage Smart Lock will launch this summer for $349, while release and pricing details for the Lockly Guard Deadbolt Z-Wave are yet to be announced.\nKohler showed off a bevy of new products at CES 2024, including a luxurious lineup of new smart home gadgets, all of which are designed to transform your bathroom into a \"personal sanctuary.\" Along with updates to the Numi 2.0 smart toilet and high-end Stillness Bath, Kohler showed off a new fan, sink, and bidet, as well as smart valves and more.\nThe Anthem+ Digital Control was one of the most intriguing items at the Kohler booth, as can power nearly all aspects of your bathroom from a single control panel. Via its touch display, it allows you to control water, light, sound, and steam. All told, it can connect to 12 water outlets to power a variety of sprayers, showerheads, and body sprays.\nMila -- an air purification company -- debuted two new products at CES 2024, both geared towards enhancing your indoor environment and improving the air you breathe. Products on display included the Mila Air 3 and Mila Halo, though the team also offered a look at Mila Insights, a new set of reports that give you an in-depth look at your air quality and how it can be improved.\nThe Mila Halo is the more intriguing of the two, as it's both a humidifier and air purifier packed into a single unit. Along with outer panels that are fully customizable (allowing you to find a color or pattern that fits your home d\u00e9cor), it can detect when your room is unoccupied to turn off its water tank. Not only will that prevent over-humidification, but it should allow each tank to last longer before needing a refill.\nSegway -- the company responsible for Paul Blart's preferred mode of transportation -- already has a surprisingly robust smart home lineup. The company expanded its catalog at CES 2024, revealing a new series of robot lawn mowers (Navimow i Series) and a new portable power station (Segway Cube Series).\nThe upcoming Navimow i Series makes a few big improvements over Segway's existing H Series. Along with the ability to work without wires (which are typically used to set boundaries for the robot), the i Series employs a technology known as the Exact Fusion Locating System (EFLS). Segway says this will let the robot lawn mower better track its location and ensure it's cutting your lawn as close to specifications as possible.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus.\nShare this story\nCES is where we get to see all those cool tech gadgets you see in movies become a reality, and with Lockly\u2019s latest smart lock, facial recognition is finally coming to our front doors. Yes, now you can unlock your front door like Tom Cruise.\nThe smart lock company is showing off its newest product at CES 2024 this week. The $349 Lockly Visage smart lock with facial recognition can replace your standard deadbolt and turn your doorway into a high-tech haven. Just approach, and the door will unlock. The smart lock also works with Apple\u2019s Home Key and a fingerprint reader for other high-tech home entry options.\nFacial recognition is already a thing in video doorbells \u2014 Apple Home and Google Home both support it for telling you who is at your front door \u2014 but this is the first time it\u2019s been incorporated into a consumer smart lock. While fingerprint unlocking is already a popular option on smart locks (and, in my opinion, the easiest, fastest way to unlock a door), facial recognition will make the whole process totally hands-free. Philips has also come out with a new biometric lock that it\u2019s launching at CES this year: the $359.99 Wi-Fi Palm Recognition Smart Deadbolt uses a built-in palm scanner to unlock your door.\nRelated\nHowever, the Visage has real Minority Report vibes design-wise, and if you don\u2019t like a high-tech look, this probably isn\u2019t for you. According to Lockly, the face unlock uses binocular facial recognition through two 2MP-resolution IR sensors to unlock your door as you approach. It can store up to 100 face profiles, so you can have friends and family enter hands-free, too. The company says it will unlock when you are within 2.6 feet and should do it in under 1.5 seconds.\nThe lock has a digital keypad and RFID key cards and fobs as other access options beyond scanning your face. Plus, you can use a regular old key. The Visage works with the Lockly smartphone app for remote control of the lock and sharing and managing access. It\u2019s also packed with radios to enable all of the above, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and RFID.\nFor smart home and voice assistant integration, the lock will work with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant when it arrives this summer. The company says the Visage is compatible with the new Matter smart home standard, although it\u2019s still waiting on official certification.\nSpeaking of Matter, Lockly is making good on a promise it made at CES last year that it would add Matter support to its existing locks. The company is launching a $79.99 Matter Link Hub later this year. This is a plug-in device that Lockly says can bring most existing Lockly products into Matter, including the Flex Touch Fingerprint Deadbolt, Access Touch, and Secure Plus. This will also add Apple Home support to these locks for the first time. The Matter Link Hub will replace any existing Lockly hub you use with your lock, so you won\u2019t need two.\nLockly also announced the first Z-Wave-certified fingerprint lock as a partnership with Alarm.com, meaning you can integrate it with any Alarm.com-powered home security system.

Lockly also introduced a new Wi-Fi hub that promises a quicker and more reliable connection.\nBy\nBarbara Krasnoff, a reviews editor who manages how-tos. She\u2019s worked as an editor and writer for almost 40 years. Previously, she was a senior reviews editor for Computerworld.\nShare this story\nSmart locks are a really handy addition to a home, but for those who can\u2019t switch their existing deadbolts out\u00a0\u2014 such as renters \u2014 the options have been more limited. Now, they may have an alternative: Lockly\u2019s Flex Touch Pro is a retrofit smart lock with fingerprint access built in, meaning you can keep your existing lock and key and add smart features to it.\nThe Flex Touch Pro uses Lockly\u2019s 3D biometric touch technology to enable quick access to a home; the company says that it can store up to 99 fingerprints. With the help of the associated app, you can lock, unlock, or check the door status using Google Home or Amazon Alexa; you can also control remote access and monitoring.\nThe lock comes with three frames that allow you to attach it to your existing deadbolt. On the outside of your door, the biometric fingerprint sensor fits neatly under the lock; on the inside, a rather large housing (measuring 79 x 187 mm) fits on the door, containing 4 AA batteries.\nIt comes with a redesigned Wi-Fi hub that Lockly says provides better connectivity and stability. There is no support for Apple Home or Matter, but the company says Matter is under development and could possibly be added to future products.\nRelated\nThere are relatively few good retrofit smart locks available. One of the best is the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock, which doesn\u2019t come with built-in biometric access but does work with HomeKit. The SwitchBot Door Lock is less expensive, and you can add fingerprint access via a Bluetooth keypad, but it looks like something of a kludge. Lockly\u2019s Flex Touch Pro is expected to be available for $229 sometime in the spring of 2023.\nLockly is also introducing a full-replacement smart lock at CES, the Access Touch Pro, which is an upgrade of its current Flex Touch Fingerprint Deadbolt. The Access Touch Pro completely replaces your existing deadbolt and comes with the same new Wi-Fi hub as the Flex Touch Pro.\nNew features include Air Transfer, which transfers fingerprint profiles across Lockly products, and Family Mode, which lets you unlock several of the company\u2019s locks simultaneously. According to Lockly, Access Touch Pro will be available on its website for $249.99 sometime in the first quarter of 2023.\nFord\u2019s new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car\nApple\u2019s sci-fi thriller Constellation gets haunting first trailer\niOS 17.3 is out, adding Stolen Device Protection for your iPhone\nThe Vision Pro\u2019s first killer app is the web, whether Apple likes it or not\nSamsung\u2019s smart ring might signal the start of a new wearable era\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2023: all the news from the year\u2019s biggest tech conference\nAt CES one company was showing off...an E-Ink headset?\nSix smart home finds from CES 2023 you may have missed\nThe regulatory maze behind health tech vaporware\nToday\u2019s Vergecast: the smart TVs, Matter gadgets, and concept cars from CES\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nCES 2024 Day 2: The best gear for Apple users from the show floor\nCES is still underway, and we've been to a lot of events and spent time scouring the show floor. Here's a roundup of some of our favorite gear for Apple users that we've seen in presentations and behind closed-doors.\nCES is always packed with a lot of stuff, and not all of it has appeal to Apple users. Fortunately, we go every year to tell you what we've seen, what's trending, and what we think is vapor.\nAll of today's selections are some of our top picks from the show floor \u2014\nbut like always, there's been a lot of weird stuff too. We'll be talking about those soon enough.\nAbode Edge\nSmart home security company Abode is out with its latest camera \u2014\nthe Abode Edge. This camera is the first to utilize Wi-Fi HaLow technology giving it extraordinary range.\nThe Abode Edge camera is a small fist-sized camera with a white plastic body and a large antenna protruding from the size. Thanks to Wi-Fi HaLow, it is able to connect up to a mile and a half away.\nIt's powered by AI technology as well, identifying people and animals as the come into view.\nThe Abode edge is expected to ship later in the first quarter of 2024, and should retail for $199.99. A subscription is necessary, for $3.99 per month for one camera, and as many Abode cams connected as you want for $6.99 per month.\nAqara\nAdding to its lineup, Aqara is showing off three new noteworthy devices at the annual tech show. The company is showing off the U300 lock, M3 hub, and a new Thread border router plug.\nThe U300 looks great and is an indoor/outdoor lever lock. It's great for a garage, shed, or in-home office that you may need to secure.\nThis lock has several methods of entry, including Apple Home, fingerprint, or keypad. Behind the fingerprint reader is also a physical key hole when necessary.\nAqara's new M3 smart hub can connect to many devices other than those made by Aqara itself. It has built in Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Thread. It will also be the first IR blaster supported by Apple Home.\nFinally, there is a new Thread border router hub. It will help expand your network in a similar fashion to Apple's HomePod.\nPricing and availability timelines of the Aqara gear aren't yet clear.\nEcovacs\nIn late 2023, Ecovacs released its X2 Omni robotic vacuum cleaner that assumed an unusual square shape, unique from the typical disc-shaped models.\nAt CES, they're out with a slightly modified version. The new X2 Combo includes the same X2 Omni robot, but also attached a secondary vacuum.\nTo the right of the base station you'll find a handheld vacuum that is both charged and emptied by the same docking station.\nIt includes three different attachment tools and there is an optional stick and roller attachment users can purchase.\nLastly, Ecovacs has committed to bringing Matter support to the X2 Combo, allowing it to display in the Apple Home app.\nThe Ecovacs X2 Combo will be available to purchase this spring in the US. Pricing is not yet available.\nRoborock\nLike Ecovacs, Robock has a new flagship model at the tech show that will soon support Matter. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be launching early this year.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra has a whopping 10,000Pa of suction and a new robotic arm that extends out to clean closer to the wall. A secondary small spinning mop has also been added to scrub against your walls.\nCompared to the S8 Pro, the S8 Pro MaxV Ultra has increased the clearance on the mop. It now raises 20mm when it detects carpet, up from 5mm.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra will retail for $1799.99 and the S8 Max Ultra will run $1599.99. Both should be available in April.\nLockly\nThe new Visage lock from Lockly is the first one from the company to support Apple Home natively. It also supports Apple Home Key.\nAside from Home Key, it has a rotating set of numbers for the on-screen keypad and a set of stereoscopic cameras for facial recognition. The cameras have multiple anti-spoofing measures to ensure that things like photos and masks won't work.\nIt uses Wi-Fi built in and should yield roughly a year on battery life.\nThe Lockly Matter Link hub will be priced at $79.99 when it ships later in 2024. The Lockly Visage will retail for $349.99 and ship in several finishes in the\nsummer of 2024.\nESR\nAccessory maker ESR is going all-in on Qi2 at CES 2024, showing off a whole range of chargers using the new standard.\nLaunching first will be the company's car charger that attaches to your vehicles vent and uses an adjustable stabilizing arm to prevent bouncing.\nOther devices to follow include a 3-in-1 HaloLock desk charger, a 3-in-1 HaloLock travel charger, and a single HaloLock cable.\nThe Car Charger will launch in mid-January with the other products following in later months. Shop on ESR's Amazon page to learn more.\nOWC\nThe new OWC Thunderblade X8is the brand's newest professional SSD that boasts eight NVMe 2242 modules. This builds on the previous design that had four modules on the inside.\nOther specs include dual Thunderbolt 3 ports, relocated lights that are now downward-facing, and a maximum capacity of 32TB of storage.\nThe ThunderBlade X8 may be configured as RAID 1, 4, 5, and 1+0 too which includes various degrees of data redundancy. It boasts read speeds of 2565 MB/s and write speeds of 2464 MB/s.\nThe ThunderBlade X8 is available in 8TB, 16TB, and 32TB capacities, catering to various professional needs. It's now available for pre-order starting at $1,749.99 on macsales.com.\nAppleInsider is at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show this week until January 12, with our reporters seeing the latest HomeKit devices, Apple accessories, 8K monitors, massive televisions, and more in-person throughout the event.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best smart home gadgets of CES 2024\nCustomize your home and make everyday tasks easier\nIt can be hard to keep track of the best smart home devices shown off at CES 2024. There has been no shortage of reveals from AI-powered appliances to robot assistants. Lucky for you, our team has sorted through the waves of upcoming products and concepts to pick out the gear that stands to make your life easier.\nWe've rounded up the 7 best smart home gadgets from the year's biggest tech show in the list below. These devices feature new apps and mechanical functions that will both improve your living space and make it even easier to use each day.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nBest smart home controller\nLinxura Smart Home Controller\nThis compact puck-shaped device can control up to 52 smart home devices through an iPod-like scrollwheel. It sets itself apart from other physical smart home controllers because it is compatible with a wide range of platforms like Alexa, Sonos, LIFX and Philips. Future updates will add support for Matter and Google Home.\nYou can see up to four of your devices at a time on this tiny gadget's E Ink screen. Turn the click wheel and you can see additional pages of devices along with scenes to control them. Linxura's decision to opt for E ink over an LCD display pays off as the controller can last up to three months on a single charge. When it finally runs out of juice you recharge it by plugging a USB-C charger into a port on the back.\nOne click on the wheel will turn whatever device you\u2019ve selected on while a double click will turn it off. However, you can also click and hold to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise to enable the wheel to adjust different smart home device functions like brightness, temperature, volume, etc. Linxura also sells a wall mount for the device on its website. This way, you can leave it mounted on your bed\u2019s headrest or even on the wall in the kitchen where more people will be able to access and use it.\u00a0Think of it much like a\u00a0smart light switch, but for every connected device in your home. The Linxura Smart Controller is available now for $99.\nBest smart lights\nNanoleaf Permanent Outdoor Lights\nLike the Govee Permanent Outdoor light kit we reviewed last year, Nanoleaf's smart exterior lighting system is weatherproof to be left outside all year round. These multicolor lights add extra visibility and style to your home's outdoor spaces such as your front yard or back patio.\nYou can use the Nanoleaf app to cycle through hues and animated patterns. These lights will also sync with Nanoleaf's new Orchestrator desktop app to use your computer as a direct sound source. This lets you sync your lights to move with clean audio from any music streaming platform or audio player.\nAs it stands, most smart lights use your smartphone or tablet's built-in microphones to sync smart lights to the beat. Unfortunately nearby sounds like passing cars or people talking could ruin the effect. The new lights are set to arrive in Spring 2024, with pricing to be revealed at a later date.\nBest robot vacuum\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is the company's most intelligent hybrid robot vacuum and mop. Roborock's onboard computer powers a voice assistant, robot arm, and advanced obstacle avoidance. It can even make video calls or let you drop in on a live video feed provided by its built-in camera as it cruises around your rooms. This makes it even more versatile as one of the best security cameras and robot vacuums available. Plus it supports the Matter protocol to work with any smart home ecosystem going forward.\nWhen the S8 MaxV Ultra finishes cleaning (using AI to adjust cleaning settings) each room of your home, it automatically returns to its compact docking station to empty its dirt bin, refill its mop, and charge up its battery. On top of that, the base cleans itself and washes the mop with hot water then a blow dry to ensure everything is clean to prevent odors.\u00a0This Roborock variant can even be connected directly to your home's plumbing pipes to provide the robot with clean water and drainage without you having to fill up and empty tanks. The S8 MaxV Ultra will be available from Roborock for $1,800 this April.\nBest home robot\nSamsung Ballie Robot\nAI had a major presence in Samsung's smart home lineup from appliances like its Bespoke smart fridge to its latest televisions. Samsung's Ballie AI robot has a leg up on competition from brands like LG because it can project video, control your smart home devices, and even map out your smart home using LiDAR to place connected devices on SmartThings Map View as it wanders around your home. Ballie can even answer your calls and send you a message with updates on your pets. Unfortunately, there are no details on price, launch or availability.\nBest smart lock\nLockly Visage\nThe Lockly Visage is the first home smart lock that uses facial scanning to unlock your door. It works by using two 2MP-resolution IR cameras to accurately detect your face from about three feet away. Not only does this keep your hands completely free, but it works efficiently in under two seconds.\nLockly's app lets you store up to 100 face profiles, configure motion its motion sensor, and control the smart lock over the internet thanks to its built-in Wi-Fi. We've used Lockly's Flex and Vision models before and can vouch for the responsiveness of their fingerprint reader and PIN Genie scrambling function that have been carried over to this model.\u00a0We plan to test the Visage before it releases this summer for $349.\nBest smart appliance\nLG Smart WashCombo\nLG's all-in-one washer saves you valuable room by combining a washer and dryer into a single appliance. Despite its space-saving ventless design, the WashCombo can still hold 5.0 cu Ft of large laundry piles or a king-sized comforter.\nOnce you throw your load in, the washer's onboard AI uses sensors to detect fabrics, soil level, and size. This then creates an optimized cleaning setting almost instantly and finishes a job in just two hours. Of course, this appliance ships with LG's ThinQ smart home platform lets you check on a cycle's status, control the washer, and receive notifications from anywhere over the web.\nThe SmartWash Combo WM6998HBA ($2,999, LG) is now available for purchase at\u00a0LG.com.\nBest smart security camera\nAbode Edge Wireless Security Camera\nIf you own a larger property, then Abode's new wireless Edge security camera packs a game-changing 1.5-mile Wi-Fi range. It's the first camera to use WiFi HaLow, a low-power long-range wireless data transmission signal that travels much further than your standard Wi-Fi signals. Its throughput is seriously limited between a measly 150 Kbps to 15 Mbps \u2014 however still enough for a stable video feed.\nAbode hasn't shared any specs aside from its weatherproof IP67 rating and the built-in 6,000-mAh battery capacity, which the company claims should last for up to one full year. The camera sits in a deep-sleep mode until its motion sensor detects actitvity to stretch this battery life even further.\nThe Abode Edge Camera is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2024, and will cost $199. You'll also have to own the Abode home security system to use it, which starts at $139 for its most basic setup, the\u00a0Abode Security Kit.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing.

Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support).

At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away.

The TP-Link Archer GE800 delivers maximum flexibility, maxmimum power, and maxmimum style, so you can just focus on your game.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on TP-Link for\n$TBD\nVictrola Stream Sapphire Wi-Fi Record Player\nVictrola\u2019s follow-up to its Stream Carbon turntable is a worthy premium upgrade for vinyl-lovers looking to go wireless with their audio setup. Dubbed the Stream Sapphire, it\u2019s the company\u2019s most high-end turntable to date, and has improved upon its predecesser in nearly ever way.\nFirst off, the turntable has more wireless streaming capabilities than ever, and it\u2019s compatible with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP). This means you can connect it to an AV receiver or smart TV for a wider variety in how you can play your records.\nThe Stream Sapphire also sports some spiffy audio specs, with a chic, bespoke walnut veneer plinth, an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge, and support for streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz). Although this turntable is really meant to bring out the best cadences in your vinyl, it\u2019ll also give you ability to use Apple AirPlay or Google Chromecast for Bluetooth audio streaming.\nCombining analog audio mastery with the convenience of wireless streaming makes the Stream Sapphire sound as good as it looks.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Victrola for\n$1,499\nWeber Summit FS38X Smart Gas Grill\nGrill titan Weber brought the heat this year at CES in 2024 with their new flagship Summit FS38X Smart Grill, which has a never-before-seen grill feature you might just fall in love with.\nThis new grill comes decked out with everything from a touchscreen that displays real-time data on whatever you\u2019re grilling, to internal sensors you can use to track the temperature of the food you\u2019re cooking so you can make adjustments on the fly. But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance here is the addition of an infrared broiler.\nThe ultimate key to creating the perfect crust on any grilled meats, the Summit FS38X Smart Grill\u2019s broiler can be raised and lowered to achieve a quick, mouth-wateringly good crust to steak, pork chops, fish, and more.\u00a0The Summit even gives suggestions on the optimal method for whatever you\u2019re cooking and hwre you should place it on the grates to get the best results.\nFor amaeuter cooks to potential grillmasters alike, Weber\u2019s Summit FS38X Smart Grill takes most of the guesswork and uncertainty out of the grilling process.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Weber for\n$3,800\nWithings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor\nNo, it\u2019s not quite the medical tricorder from\u00a0Star Trek, but the Withings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor might just be a step in the right direction. Liked a supped-up thermameter, this handheld device is capable of measuring everything from body temperature to blood oxygen saturation, and that\u2019s not even the half of it.\nThe BeamO serves as a kind of\u00a0digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions, and according the company it can detect early signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more. Users can then share those results with a doctor via smartphone, and even \u201clivestream\u201d their stethoscope audio over telehealth appointments.\nWithings are currently waiting for FDA approval, but we\u2019re excited about BeamO\u2019s prospects, putting the power of an EmergiMed in the palm of your hands.\u00a0Releases: Summer 2024.\nBuy on Withings for\n$250\nXGIMI Horizon Max Projector\nThe future is bright for XGIMI\u2019s Horizon Max Projector, one of the most impressive projectors we\u2019ve ever seen. It delivers IMAX-level picture quality with time-saving setup features to make it the ultimate home cinema package.\nThe first long-throw projector to feature the IMAX Enhanced certification, the Horizon Max is their brightest model to date thanks to the use of triple MCL lasers typically found in commercial theater projectors. This means it can project a 180-inch screen with a whopping 3,100 ISO lumens of brightness, all in a super-portable package.\nBut you won\u2019t just be blinded by the light \u2014 you\u2019ll be impressed by how intelligent the Horizon Max can be too with \u201cIntelligent Screen Adaptation\u201d technology. The projector sends signals to the wall and measures the angle and the distance, accurately auto-correcting and auto-focusing within seconds. No more wasting time focus-correcting, since your picture will be sharp and bright no matter where you aim it.\nBy boosting the brightness and picture quality and eliminating unecessary setup fuss, XGIMI\u2019s small yet mighty Horizon Max is the new golden standard for \u201cpoint and play\u201d projectors.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy Horizon Max Projector $TBD\nMore News\nThese Small Space Heaters Help Warm Up Your Home, Office or Studio\nHow to Watch the Complete 'Sex and the City' Series Online Free\n25 Valentine's Day Gift Ideas for the Jewelry Lover in Your Life\n'60 Minutes': Everything You Need to Know About How to Stream the Acclaimed News Series Online\nLuxurious Murder: How to Watch 'Death and Other Details' Online\nThe Latest\nNorah Jones Returns With New Album 'Visions,' First Single 'Running'\nPost Malone, Reba McEntire, Andra Day Lead 2024 Super Bowl Pre-Game\nTrump Demands Total Presidential Immunity \u2014 Even for Acts That 'Cross the Line'\nRichard Simmons Disavows Pauly Shore-Starring Biopic in Rare Statement\nThe digital daily newsletter\nMost Popular\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Leads Critics Choice Awards With 8 Wins, \u2018Barbie\u2019 Scores 6 \u2014 Full Winners List\nEmmy Awards: Winners List\nNew Photos Prove Patrick & Brittany Mahomes\u2019 Children Have the Same, Grumpy Facial Expression\nUnsealed Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0Documents Spark New Allegations against Collector Leslie Wexner\nYou might also like\nDana Carvey Returns to Work After Son\u2019s Death and Calls \u2018Riffing\u2019 With David Spade on Their Podcast \u2018Very Healthy\u2019; Chris Farley\u2019s Mom Wrote Him a Letter of Support\nMaison & Objet, Olympic Torch Designer Turns Focus to Pioneering\u00a0Solutions\nThe Best Treadmills Under $500, According to Personal Trainers\n2024 BAFTA Nominations: \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Dominates, See Full List\nFresno State Title IX Lacrosse Suit Revives Class Push on\u00a0Appeal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Signup\nGot a Hot News Tip?\nWe want to hear it.

        "raw_content": "Tech trends at CES 2024 point to transformational change\nCanva\nSmart home expert Brandon Doyle checked out this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show, highlighting tech elements today\u2019s homebuyers and homeowners want to know more about.\nInman Connect\nThis January marks Inman\u2019s fifth annual Agent Appreciation Month, which culminates at Inman Connect New York in a celebration of agents at the end of January. Plus, we\u2019re rolling out the coveted Inman Power Player Awards, as well as the New York Power Brokers and MLS Innovators awards.\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, otherwise known as CES 2024, is the premier global event showcasing the latest technological innovations. It has been a spectacle of advancements, particularly in the realm of smart home technology.\nAs real estate professionals, understanding these developments is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of homebuyer preferences and market trends. Here are some of this year\u2019s most significant tech trends from CES 2024 and their potential impact on the real estate industry.\nAI: The buzzword of the year\nArtificial intelligence (AI) was a pervasive theme at CES 2024, featured in almost every product category. From smart appliances to home security, AI\u2019s integration promises enhanced efficiency, personalization and user experience.\nFor instance, Govee\u2019s AI-powered lighting solutions create dynamic scenes for various home settings, suggesting a future where home environments adapt intelligently to occupants\u2019 needs.\nRevolutionary home appliances\nLG\u2019s showcase included a transparent screen and an energy-efficient washer/dryer combo, emphasizing space-saving and energy conservation \u2014 two key considerations for modern homeowners.\nWhirlpool introduced SlimTech Insulation in refrigerators, 66 percent thinner yet offering 25 percent more capacity, which signifies a leap in appliance efficiency and design.\nElectric vehicles (EVs) and home integration\nDuring Sony\u2019s press conference, the Afeela was driven on stage with a PlayStation controller and remote technology. Not to be outdone, BMW had a demonstration where they were driving a car completely remotely from a location offsite with a traditional steering wheel, peddles and screens which imitated the actual car.\nMeanwhile, Honda showcased concept cars, hinting at the future of EV design and its influence on residential EV charging solutions. While these concepts may not come to market anytime soon, they illustrate the growing synergy between home technology and automotive advancements.\nLighting and power management innovations\nGE Lighting, a Savant company, has expanded its product lines with dynamic lighting effects and integrated power management systems. The ability to manage energy consumption and backup power solutions like the ones offered by Savant, EcoFlow, Emporia and others will become more commonplace in years to come.\nSmart locks and home security\nAdvances in smart locks, such as U-tec\u2019s compatibility with Apple Key and Lockly\u2019s Visage with facial recognition, offer enhanced security features, a key selling point in the modern home security market.\nSecuram, U-Tec and Aqara are all expanding into other smart home categories, which reflects the growing demand for integrated, comprehensive home automation systems. Now, when you unlock your front door, it could turn on a light or disarm your security system.\nCleaning and maintenance: Robot vacuums and lawnmowers\nRoborock introduced advanced robot vacuums with AI detection, voice control and multi-function capabilities, indicating a shift towards more autonomous home maintenance. Narwal demonstrated innovative designs like anti-tangle brushes and dirty water detection, highlighting convenience and efficiency. Dreame added a TriCut brush to its flagship robot vacuum, which eliminates tangles from hair.\nBoth Ecovacs and Dreame announced robot lawnmowers, and Yarbo demonstrated its modular lawnmower/snowblower. These systems all use advanced GPS and other sensors to operate autonomously within a defined area without installing a guide wire.\nCameras and surveillance\nReolink has a new line of point-of-entry, dual-lens cameras along with enhanced Wi-Fi cameras with AI recognition, tracking, and a new base station to record footage locally. Abode announced the world\u2019s first Wi-Fi HaLow, Ultra Long Range, battery-powered, AI-enabled smart home security camera with a range of over one mile.\nFor real estate professionals, these technological advancements offer a new dimension for property listings and marketing. Highlighting features like energy-efficient appliances, integrated EV charging solutions, advanced home security systems and AI-powered maintenance tools can significantly enhance a property\u2019s appeal to tech-savvy buyers.\nMoreover, understanding these trends enables Realtors to advise clients on potential upgrades that can increase a property\u2019s value and appeal in a competitive market. As smart home technology becomes a standard expectation rather than a luxury, Realtors who are knowledgeable about these innovations will be better equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving real estate landscape.\nCES 2024 has not only unveiled cutting-edge technology but has also set the tone for future home design and functionality. For the real estate industry, these advancements are not just gadgets and gizmos but essential components of the modern, connected home that appeals to a new generation of homebuyers.\nBrandon Doyle is a Realtor at\u00a0Doyle Real Estate Team \u2014 RE/MAX Results\u00a0in Minneapolis and co-author of\u00a0Mindset, Methods & Metrics \u2013 Winning as a Modern Real Estate Agent.\u00a0You can follow him on\u00a0Twitter.\nRead next\nRead Next\nSimply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nBut though these futuristic flying cars and talking robots are intriguing, most smart home users' needs are much simpler: smart home sensors that work reliably, interoperability improvements, and even a robot vacuum that doesn't get hair tangles.\nCutting through all the CES noise isn't easy, but that's what ZDNET is here for.\nCync by GE Lighting Undercabinet lighting\nBest in smart lighting\nGE Lighting, a Savant company, launched new Cync Undercabinet smart light fixtures at CES 2024 that are available as puck and bar fixtures to suit your space's needs. Cync gives customers the choice of hard-wiring, plug-in, or battery installation, and the ability to connect up to ten of these Matter smart lights together. They'll be available later in 2024.\nHonorable mentions\nOut of the many other smart lights showcased at CES 2024, an honorable mention goes to\u00a0Nanoleaf's new Smart Outdoor String Lights, which look like beautiful string lights you'd see on a patio but pack the company's smarts inside, complete with Matter support.\nDreame X30 Ultra robot vacuum and mop\nBest robot vacuum\nCES always delivers fantastic achievements in robotics, including robot vacuums and mops. One that caught ZDNET's resident robot vacuum expert's eye is the Dreame X30 robot vacuum and mop. This robot vacuum features an anti-tangle feature that cuts any hair that may be tangled in the brush rollers.\n\"The cutting heads are carefully positioned to do this, carefully tucking away the heads to ensure that your floors and carpets aren't scratched as the robot moves along,\" according to ZDNET's Beth Mauder.\nAside from this feature, the Dreame X30 features 8000Pa of suction power, dual oscillating mop heads, and automatic carpet detection to lift its mop pads up to 10.5mm. It's available for preorder at the early bird special of $1,240, down from its $1,700 retail price.\nHonorable mentions\nOther brands like Roborock and Ecovacs also launched new products at CES 2024. Roborock launched a new S8 Max series of robot vacuums and mops available in April 2024, including S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra, both of which will feature an alternative refill and drainage system that connects to a home's water supply.\nEcovacs also announced a new variant of the Deebot X2 Omni, the Deebot X2 Combo, available at the end of March for $1,599. This variant makes the Omni station, where the robot vacuum docks to empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, also function as a charging dock for a new Ecovacs handheld stick vacuum.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\nBest energy management solutions\nEcoFlow stole the home energy spotlight at CES 2024 with the launch of its largest portable battery to date, the Delta Pro Ultra. Combined with an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2, the DPU inverter and battery combination can also serve as a home backup system that can be charged with AC, solar, or gas generators.\nThe introductory price of $4,999 buys the Delta Pro Ultra with 6kWh capacity, and users can stack up to five batteries under each inverter, combining up to three inverters with one Smart Home Panel for a total of 90kWh.\nHonorable mentions\nImpressive features aside, EcoFlow isn't the only company showcasing energy solutions at CES. Savant demoed a new Power Storage System, a smart panel and backup solution that works with the Savant professional app to help users save money on energy costs by switching from grid to backup easily.\nAnker also officially launched the Solix F3800 for sale after a successful Kickstarter campaign, as well as a smaller portable battery, the Anker Solix C800 Plus.\nLockly Visage Facial Recognition Smart Lock\nBest for home security\nImagine coming home with arms full of grocery bags and being able to unlock your door by simply facing it, as if it knows exactly who you are, because it does. Lockly launched a new residential smart lock that supports facial recognition technology, the Lockly Visage.\nThis is even more convenient than using a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key to unlock your door -- \u00a0but don't worry, the Lockly Visage also supports both of those options for unlocking. And if you're still feeling old school, you can also unlock it with a keypad or physical key.\nThis Matter-enabled smart lock will be available this summer for $349.\nHonorable mentions\nSmart home brand Abode also launched a new Wi-Fi HaLow camera with an ultra-long transmission range of over 1.5 miles. The battery-powered Abode Edge Camera could be placed anywhere on your property and never lose internet connection, as long as it's within 1.5 miles of your router. The Abode Edge Camera will launch later in Q1 for $200.\nPhilips also launched a new 5000 Series smart lock with palm recognition technology that lets users unlock their doors without touching them. This lock also has a doorbell button on the front and comes with a chime in the box that remains plugged in inside the home.\nPanasonic delivers AI assistance\nBest in smart appliances\nCES 2024's AI theme collided with the smart home, as Panasonic announced a new collaboration with Fresco, a smart kitchen platform leader, to introduce an advanced cooking AI assistant for Panasonic kitchen appliances. This will begin with the new Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 multi-oven.\nThe AI assistant will be able to customize recipes based on dietary preferences and restrictions, ingredient substitutions based on what's available in your pantry, and adjustments of serving sizes and cooking settings.\nHonorable mentions\nRevolution Cooking's new Macrowave Oven is the perfect replacement for a microwave, air fryer, countertop oven, and broiler in one. This device is smart enough to do it all: it seamlessly switches between microwaving leftovers and air-frying wings with the touch of an LCD screen. It comes with a sturdy price tag of $1,800 however.\nBoth Samsung and LG took to CES to showcase their new all-in-one washer and dryer combos, complete with AI integrations to optimize laundry cycles and reduce energy use.\nSeveral companies also showcased new tech for the furriest family members at home, including the Sevvy Smart cooker, Hisense Smart Built-in Dishwasher with Autodose and AutoDry, an RCA automatic pet feeder and a Smart Bird Feeder, Tineco Floor ONE S7 combo floor cleaner, among many others.\nThe best smart home robots\nSamsung revamped Ballie, its home robot companion, which failed to take off after being showcased at CES 2020. Ballie is a round smart home hub that can patrol your home using its built-in camera, and its built-in projector can project images on walls, floors, and ceilings.\nAlso: Samsung adds new SmartThings features, including Map View\nEcovacs launched a new model of its window cleaning model that can reach new places. The Winbot W2 Omni comes with a portable station that carries a battery so you can use it to clean windows inside and out.\nBeabot is launching a new AquaSense Pro robot pool cleaner that can clean not only floors and walls but also the water surface and clarify water. It's available for pre-order at $1,699.\nRobot lawnmowers:\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe best headphones of CES 2024 so far\nFrom indoor solar to light-based internet, photonics offers a brighter future"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 day 4 \u2014 here's 7 amazing gadgets you need to see\nCES 2024 isn't winding down just yet, and there are still more gadgets to enjoy\nIf you thought all the best announcements at CES 2024 would happen on the first couple of days, you were mistaken. Day 4 of the show is now here, and the end of the show is drawing ever nearer, but there\u2019s no shortage of cool gadgets and products out on the show floor.\nSome of those gizmos are a little bizarre, like brain-reading headphones, while others could prove to make a real difference in your day to day lives. Alexa getting generative AI capabilities is one notable example, even if you think AI is just a gimmick.\nHere are 7 new products you should know about heading into CES 2024 day 4...\nGenerative AI comes to Alexa\nOne of countless numbers of AI announcements at CES 2024 is that generative AI is coming to the Alexa virtual assistant. Large language model capabilities were made available to Alexa skill developers last year, and the first ones are now here.\nThree new skills are coming, including an updated version of the game 20 questions \u2014 uses AI to enhance user interactivity. There\u2019s also a character creation tool, which lets you interact with fictional characters in real time. They can be totally original or based on people who do or have existed. Then there\u2019s a music creation tool that will generate new tracks based on your own prompts, with the added ability to customize it after the fact. Once done, that'll be sent to your phone to download.\nThose skills are available now, and you simply need to ask Alexa to \u201copen Volley Games\u201d, \u201copen Character.AI\u201d or \u201copen Slash Music\u201d.\nHiSense UX Mini-LED TV\nThere\u2019s no shortage of extreme TVs at any tech show, but the new HiSense UX Mini-LED TV looks like the best of the lot. In fact, if the specs touted by HiSense are accurate it could be a record breaker in itself \u2014 all thanks to a 110-inch screen with 10,000 nit brightness and 40,000 local dimming zones.\nEssentially that means it\u2019s one of the brightest TVs ever made, and in a larger form factor. On top of this you also have 4.2.2 channel Dolby Atmos speakers, 4K resolution, covers 100% DCI-P3 color space and the Hi-View Engine X \u2014 which utilizes a 16-bit AI neural chip to offer object-based upscaling. 4 HDMI ports are included too, though only 2 of them are full speed HDMI 2.1.\nThere\u2019s no word on pricing or availability just yet, but we expect the HiSense UX Mini-LED TV will launch sometime later this year.\nLockly Zeno Series Visage smart lock\nWe\u2019ve already seen plenty of smart locks with biometric security, but that usually involves fingerprint scanners. What if your lock could scan your face and have your door ready to open when you reach it? The Lockly Zeno Series Versage smart lock can do just that.\nAided by built-in Wi-Fi and a pair of 2MP IR face-scanning cameras, this lock is capable of recognising up to 100 face profiles and have your door ready to unlock in less than 2 seconds. Of course it still has a fingerprint reader, an auto-scrambling PIN pad and the option to unlock via iPhone or Apple Watch via HomeKit. But they\u2019re not quite as impressive, or convenient.\nThe LocklyZeno Series Visage smart lock goes on sale this summer, for $349.\nMW75-Neuro brain-scanning headphones\nYes there really are headphones that can scan your brain activity at CES 2024, made thanks to a partnership between Neurable and audiophile brand Master & Dynamics. Using this brainwave-scanning feature, and paired with a companion app, the MW75-Neuro can apparently measure how focussed you are.\nThey\u2019re also capable of detecting signs of stress, at which point the headphones prompt you to take a break. The feature has more of a practical use too, with testing showing how a user could simply mouth commands like \u201cskip track\u201d and have it be picked up by the headphones. Plus compared to more scientific brain-scanning tech, a simple pair of cans looks a lot less threatening.\nIf these sound interesting, they\u2019ll be available to buy before the end of March for the princely sum of $649.\nSegway E2 Pro\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new electric scooter to aid your commute, Segway\u2019s $499 E2 Pro might be the CES reveal to keep an eye on \u2014 especially since it has safety features you won\u2019t find on other similarly priced scooters.\nThis scooter offers a 16.8-mile range, a top speed of 15.5 miles per hour and a 750W motor for hill gradients up to 18%. Plus handlebar turn signals, ambient lights, traction control (with 10-inch tires) and support for Apple Find My. The cheaper Segway E2 and E2 Plus will also be available for lower price tags, but with slightly less powerful hardware. Be sure to check out our overview of Segway\u2019s CES 2024 announcements for more details.\nMinitailz AI smart collar\nThat\u2019s right AI for your pets, in the form of a smart collar for cats and dogs. Priced at $99, the Mintailz AI smart collar is able to track usual things like location, heart rate and activity, while also monitoring heart health and appetite. The AI is involved to help analyze that information and ensure you\u2019re up to date on any potential health problems.\nBattery life is rated for 10-14 days per charge, while IP67 water and dust resistance and real time location tracking using a combination of GPS, LTE and Wi-Fi, Though this will require a SIM Card and an $8.30-per-month subscription. Which is a small price to pay if you have a dog that likes to slip off for a solo adventure when you\u2019re not looking.\nLinxura Smart Controller\nThere are loads of ways to control your smart home, but if you\u2019re not a fan of using voice controls or having to meddle with apps, then CES 2024 could have the perfect smart home controller for you. And the Linxura Smart Controller has an iPod-style scrollwheel that\u2019s oh-so satisfying to use.\nThe best part is that this physical controller works for products from multiple manufacturers, including those compatible with Alexa, Sonos, LIFX and Phillips \u2014 plus upcoming support for Matter and Google Home. The controller can store up to 52 devices, and you use the scroll wheel to move between them and control things like brightness or temperature. The e-ink display also means you can get up to 3 months on a single charge.\nThe Linxura Smart Controller is available now for $99.\nHonorable mentions\nAs ever there are plenty of impressive products on the CES show floor that deserve an honorable mention. Either for being impressive, albeit not that exciting, or just plain bonkers. Like Sony\u2019s new spatial computing headset, complete with dual 1.3\u201d 4K OLED microdisplays, a Qualcomm XR2+ Gen 2 chipset and a pair of bespoke controllers. Sadly this isn\u2019t a PSVR 2 successor, because it\u2019s built for making games rather than playing them.\nKlipsch and Onkyo have also joined forces for a new soundbar that\u2019ll have audiophiles excited, due out in April later this year. If you want something truly bonkers, then there\u2019s always the eVTOL Flying Car, an actual car that features fold-out propellers that supposedly allow the car to take off and fly over upcoming traffic jams. We\u2019ll believe it when we can actually buy one, though.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Day 2: Transparent TVs From LG, OtterBox's Cactus Leather, Lockly Smart Locks and More\nCES is underway in Las Vegas, and while it's been overshadowed by Apple's Vision Pro launch date announcement, there are still plenty of interesting new products to look at. MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera is at CES to bring us an overview of what's worth checking out.\nLike Samsung, LG was showing off transparent display technology with the LG Signature OLED T (T for transparent). LG's OLED TV is coming out later this year, and it can transition between transparency and an opaque background for television watching. LG has designed content specifically for the see-through background, and some of it has an almost hologram-like look.\nLockly was showing off a HomeKit-compatible smart lock that uses facial recognition to open the door, while Ember brought its cup warming technology to baby bottles. Aqara showed off an indoor lock with fingerprint detection, and Scosche was on hand to demo the BaseLynx 2.0, its modular charging system for Apple devices.\nOtterBox has a new environmentally friendly iPhone case made of cactus leather, Orbi showed off a new Wi-Fi 7 mesh router setup, and GE had an indoor smokeless smoker that uses pellets.\nDan will be wandering the show floor on Tuesday, so make sure to stay tuned to see tomorrow's CES roundup video.
