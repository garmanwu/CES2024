Using the power of Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs, RTX Video HDR allows GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their HDR panel\u2019s ability to display more vivid, dynamic colors, preserving intricate details that may be inadvertently rendered unidentifiable due to video compression.\nRTX Video HDR and RTX Video Super Resolution can be used together to produce the clearest livestreamed video anywhere, anytime. The combined features work on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and the VLC media player (via the RTX branch).\nRTX Video HDR will be released as part of new Game Ready and Studio Drivers later this month, and can be enabled via the NVIDIA Control Panel.\nGeForce RTX Livestreaming: Twitch, OBS & NVIDIA To Enable Multi-Encode Broadcasting This Month\nWhen setting up their broadcasts, most Twitch streamers must choose between a higher resolution output, or reliable streaming to more devices. High-quality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences, but causes streams to buffer for viewers with low bandwidth. Streaming lower-quality video allows more people to watch the content seamlessly, but introduces artifacts and renders content at a lower resolution.\nTwitch offers server-side transcoding for top-performing channels, meaning different versions of the same stream will be created for different bandwidth levels, improving the viewing experience. However, many channels are left with a single stream option.\nTwitch, OBS and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new feature to address this problem: Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting, releasing in beta later this month. With this new feature, GeForce RTX GPU owners will be able to broadcast up to three streams simultaneously; an increase to five encodes is planned for a later release.\nIn future updates, Twitch will test higher-input bit rates as well as new codecs, which will enable streamers to broadcast at up to 4K at 60 frames per second for the first time. The new codecs include the latest-generation AV1 for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, which provides 40% more encoding efficiency than H.264, and HEVC for previous-generation GeForce GPUs.\nGetty Images Releases AI Image Generation Tools Powered By NVIDIA Picasso\nToday, iStock by Getty Images is releasing a GenAI service built on NVIDIA Picasso, an AI foundry for visual design.

Not only did we get three brand new graphics cards, including one with a lower price, but we even got a sneak peek at Half-Life 2 running with RTX, and a whole lot of AI news.\nNvidia RTX 4000 Super - The Star of the Show\nAt CES 2024, Nvidia announced three new graphics cards: The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super. These new GPUs are replacing, well, the RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 at the same price points. The only difference is the RTX 4080, which is thankfully a little bit cheaper than 4080 was at launch.\nThe RTX 4080 Super is launching at $999, making it about $200 cheaper than the $1,199 RTX 4080. Meanwhile, the RTX 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super are launching at the same price points as their original versions at $799 and $599, respectively. But while these do feature a bit of a boost over the original versions, they really aren't for folks who already bought into the RTX 4000 series, rather these Super cards seem to just sweeten the deal a bit.\nNvidia claims the RTX 4080 Super can run pretty much anything at 4K with ray tracing enabled, while the RTX 4070 Super and 4070 Ti Super are a bit more modest, targeting either high-refresh 1440p gaming monitors or 4K. This is more or less what you can already expect out of the RTX 4070 Ti and the RTX 4070, but we'll see exactly how they stack out when we publish full reviews later this month.\nHalf-Life 2 RTX - Not Exactly Half-Life 3\nPiggybacking on the success of Portal RTX and Minecraft, Nvidia has worked with community modders to create a version of the beloved Half-Life 2 running with ray tracing, but the update goes beyond fancy lighting. It looks like there are all-new assets in some of the scenes, so it looks almost like a full remaster of the classic shooter, rather than just some RTX injection, like we got with Quake and Portal.\nNvidia didn't give any release date for this community update, but my gut is saying it may be out sooner, rather than later.\nNvidia also announced that Horizon Forbidden West will be launching with DLSS 3.0, which includes frame generation, along with DLAA for gamers with especially powerful PCs. The big difference between these is that DLAA renders the game at a higher resolution and then scales it down to your native screen size, rather than rendering at a lower resolution and upsclaing, as DLSS does.\nRTX Remix - Ray Trace Everything\nIf you've ever, for whatever reason, felt like your favorite game absolutely needed ray tracing to be brought to the next level, RTX Remix finally has a beta release date of January 22. This is a tool that will let you create your own little RTX remasters of your favorite games. We haven't had a chance to test this tool for ourselves, so I'm not sure how easy it will be to actually use, but it should be pretty straightforward. Only time will tell, though.\nAI Everything - Just Like Every Other Tech Company at CES 2024\nWe already knew AI was going to be a huge talking point at CES 2024, and Nvidia definitely showed that we weren't wrong. A vast portion of the company's CES 2024 presentation centered on AI, and how its GPUs are going to be powering local generative AI.\nFrom a chatbot that you can train with documents stored locally on your computer to image generation software that will take a written description and turn it into a fresh photograph, you can do all of this locally on your computer rather than using a website that's down more than its actually running correctly.\nNvidia also showed off AI-powered NPCs in games, that will supposedly be able to have dynamic conversations with you as you play. The demo seemed more like a text-to-speech program reading off from a ChatGPT output, but hey at least you can have conversations with a bartender in your video game, right?\nIn This Article\nIGNRecommends"

        "raw_content": "AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\nNVIDIA announced three new graphics cards, advancements in in-game NPC dev and robotics, and partnerships across healthcare and intelligent automotive.\nNVIDIA\u2019s revenue ballooned to $18.12 billion in Q3 fiscal 2024, up 206% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 34% from Q2 2024 as AI fuels the growth machine that the company has become. And it doesn\u2019t look like the cash registers will stop ringing anytime soon, nor will the innovation cease at NVIDIA.\nHowever, the company says not all things are AI this time around (only most of them are). The NVIDIA Special Address at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 was reserved for consumer tech, accompanied by multiple partnerships and advancements in robotics.\nAs such, NVIDIA showed off a host of new offerings at the grand event in Las Vegas, Nevada, though not everything it has in store as the company\u2019s flagship event approaches in March. Expect the company to share its latest full-stack tech offerings, including those for cloud and on-premise AI/ML development, at NVIDIA GTC 2024.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Special Address at CES 2024 also followed AMD\u2019s Advance AI showcase, leaving one to wonder if the American chipmaker is almost trying to one-up its fellow American counterpart, just as it did in terms of revenue in just the past year.\nLook at NVIDIA\u2019s key announcements at its Special Address at CES 2024.\nNVIDIA Special Address Key Announcements\n1. New graphics cards\nAs expected, NVIDIA introduced three new additions to its GeForce RTX 40 series: the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which are primarily gaming-oriented but are also being marketed as AI chips.\nHaving successfully conquered the cloud-based AI market, NVIDIA now seems set to test the AI PC space. Given the two companies\u2019 collaboration, Microsoft should emerge as the biggest buyer of NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips for its Surface line of laptops.\nAll three graphics cards are positioned a notch below the RTX 4090D, which caters to the Chinese market.\nAI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)The three cards offer almost twice the performance of their predecessors, thanks to the company\u2019s in-house Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) tech. Tech specs for the new hardware remain under wraps for now.\nGeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super cost $999, $799, and $599, respectively, and will be available to purchase in January. Compared to the $1,199 price tag for RTX 4080, RTX 4080 Super\u2019s higher performance should make it an attractive prospect.\n2. AI-driven NPC advancements\nAt CES 2024, NVIDIA demoed the latest advancement in the creation of and dynamic interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). At the heart of the new demonstration is of course, generative AI, NVIDIA\u2019s Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE), Audio2Face facial animation,\u00a0 and the company\u2019s partnership with Convai.\nAI algorithms, alongside a complex rendering process involving speech recognition of a player through Riva, conversion to text, processing by a large-language model (in the cloud), and reconversion to audio fed to the game and thus to the player via the NPC.\nIt is unclear how efficient the entire process is, especially in the context of online gaming.\nNevertheless, the company announced NVIDIA ACE and the entire NPC development process would be available as Ace Production Microservices only to partners. Some of the earliest studios to harness NVIDIA\u2019s new offering are Ubisoft, Tencent, NetEase, Inworld, Ourpalm, Charisma, UneeQ, and Convai.\nSee More: IT Spending in 2024: Three Key Trends\n3. NVIDIA Isaac\nNVIDIA is complementing its commercial and enterprise AI offerings with one for industrial applications. With NVIDIA Isaac and Jetson, the American chipmaker hopes to leverage generative AI for robotics.\nThe company outlined its two-brain approach to AI-based robotics involving two computers. The first, called AI factory, leverages NVIDIA\u2019s compute infrastructure and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms to simulate and train AI models.\nThe second one is designed to handle the robot\u2019s runtime environment.\nThe company highlighted that incorporated LLMs allow for a seamless experience for even a beginner. More than 1.2 million developers and 10,000 customers and partners rely on the two platforms.\n4. Important NVIDIA partnerships\nNVIDIA\u2019s new partnerships span multiple sectors, although two stand out.\nAutomotive sector: NVIDIA has partnered with four automakers who will leverage the company\u2019s AI tech stack to design intelligent driving systems. These include Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, Zeekr, and smartphone maker Xiaomi\u2019s EV segment.\nWhile Li Auto has signed up to adopt NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the other three companies will use DRIVE Thor\u2019s predecessor, NVIDIA Drive Orin.\nHealthcare sector: NVIDIA is working with biotech company Amgen to create foundational models for drug discovery. Amgen is expected to build AI models with NVIDIA\u2019s DGX SuperPOD data platform with 31 DGX X100 nodes and 248 H100 Tensor Core GPUs deployed at its subsidiary deCODE Genetics\u2019 headquarters in Reykjavik, Iceland.\nMeanwhile, Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Insilico Medicine will rely on the BioNeMo cloud APIs (in beta) for drug discovery.\nFurther, NVIDIA\u2019s partnership with Deepcell encompasses cell image analysis and multiple other AI-driven applications in cell biology.\nWhat was your key takeaway from NVIDIA\u2019s Special Address at CES 2024?

Including why the RTX 30 series did not receive any Super GPU variants and confirmation that RTX Remix's beta release will have enough features to allow someone to remaster a classic game from stem to stern fully.\nRead our full interview with Freeman below. Check out our Everything Announced roundup for more information on Nvidia's CES 2024 announcements.\nOver two years after the RTX 40 series launch, what kind of lessons has NVIDIA learned to improve the performance of the SUPER GPUs compared to the non-SUPER counterparts?\nJacob Freeman, GeForce Evangelist: Right. So for the Super, we look at it like a... We call it a kicker SKU. And so for that one, similar to the previous Super series we had on the RTX 20 series, we basically bumped up the performance. So 4080 gets a performance boost.\nThe 4070 Ti is moving from 12 gigs to 16 gig memory, with a performance boost, and the 4070 SUPER will also get a performance boost. So, in addition to that, these cards all have the same features that the 40 series have, like frame generation DLSS, supporting DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. So it's a pretty good option for gamers at 1440p, 4K resolution, or 1080p.\nWhatever resolution you have, these are great options for gamers who want to play the latest games at high framerates.\nWas there a reason why Nvidia decided not to make a Super series for the RTX 30 GPUs?\nJF: Yeah, I don't really have an answer on that one. I mean, it's going to come down to each individual product, if there's room to make improvements on products. We're always trying to make improvements to our products. Here, we had an opportunity to make the product faster, so now we have the Super series.\nThe RTX 30 series was just that good?\nJF: Yeah, it was pretty good.\nI want to talk quickly about the Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE as you guys are calling it. Now, Ubisoft and Tencent are some of the first developers and publishers to take advantage of this technology. Can you share anything in terms of how these developers are going to use it? Can we expect this in a game that might be coming out this year from one of these developers?\nJF: Yeah. Well, I don't have any announcements on games or release dates or anything. It would be best to talk to the developers, publishers, or whoever's using the technology.\nThe ACE demo is a really good example of how you can use the technology. Of course, you can use this technology in many ways, but that's just one example. Using it to create more immersive interactions with NPCs. Even if you want to implement it in a way where you don't want to talk to the NPCs, you can use it to create dialogue so that you can interact with the NPCs. It can create questions for the player and the responses.\nSo there are a lot of cool ways to use technology, and it's very exciting.\nGoing back to Ubisoft. Historically, they had a very long and in-depth relationship with AMD in terms of having their games optimized to use AMD hardware. With this somewhat partnership and collaboration you guys are doing right now, can we expect, hopefully, in the future, that Ubisoft will work more closely with NVIDIA to optimize games for NVIDIA GPUs?\nJF: Well, we have a good relationship with a lot of game developers, not just Ubisoft, and so we're always looking for ways to collaborate closer with our game developers and publishers. We hope to get Nvidia tech into as many games as possible because we think that the tech benefits all gamers.\nThat NVIDIA ACE demo was cool. I am curious to know if there are any plans in the future where NVIDIA may release this publicly so people can try out the ACE demo themselves and see what kind of conversations they can get out of those NPCs.\nJF: Yeah, I don't have anything to announce just yet. That definitely would be cool at some point to release it, but don't have anything at the moment to announce on that.\nNow, RTX Remix is releasing later this month in beta. It's not a full release, so there will be a few missing features. What kind of limitations can we anticipate?\nJF: Right. Yeah, I have nothing yet to announce on the specific limitations. But it is considered a beta, so most people are familiar with how beta's work in general. We're going to use that to collect feedback and make it better.\nCould I remaster a whole game like one of those classic games like The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind? Can I do that from the beta?\nJF: Yes. Obviously, this is designed for modders, right? So if you had modding knowledge and you were able to mod games, you could definitely use RTX Remix to remaster classic games, just like we did with Half-Life with Orbifold Studios who is using RTX Remix to remaster Half-Life 2. So yeah, absolutely.\nThere's no doubt that RTX Remix is one of the more exciting tools in the modern community to come out in the last several years. When can fans expect a full release of this software?\nJF: Yeah, I don't have any announcements on the actual release date, yet. But of course, with the open beta coming up, we hope to collect as much feedback as possible and make improvements to the software, and hopefully, we can release it soon.\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

There are other new RTX 40 Super GPUs expected to launch at CES 2024. We have a few speculated specifications of the RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Super, and RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics cards listed below.\nTalking about the performance, we will likely see a performance improvement in the neighborhood of 10%. That is roughly what we saw when Nvidia released an updated RTX 20 Super lineup. The improvements to the VRAM capacity are more significant,\nthough. Our RTX 4060 Ti review talks about how a higher amount of VRAM is required in 2023. This is especially true if you want to max out the graphics settings in new games.\nIs it time for a GPU upgrade?

something after clicking a link in this article.\nIntroduction\nContents\nCES 2024 is underway, and we are on the ground floor finding you all the latest, hottest news updates for launches.\u2002Today, NVIDIA is making many announcements, with AI at the forefront this year, you will see a lot of new software developments from NVIDIA in this area.\nIn addition, NVIDIA has some new GPU hardware launches to talk about as well, as it refreshes its GeForce RTX 40 series lineup with some new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER series GPUs and a slight change to the product stack in the midrange to upper-tier range of GPUs.\u2002Before we dive into all of that, however, let\u2019s take a look at some technologies that NVIDIA will be focusing on at CES, and throughout 2024.\nNVIDIA Ace\nLet\u2019s start where it all began, way back in 2006 when things like pixel engines, and compute became unified into one CUDA core inside NVIDIA GPUs with the GeForce 8800 GTX.\u2002This pushed forward demanding games at the time and provided very fast raster performance in gaming.\u2002It was a simpler time.\nThen evolved deep learning technologies in 2012, which would be the catalyst for neural rendering using Tensor Cores in 2018.\u2002This evolved into technologies like DLSS, and other features.\u2002Just recently, in 2023 NVIDIA introduced DLSS 3.5 with the ability to denoise ray tracing using deep learning models, greatly improving image quality.\u2002Now we are starting to see generative AI on the PC using these pieces of hardware together.\nIn 2024 NVIDIA foresees AI technologies evolving, and becoming a hybrid of features.\u2002One of these new features NVIDIA is called NVIDIA ACE, which is hybrid AI NPCs.\u2002This is what gamers have been waiting for, the day that the AI in games can actually become smarter.\u2002The demo NVIDIA showed is actually quite stunning.\u2002Imagine in a game, like Cyberpunk, you talk into a microphone and are able to ask NPCs questions and actually have them respond to your questions, or your actions that you dictate, in real-time.\nWhatever you are imagining, now multiply your imagination.\u2002This is actually pretty freaking amazing if I do say so myself.\u2002The inner workings are quite complex, but using the Convai Character API pipeline, large language models are used for processing, and this is an Unreal Engine Plugin.\u2002This uses a bunch of different routes of processing, but the potential is pretty amazing.\u2002While we saw the demo in real-time, it was just one custom-made scenario, having this work in a real game, and remaining performant, we will see.\nNVIDIA RTX\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX gaming support has been growing by leaps and bounds.\u2002There are now over 500 titles with some kind of RTX technology implemented.\u2002NVIDIA is announcing even more titles supporting RTX, such as Horizon Forbidden West with DLSS 3, PAX DEI with DLSS 3, Diablo IV with RT, and DLSS 3.\u2002Even some RTX Remix games like Half-Life 2 RTX, which is pretty exciting.\nThere are also more opportunities with GeForce Now and it is now in 110 countries and more coming online.\u2002Speaking of RTX Remix, RTX Remix Open Beta is arriving on January 22nd!\u2002It can help you create and re-master materials in older games easily with RTX and AI.\u2002Speaking of generative AI ISTOCK is now powered by NVIDIA Picasso for AI-driven photo generation.\nTwitch Enhanced Broadcasting\nThis is a very cool new feature, NVIDIA is announcing a new broadcasting ability that allows your GeForce GPU to encode up to 5 concurrent streams output to different resolutions and framerates for devices.\u2002As it is currently, when you stream out to Twitch you have one resolution and framerate output, but that may not work optimally for every device that a person is using.\u2002The quality will be vastly different, and each device will not optimally be getting the best experience.\nUsing OBS and GeForce GPUs you will be able to stream out at 5 different streams, resolutions, and framerate, to more optimally target users having different format devices.\u2002This does seem to be strictly with Twitch.\u2002New GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops are coming as well, several popular and well-known brands will be offering RTX 40 Series mobile GPUs inside.\nGSYNC News\nLastly, in monitor news, NVIDIA G-SYNC is continuing to improve, and a new feature called G-SYNC Pulsar is coming to the ASUS ROG Swift PG27 series in 2024.\nJoin the discussion in our forums...\nThermaltake Shows Off Its 25th Anniversary Kit
