Uninterrupted, stable, clean power for any indoor or outdoor activity is all in your hands.\nModular Design\nRUNHOOD\u2019s unique, award-winning design lets you build your own power bank or station based on your power needs.\nGet Full Power Instantly\nVirtually unlimited capacity. When batteries run low, simply replace them with a fresh battery. You stay running.\nBatteries Used Separately\nPop-out a battery and snap on a USB or AC adapter to use separately from the station.\nMultiple Charging Methods\nThe hot-swappable batteries can be recharged with 3 methods: solar panel, car, and wall outlet.\nCharge-Discharge Separately\nWith RUNHOOD\u2019s patented removable batteries, you can use power in one locale while charging spare batteries in another.\nMENTIONED BY TOP MEDIA\nRUNHOOD RALLYE 600 (648Wh)\n\"This RUNHOOD unit is the first modular-style portable power station I've been able to get my hands on, and I love what it means for the industry. Performance-wise, this model was about average, but it could offer you more in flexibility and convenience than many other units. This could be a game changer for trips where every member of the family is off in a different area draining some electronic device.\"\nReview of RUNHOOD RALLYE 600\n\"That explains why portable power stations are so popular these days. But most of them suffer from one key problem: When the power runs dry, you have to wait for it to recharge \u2014 if you even have the means to do so. RUNHOOD has taken a modular approach to this problem with the Rallye 600, a power station with swappable batteries.\"\nA modular solution for home and travel\n\"One such company is RUNHOOD, which has taken a modular approach to creating portable power solutions. Instead of offering a simple one-size-fits-all charging device, the company has built an entire ecosystem around its powerful batteries. Those power cells connect with a range of accessories, giving users multiple options for staying charged, both at home and on the go.\"\nOff-grid solar kit with quick-swap modular batteries\n\"What makes RUNHOOD\u2019s offering unique is its design built around external swappable batteries. The batteries can be linked together in the company\u2019s power bank, or removed to operate independently, charging and discharging with USB or AC adapters. This design offers a lot of flexibility for off-grid adventures and can lessen the load of carrying a heavy battery bank.\"\nIntroduction of RUNHOOD RALLYE 600\n\"This modular unit is the answer for those who need to be plugged in off the grid. It offers up to 648 Wh capacity, 1200W peak power, and 600W AC power that can be recharged via an AC plug at home or solar panels (sold separately). Keep several batteries charged then swap them out when you need them.\"\nRUNHOOD RALLYE solar generator\n\"Even the best solar generators only go so far when the sun doesn\u2019t shine. RUNHOOD\u2019s portable power solutions fix this with hot-swappable batteries, so you can pack plenty of precharged juice to keep your gadgets and your generator humming for days.\"\nInnovative power station system done right\n\"With other power stations, you either need to place it in a spot where it can be connected to a solar panel, or you have to take a break from using it in order to charge it from a wall outlet or car. RUNHOOD took their system a step further by allowing the battery packs themselves to be used standalone with either USB outputs including 100W power delivery or even a single AC port (up to 80 watts sustained).\"\nRUNHOOD offers award-winning, unique, \u2018infinite\u2019 portable power station design\n\"While a wide range of portable power stations have entered the market in recent years, the RALLYE 600 is unique in that it is the first to offer batteries that can be swapped out without cutting the power supply. In theory, this means that the RALLYE 600 can deliver \u201cinfinite\u201d power as long as its batteries are changed and recharged consistently.\"\nProducts\nAbout Runhood\nSupport\nContact Us\nCall: +1 (866) 685-9868(Mon-Fri, 8AM-5PM PST)\nEmail: service@runhoodpower.com\nAddress: 3980-D, Valley Blvd, Walnut, CA 91789, United States\n\u00a9 2024, Runhood Power Inc.. Powered by Shopify\nLet customers speak for us\nI was a backer of this product and have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. My initial reason for backing this product is the versatility it offers and unique design. This is not a copycat same old same old power station!\nThe battery packs can be used as their own power station (w/the DIY moduals) or inserted into the host to power/charge it with 1 or 2 battery packs. Usually mixing batteries with different states of charge or age is an issue, but not with this product. It really does feel like they thought of everything with this design.\nCharging is a snap with daul inputs up to 200w. A 100w USB C power supply is a good option to purchase if you don't have one. All methods of charging I have tried worked well. I have thrown about all I can at this thing and it hasn't skipped a beat. Charging can be from your cars power port, wall power supply, USB C and solar. I even used a 3rd battery to charge or supplement capacity using USB C.\nIt has pass-through charging, but it's not recommended while dual charging.\nHot swapping the batteries is easy. Just make sure it's one at a time and in the right orientation.\nThe SERI 100w solar panels are really nice, but a bit on the heavy side and really long. The panels have plenty of loops and grommets for mounting them. I usually use a ridgeline to hang my panels staking out the bottom for the right angle to the sun. What little testing I have done they worked fine. I haven't been able to test them or other panels in good sun yet. With the soon to be released solar to USB C adapter you will be able to charge 1 or 2 batteries at a time with solar!\nSo far my main testing is running my ICECO JP42 fridge that I use at home and camping. The power station displays 99 hours of run time at full charge with the frig on ECO mode set at 44\u00b0f. When the compressor kicks on it shows 46 hours of run time, but goes back up once it's cycled. I have used the power station as a UPS for the fridge using 100w USB C to charge and the 12v port to run the fridge without issues. Other than the usual issue of the cord loosing connection when bumped.\nIf you're looking for something with 600w of almost endles power and awsome options or just a great power bank to run your devices you should really look at what Runhood has to offer! So far I am impressed with my purchase and Runhood's quick responses, even the manual is well done!\nWould I buy this product again? Absolutely, already have! I will post some pictures soon after a camping trip.\nBonus! They do listen to feedback resulting in improvements and future additions. For those looking for more, I have a feeling they will keep innovating while not leaving their early adopters behind. \ud83e\udd14 A 4 battery 1200w 1296wh host in the works?\nThe hot swappable batteries and charging options are so unique and The idea of replacing battery is really smart. In this way I don't have to replace the whole thing when the battery out of work.\nWhile camping last weekend my Runhoods ran perfectly! While solor wasn't able to fully recover the batteries due to cloudy weather it was enough to keep operational for four days without needing to swap batteries.\nI have added two MC4 to Anderson adaptors and a 30' Anderson extension cable to my kit for remote panel setup.\nThe charging adaptor for the batteries will be a fantastic addition to top off my setup!\nPretty sure the guys complaining about ice runs will be looking into my setup.\nI have bought the RALLYE 600 Pro. It arrived in 4 days: perfect. The outer box had a small tear that did not affect the content: it could be improved. The battery bars came from the factory to around 20%, following the instructions I fully charged it before the first use.Two charge with host by wall input, two bars charged by solar panel. Thanks to this, the station with two bars provided power for all small appliances (mini refrigerator, lighting, TV, wifi,etc). I haven't tested charging using the car charger so I can't rate those aspects. In my opinion this set is totally recommended.\nThis product is awesome,everything fits perfectly, no slop on the fit and finish, everything operates as predicted. i love the concept of real portable power where you can take a portion with you for phones and laptop and hot swappable which gives it about 1500whs of power total with the extra power bars. i would like to see these guys do a much larger one for an RV, 30amp plug with at least 2500wh and hot swappable. only thing i suggest right now is energy bars have an option for quicker charging maybe introduce an MPPT module that can allow solar charging of the power bars while the main unit does its work inside or out of the RV."

RUNHOOD has the industry's original modular design patent and insertable power replacement system technology. The RALLYE 1200 modular power station has the characteristics of portability, high capacity, durability, and low maintenance. Products have up to 9 outputs so that they can cover multiple scenarios including home emergencies, outdoor travel, and disaster preparation.\nRUNHOOD\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8199/161049_4b64f5358487ebae_001full.jpg\nThe RUNHOOD power station series is the only product with battery bars that are swappable in the power station industry, providing hot swap function and an uninterruptible power supply. Its long and continuous battery lifespan and other features integrate to surpass the traditional all-in-one design. The swappable battery design allows users to choose different combinations of host engines and battery bars for their various power needs. Moreover, due to the compatibility of the battery bars among all RUNHOOD power station series, it is convenient for consumers to change or upgrade.\nIt also features the industry's first solar direct charging adapter. RUNHOOD currently makes the only products that can recharge battery bars directly using solar panels, which reduces the recharging time of the power station. Users can recharge the extra battery bars using the SC200 while the RALLYE 1200 is in use. When the power runs low, they will have a fully charged power station with just a simple battery replacement.\n\"We are excited to introduce our new modular power station to the market,\" Wenhao Yao,\nCEO of RUNHOOD said. \"We believe that our product will be a game-changer for anyone who needs reliable and portable energy, whether they are camping in the wilderness or experiencing an emergency power outage at home.\"\nKey Features\nAvailability\nThe RUNHOOD RALLYE Power Station is planned to be officially launched in April 2023. The Power Station will be available for purchase on Kickstarter.\nAbout RUNHOOD\nRUNHOOD POWER INC. is a Californian company backed by an outstanding team with abundant experience in Energy Storage Systems. The company aims to minimize the environmental footprint of the industrial Energy Storage System, making it more portable, safe and convenient. It is a young company and the Modular Portable Power Station is its first product. The modular design enables flexibility to fit different needs in various scenarios. Technically, RUNHOOD's product is a MINI Energy Storage System with multiple battery modules. With the unique swappable battery design, the power station can easily extend durability, to keep the home appliances running during any unexpected outages or emergencies, and of course, provide a joyful experience during outdoor activities.\nRUNHOOD is committed to advancing renewable energy within daily life. The company is continuously developing new product modules that offer even greater power. The upcoming product launch will feature a similar modular design but with increased power, and will remain compatible with existing modules. The use of the MINI ESS system will help users to integrate renewable energy into their daily lives. The company's ultimate objective is to achieve 100% renewable energy in all their products. RUNHOOD is dedicated to this goal and will continue to work towards making the Earth a cleaner, more beautiful, and sustainable place to live.\nMedia Contact\nWeb: https://www.runhoodpower.com/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/runhood_power_inc/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RUNHOODPOWERINC\nFor press inquiries, please contact\nContact: Sunny YuName: RUNHOODEmail: crowdfunding@runhoodpower.comCity: NEW YORK CITY, NYCountry: USA\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/161049\nSOURCE: Ankit\nSign up for Alerts\nSign up to receive news releases by email for Ankit or\nall companies belonging to the\nBanking/Financial Services industry.\nSign Up\nRecent News\nCompany Profile\nArticles from Newsfile\nHashtags\nSubjects\nSimilar Stories\nBanking/Financial Services\nTell Us Your Story\nAbout Us\nNewsfile is a customer-first newswire focused on the distribution of\npress releases and regulatory disclosures to audiences worldwide.\nLegal\nTerms of Use\nAnti-Spam Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nBill C-18\nCopyright 2024 Newsfile Corp.

Powered by Shopify\nLet customers speak for us\nI was a backer of this product and have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. My initial reason for backing this product is the versatility it offers and unique design. This is not a copycat same old same old power station!\nThe battery packs can be used as their own power station (w/the DIY moduals) or inserted into the host to power/charge it with 1 or 2 battery packs. Usually mixing batteries with different states of charge or age is an issue, but not with this product. It really does feel like they thought of everything with this design.\nCharging is a snap with daul inputs up to 200w. A 100w USB C power supply is a good option to purchase if you don't have one. All methods of charging I have tried worked well. I have thrown about all I can at this thing and it hasn't skipped a beat. Charging can be from your cars power port, wall power supply, USB C and solar. I even used a 3rd battery to charge or supplement capacity using USB C.\nIt has pass-through charging, but it's not recommended while dual charging.\nHot swapping the batteries is easy. Just make sure it's one at a time and in the right orientation.\nThe SERI 100w solar panels are really nice, but a bit on the heavy side and really long. The panels have plenty of loops and grommets for mounting them. I usually use a ridgeline to hang my panels staking out the bottom for the right angle to the sun. What little testing I have done they worked fine. I haven't been able to test them or other panels in good sun yet. With the soon to be released solar to USB C adapter you will be able to charge 1 or 2 batteries at a time with solar!\nSo far my main testing is running my ICECO JP42 fridge that I use at home and camping. The power station displays 99 hours of run time at full charge with the frig on ECO mode set at 44\u00b0f. When the compressor kicks on it shows 46 hours of run time, but goes back up once it's cycled. I have used the power station as a UPS for the fridge using 100w USB C to charge and the 12v port to run the fridge without issues. Other than the usual issue of the cord loosing connection when bumped.\nIf you're looking for something with 600w of almost endles power and awsome options or just a great power bank to run your devices you should really look at what Runhood has to offer! So far I am impressed with my purchase and Runhood's quick responses, even the manual is well done!\nWould I buy this product again? Absolutely, already have! I will post some pictures soon after a camping trip.\nBonus! They do listen to feedback resulting in improvements and future additions. For those looking for more, I have a feeling they will keep innovating while not leaving their early adopters behind. \ud83e\udd14 A 4 battery 1200w 1296wh host in the works?\nThe hot swappable batteries and charging options are so unique and The idea of replacing battery is really smart. In this way I don't have to replace the whole thing when the battery out of work.\nWhile camping last weekend my Runhoods ran perfectly! While solor wasn't able to fully recover the batteries due to cloudy weather it was enough to keep operational for four days without needing to swap batteries.\nI have added two MC4 to Anderson adaptors and a 30' Anderson extension cable to my kit for remote panel setup.\nThe charging adaptor for the batteries will be a fantastic addition to top off my setup!\nPretty sure the guys complaining about ice runs will be looking into my setup.\nI have bought the RALLYE 600 Pro. It arrived in 4 days: perfect. The outer box had a small tear that did not affect the content: it could be improved. The battery bars came from the factory to around 20%, following the instructions I fully charged it before the first use.Two charge with host by wall input, two bars charged by solar panel. Thanks to this, the station with two bars provided power for all small appliances (mini refrigerator, lighting, TV, wifi,etc). I haven't tested charging using the car charger so I can't rate those aspects. In my opinion this set is totally recommended.\nThis product is awesome,everything fits perfectly, no slop on the fit and finish, everything operates as predicted. i love the concept of real portable power where you can take a portion with you for phones and laptop and hot swappable which gives it about 1500whs of power total with the extra power bars. i would like to see these guys do a much larger one for an RV, 30amp plug with at least 2500wh and hot swappable. only thing i suggest right now is energy bars have an option for quicker charging maybe introduce an MPPT module that can allow solar charging of the power bars while the main unit does its work inside or out of the RV."

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Powered by Shopify\nLet customers speak for us\nI was a backer of this product and have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. My initial reason for backing this product is the versatility it offers and unique design. This is not a copycat same old same old power station!\nThe battery packs can be used as their own power station (w/the DIY moduals) or inserted into the host to power/charge it with 1 or 2 battery packs. Usually mixing batteries with different states of charge or age is an issue, but not with this product. It really does feel like they thought of everything with this design.\nCharging is a snap with daul inputs up to 200w. A 100w USB C power supply is a good option to purchase if you don't have one. All methods of charging I have tried worked well. I have thrown about all I can at this thing and it hasn't skipped a beat. Charging can be from your cars power port, wall power supply, USB C and solar. I even used a 3rd battery to charge or supplement capacity using USB C.\nIt has pass-through charging, but it's not recommended while dual charging.\nHot swapping the batteries is easy. Just make sure it's one at a time and in the right orientation.\nThe SERI 100w solar panels are really nice, but a bit on the heavy side and really long. The panels have plenty of loops and grommets for mounting them. I usually use a ridgeline to hang my panels staking out the bottom for the right angle to the sun. What little testing I have done they worked fine. I haven't been able to test them or other panels in good sun yet. With the soon to be released solar to USB C adapter you will be able to charge 1 or 2 batteries at a time with solar!\nSo far my main testing is running my ICECO JP42 fridge that I use at home and camping. The power station displays 99 hours of run time at full charge with the frig on ECO mode set at 44\u00b0f. When the compressor kicks on it shows 46 hours of run time, but goes back up once it's cycled. I have used the power station as a UPS for the fridge using 100w USB C to charge and the 12v port to run the fridge without issues. Other than the usual issue of the cord loosing connection when bumped.\nIf you're looking for something with 600w of almost endles power and awsome options or just a great power bank to run your devices you should really look at what Runhood has to offer! So far I am impressed with my purchase and Runhood's quick responses, even the manual is well done!\nWould I buy this product again? Absolutely, already have! I will post some pictures soon after a camping trip.\nBonus! They do listen to feedback resulting in improvements and future additions. For those looking for more, I have a feeling they will keep innovating while not leaving their early adopters behind. \ud83e\udd14 A 4 battery 1200w 1296wh host in the works?\nThe hot swappable batteries and charging options are so unique and The idea of replacing battery is really smart. In this way I don't have to replace the whole thing when the battery out of work.\nWhile camping last weekend my Runhoods ran perfectly! While solor wasn't able to fully recover the batteries due to cloudy weather it was enough to keep operational for four days without needing to swap batteries.\nI have added two MC4 to Anderson adaptors and a 30' Anderson extension cable to my kit for remote panel setup.\nThe charging adaptor for the batteries will be a fantastic addition to top off my setup!\nPretty sure the guys complaining about ice runs will be looking into my setup.\nI have bought the RALLYE 600 Pro. It arrived in 4 days: perfect. The outer box had a small tear that did not affect the content: it could be improved. The battery bars came from the factory to around 20%, following the instructions I fully charged it before the first use.Two charge with host by wall input, two bars charged by solar panel. Thanks to this, the station with two bars provided power for all small appliances (mini refrigerator, lighting, TV, wifi,etc). I haven't tested charging using the car charger so I can't rate those aspects. In my opinion this set is totally recommended.\nThis product is awesome,everything fits perfectly, no slop on the fit and finish, everything operates as predicted. i love the concept of real portable power where you can take a portion with you for phones and laptop and hot swappable which gives it about 1500whs of power total with the extra power bars. i would like to see these guys do a much larger one for an RV, 30amp plug with at least 2500wh and hot swappable. only thing i suggest right now is energy bars have an option for quicker charging maybe introduce an MPPT module that can allow solar charging of the power bars while the main unit does its work inside or out of the RV."

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

We are a professional review website that receives compensation from the companies whose products we review, usually in the form of the reviewed product. We test the products supplied to us, and the opinions expressed are our own.\nWhen you buy through links posted on our site, we may earn a commission at no cost to you.\nYou can learn more by clicking here.\nThe Lowdown\nThere is no question that the Runhood power system can get pricey. At the same time, by taking a modular approach, the company not only lets each consumer create the system that best meets their own needs, but it also allows for a degree of flexibility and expansion that is unique in the marketplace.\nPros\nCons\nWe have recently seen a proliferation of high-capacity batteries for hunting and camping and as a replacement for gas or propane generators when the power goes out. None, however, have the innovative design of the Runhood Modular Power Station system; its design lets you create the system that\u2019s right for you and then add to it as your needs grow.\nThis past summer, we endured our power company taking up residency behind my house for over a week as they trimmed back or cut down countless trees in the glen behind my house.\nWhile I was not too fond of the noise and miss the trees they took down, I understand why they felt the need to do so. Our power lines also run behind my house, and those trees inevitably cause power outages during winter storms.\nThe power company hoped that clearing the power lines of potential tree limbs would eliminate the constant power losses, and they were right! We have yet to lose power this winter. (But I still miss my trees.)\nAt the same time, history means I have taken steps to be better prepared for the next time the power goes out. This included purchasing a propane generator, which has proven to be loud and quickly burns through propane tanks. But after using it during two power outages twice last winter, it has seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.\nLarge-capacity portable battery banks are also a great solution. They usually won\u2019t run a full-size refrigerator, but they will keep most basic house electronics going for a significant amount of time.\nAdd in the fact that many come with cables, so you can recharge them using your car\u2019s power port or an optional solar panel, and you can keep the power banks charged for as long as you need them. We have reviewed several such portable power solutions, but none have the industrial design or flexibility of the Runhood Modular Power Station.\nMost of the large power stations in this category are large, boxy batteries with a utilitarian design. Inside are battery arrays and, on the top or front, a series of inputs and controls so you can recharge the battery and connect various devices that need power.\nBy contrast, the Runhood system takes a modular approach and, as a result, is far more flexible and customizable than anything we have previously seen.\nLet\u2019s dig into the system a bit.\nAt the heart of the Runhood system is the Runhood 600W Host Engine,\u00a0which on its own, retails for $349.\nThe 600W Host Engine includes the housing and controller, a number of cables, and a quick guide. Unlike similar products with a boxy, utilitarian design, the Runhood 600W Host Engine has gentle curves, a bright orange body, and a rounded handle.\nAll of these features combine to create a battery housing that is a bit more consumer-friendly from an aesthetic perspective.\nThe front face of the 600W has an LCD interface that provides a great deal of information, two US 110 outlets with \u201cpure sine wave 110 V 60Hz,\u201d a USB-C PD 100 bi-directional ports, a USB-C PD 100 output port, two USB-A 3.0 ports that deliver 28W, a bi-directional carport and two DC 60W ports.\nA 24V DC in port is available for charging via your home outlet, a car power port, or the Runhood solar panel.\nFinally, a built-in light is controlled via the LED button next to it.\nThe Runhood 600W Host Engine interface offers all the ports and connectivity options you\u2019ll need, encased in a refined package.\nBut the Host Engine is just one piece of this modular system, and it doesn\u2019t have any batteries inside; that\u2019s where the EB324 Energy Bars come in.\nAs noted, the front of the Runhood 600W Host Engine has all the controls and connectivity options. The back has two buttons and two rectangular caps. Pressing either button releases the rubber cap just beneath it and reveals a rectangular slot that runs from the back to the front of the 600W controller.\nEach slot can accept one Energy Bar 324 for 648W output power when both are charged and inserted; each battery measures 10.2\u2033 by 2.3\u2033 by 4.1\u2033, weighs under 4 pounds, and is rated to maintain 80% capacity after 1000 charges.\nA package of two EB324 batteries, AKA a Rallye Juice Pack, retails for $440; you can also purchase the batteries individually at $249, but the cost-savings when you buy two makes that a poor option.\nThe batteries can be recharged when plugged into the Runhood 600W Host Engine; they can also be recharged from solar with the optional $49.99 cables.\nWhy would you want to charge one of the EB324 batteries on its own? We\u2019ll get to that soon.\nCombining the Runhood 600W Host Engine with two EB324s creates what the company calls a Rallye 600. While you could buy each component separately (at a retail cost of ~$850), purchasing the Rallye 600 configuration will set you back $739 when it\u2019s not on sale.\nThe Rallye 600 setup can power a laptop for 10 hours, a light for 65 hours, a mini cooler for 10 hours, a TV for 10 hours, and a mini fridge for 9 hours. No, it won\u2019t power a full-size refrigerator; for that, you still need something more powerful.\nSo, in short, if you have the Runhood 600W Host Engine and two of their EB324 batteries, you have a 648Wh battery system for your next outing or power failure. But that begs the question of why this approach is advantageous compared to battery systems that lack a similarly flexible design.\nThe answer is twofold.\nFirst, the Runhood batteries are hot-swappable. That means you can purchase additional EB324 batteries, keep them charged, and then swap out a spent battery for a fresh one when necessary.\nOnce the spent energy bar has been removed, you can recharge it using your car battery or the solar panel and have it ready to swap back in when the time comes.\nThat\u2019s also the first reason it is important to charge each battery on its own.\nThe second reason is that each EB324 battery can be used as a power source when you purchase either the $95 Runhood 256W DC Engine or the $80 Runhood 110V/80W Engine. They each connect to the end of an EB324 battery and lock in place until two buttons, one on either side, are simultaneously depressed.\nThe Runhood 110V/80W lets you plug one device with a US110 plug-in while the Runhood 256W DC Engine provides a bi-directional USB-C PD 100W, a USB-C PD 100W output, and two USB-A QC3.0 28W outputs.\nThe beauty of this approach is that it means you can take significant power without the need to carry the entire Runhood system with you; that kind of flexibility makes this system special.\nThe Rallye 600 PRO bundle\nFinally, you can purchase a Runhood Seri 100W solar panel for $299. The panels are waterproof and foldable and can be used either as a single panel or as a pair for added power.\nEach panel offers a maximum output of 100W and makes it possible to keep the Runhood EB324 batteries charged, even when you are off the grid. I wasn\u2019t sent a solar panel with the review system to test, but I\u2019ll likely purchase one in the future and will update this review with their performance then.\nIt is good to know that various options for recharging your Runhood system exist.\nWhen the Runhood 600W is loaded with two EB324 batteries, it presents as a fairly standard power station. However, thanks to the company\u2019s modular approach, you can purchase additional batteries and hot-swap them with the ones in the Runhood 600W Host Engine, so you have zero downtime.\nIn addition, each EB324 battery can function as a standalone battery when you need to travel light. Best of all, you can start with a simple system and then, if your needs grow, expand the system without needing to purchase an entirely new power station.\nThe Rallye 600 PLUS bundle\nEven so, if you are considering the Runhood system, it makes sense to look at one of the bundles they currently offer.\nThe Runhood Rallye 600 includes the 600W housing plus two batteries for $739, while the Rallye 600 Plus includes all that and two additional batteries (a total of four) for $1219.\nThe Rallye 600 Max builds on the Plus model by adding the AC and the DC Engines, so you can use each battery on its own, while the $1659 Rallye 600 PRO includes everything in the Max setup plus one solar panel.\nEach of these bundles is currently on sale. Check the company website to check out the current sale prices.\nThere is no question that the Runhood power system can get pricey. At the same time, by taking a modular approach, the company not only lets each consumer create the system that best meets their own needs, but it also allows for a degree of flexibility and expansion that is unique in the marketplace.\nAs soon as the review sample came, I charged it up, but thankfully, we haven\u2019t needed it yet. And while I hope that continues, I know that if we lose power, we\u2019ll have the Runhood modular power station to help keep the lights on.\nSource: Manufacturer supplied review sample\nWhat I Like: Refined design is more attractive than the competition\u2019s industrial look; Top handle makes it easy to carry; Plenty of connectivity options for all your devices; Hot-swappable batteries let you customize the power of the system; When individual batteries are paired with one of the available \u201cengines\u201d they become usable on their own; Bundled price saves significant money\nWhat Needs Improvement: The modular system is great but adds to the complexity of using the Runhood; Includes a bag for cables but not for other accessories like spare engines\nThanks for Sharing!\nRelated\nAs an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.
