Guardian Generation 3 also features refined microsleep detection and eye-gaze tracking which enhances its ability to accurately detect distracted driving.\nSeeing Machines has been protecting commercial transport and logistics companies with its aftermarket Guardian solution globally, with over 14 billion kilometres of recorded travel across 54,000 vehicles. The third generation Guardian hardware also delivers a range of features that leverage the Company's proven automotive-grade algorithms and precision optics to deliver premium performance in the most demanding real-world driving conditions.\nAs operators around the world continue to seek out reliable safety technology for their fleets, so too are commercial vehicle manufacturers. This enhanced Guardian technology offers compliance certainty for these OEMs who can now implement the technology via factory-fit or \"after manufacture\" and offer their customers the opportunity to buy fully compliant, road-ready vehicles.\nPaul McGlone, CEO of Seeing Machines\u00a0commented: \"Regulation continues to drive demand for all of our DMS technology and I am very pleased to see that we have successfully launched the next generation of our Guardian solution for commercial transport and logistics companies as well as commercial vehicle manufacturers. A reliable solution that only activates when required is so important for driver adoption and continued road safety. Additionally, supporting commercial vehicle OEMs with an aftermarket (or factory fit) solution is critical to their ability to sell compliant vehicles. And, given the lower annual volume of production of these vehicles versus cars, I am delighted that Seeing Machines is able to service this new market segment profitably and continue to drive our purpose of getting people home safely.\"\nSeeing Machines' Guardian Gen 3 will be on display for private demonstrations at CES 2024.
