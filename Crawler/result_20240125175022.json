Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water. Coming out in the U.S. later this year, it will be priced somewhere up to $1000.\nSamsung fridge turned AI home hub\nSamsung has gone \u201call-in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its phones and home appliances. This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F. The result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIt uses artificial intelligence to monitor all aspects of the food, environment and cooking process. This includes the temperature and texture of the food.\nRobot vacuum phone home\nrobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to ability to call its owner, or have the owner call in remotely.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "raw_content": "CNN values your feedback\nMarkets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nWhat to expect at CES 2024: AI, AI and more AI\nThe first companion robot with ChatGPT, an AI \u201csmart belt\u201d that helps guide the visually impaired and AI-powered vacuums, mops and other appliances.\nComing off a year where artificial intelligence dominated headlines and attention across the tech industry, the new products launching at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show will not surprisingly be all about AI, too.\nCES 2024, now in its 58th year, will kick off this week in Las Vegas with an expected blend of cutting-edge technologies and quirky gadgets.\nThe event, which is the largest consumer tech conference of the year, is known for robots roaming the show floor, splashy presentations from big tech companies and the launch of oddball products, such as last year\u2019s buzzy $3,000 self-driving stroller and color-changing cars.\nBut the event is also a breeding ground for dealmaking among executives, manufacturers and retailers across various industries. It can set the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year and shine a spotlight on how companies intend to be part of those conversations.\n\u201cPerhaps the question to ask is what AI will not touch this year,\u201d said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at Forrester. \u201cChatGPT has fueled such a frenzy over the last year that companies feel the AI train is one they must scramble onto, even if they have no idea where it\u2019s going.\u201d\nChatterjee said to expect AI in everything such as chips and cards from companies including Intel and Nvidia, and consumer devices like refrigerators from Samsung with the \u201cAI Family Hub.\u201d Varying panel discussions will hit on AI\u2019s possible impact on jobs and ethical considerations.\nThe Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES each year, said it is expecting about 130,000 in-person attendees this year, up from about 115,000 last year and 45,000 in 2022 amid concerns of the Covid-19 Omicron variant. CTA is once again offering a livestream for some events this year.\nThe show will feature more than 4,000 exhibitors and 1,200 startups from all over the world. Featured speakers will include executives from companies such as Samsung, LG and Microsoft, as well as discussions with Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Apple, which is typically absent from CES, is once again not expected to participate.\nAbout 60% of the Fortune 500 companies will be in attendance, according to the CTA, enabling diverse product launches and discussions around all areas of tech and beyond. Beauty is now an official product category at CES, with L\u2019Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus delivering the company\u2019s first CES keynote.\nThe show also remains one of the fastest growing auto exhibitions in the world. Various forms of transportation, from floating and rolling to flying, will be featured this year.\nFor example, boating company Brunswick will show off electric boats and motors as well as self-piloting\u00a0recreational boats. VinFast, the Vietnamese electric vehicle company that only recently entered the US market, will unveil new models including a small SUV. And Hyundai will be there with an electric aircraft from its air taxi subsidiary Supernal.\nAs always, various automakers will also have exhibits showing off the latest in what people will be able to see and do inside their cars.\nBeyond AI\nFoldable displays, next-generation wearables and mixed reality-related accessories are also expected to get ample attention this year.\n\u201cExpect use cases [for AR and VR] beyond gaming like multimedia consumption and enterprise usage such as training, onboarding and collaboration,\u201d said Ramon Llamas, a director at market research firm IDC. \u201cIt\u2019s important for companies to stake their ground before Apple releases the Vision Pro later this year.\u201d\nNew wearable form factors will be on display, too. One gadget \u2014 called Dusk Rx, which is up for a 2024 CES Innovation Award \u2014 promises to be the world\u2019s first prescription-ready glasses that gives users control over the tint of their lenses via the frame or within an app. Meanwhile, a pair of high-tech leggings \u2014 also up for an Innovation Award \u2014 touts a high-tech microcurrent intended to boost athletic performance.\nSome companies could show off upgraded versions of previous innovations. Over the past few years, for example, voice-activated devices and smart speakers dominated CES as companies raced to add their voice assistants into everything from microwaves to toilets.\nWhile it was largely overestimated how consumers would use the technology, those same businesses could bring voice to the next level with generative AI, the technology that fuels products like ChatGPT.\n\u201cIt will be interesting to track whether a gen AI-powered capability can make the process of voice interaction far more intuitive and useful than before, resetting the clock on voice applications,\u201d Chatterjee said.\nAlthough CES overall is still a useful barometer to gauge market trends, the amount and diversity of the tech products on display makes it hard for anything to truly break through, noted Stuart Carlaw, a chief research officer at ABI Research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s akin to a group of blindfolded explorers trying to understand the full extent of the elephant they are interacting with,\u201d Carlaw said.\n\u201cThe one exception is AI,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an AI story, are you even a tech company?\u201d\nCES runs through Friday, January 12.\nCNN\u2019s Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Please try a different type of web browser.\nSamsung\u2019s \u2018AI for All\u2019 Vision Unveiled at CES 2024\nSamsung outlines strategy for using AI technology to make the connected device experience safer, more inclusive, and more energy-efficient\nSamsung Electronics today shared its vision for how artificial intelligence (AI) technology will enable people to experience their devices more intuitively and conveniently than ever before. Presenting these ideas at a press conference at CES\u00ae 2024, Samsung teamed up with key partners to outline the technology behind this vision and how new products and services use AI capabilities to make life easier.\nJong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman, CEO and Head of Samsung\u2019s Device eXperience (DX) Division, opened the press conference by describing how AI will enable connected technologies to improve people\u2019s daily lives while always remaining nonintrusive and \u201cin the background.\u201d The strategy that he and others outlined focused on the role of AI in enhancing connected experiences that are both simple and useful. Throughout the press conference, Samsung presented a number of products and services that help achieve these aims.\n\u201cWith the emergence of artificial intelligence, smarter, better experiences will redefine how we live,\u201d Han said. \u201cSamsung\u2019s broad portfolio of powerful devices, along with the pursuit of open collaboration, will help bring AI and hyper-connectivity to all.\u201d\nAI-Enabled Visual Display Products and Digital Appliances Bring New Experiences to the Home\nDuring the CES press conference, Jonathan Gabrio, Head of Connected Experience Center at Samsung Electronics America, outlined the ways in which AI technology is transforming how Visual Display products and Digital Appliances are used. For example, Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN900D boasts a built-in AI Processor, NQ8 AI Gen 3, equipped with an 8 times greater AI neural network and a two times faster NPU than its predecessor. Thanks to the NQ8 AI Gen3 processor, Samsung Neo QLED 8K automatically upscales low-resolution content to provide users with up to 8K quality viewing experience and sharpens fast-moving images via AI Motion Enhancer Pro. The Samsung Neo QLED 8K also features Active Voice Amplifier Pro, which analyzes voice and background noise by AI to optimize your TV listening experience so you can enjoy various content as if you are in the front row of a stadium or movie theater. Samsung Neo QLED 8K also features Tizen OS Home, which offers the latest apps, services, personalized content, and service recommendations to upscale your entertainment experience.\nAs for viewers with different needs, Samsung also provides innovative accessibility features. A sign language feature in Samsung Neo QLED can be easily controlled with gestures for the hearing impaired, and an Audio Subtitle feature turns text subtitles into spoken words in real-time for those with low vision.\nFurthermore, Samsung is introducing the new The Premiere 8K, a projector that features not only a 150-inch display, but also the world\u2019s first wireless 8K transmission for a projector. With The Premiere 8K, users will be able to enjoy a full-scale viewing experience like that of the cinema in the comfort of their own homes.\nAs for sound, Samsung also introduced Music Frame, a speaker with a customizable cover that integrates seamlessly into users\u2019 homes. Via Q-Symphony, the Music Frame syncs with Samsung TVs and soundbars, bringing enriched bass and surround sound of dual built-in woofers to the home with minimal effort.\nSamsung has also made major upgrades to Ballie, the rolling AI robot first introduced at CES 2020. Ballie has now evolved into your AI companion capable of interacting with other smart devices to provide customized services such as taking care of bothersome tasks or projecting images and videos on walls so that users can view key information for their daily lives such as weather or other relevant content wherever they are.\nTo enhance kitchen and food experiences, Samsung is unveiling the Bespoke 4-Door Flex\u2122 Refrigerator with AI Family Hub\u2122+1 2. This refrigerator boasts a 32-inch screen that features the new AI Vision Inside3, which uses an internal camera to recognize up to 33 different food items that are put into and taken out of the refrigerator and suggests recipes using those ingredients. Users can also set \u201cuse by dates\u201d on the Bespoke 4-Door Flex\u2122 Refrigerator with AI Family Hub\u2122 screen for food items, which then allows the refrigerator to send a notification when the set date draws near. By conveniently helping to save money by reducing food waste, these AI features enable more environmentally conscious lifestyles. The Anyplace Induction range takes AI connectivity a step further, as recipes saved on Samsung Food can be shared to the cooktop\u2019s 7-inch display so that users can easily follow along while cooking.\nSamsung\u2019s AI technology extends to appliances beyond the kitchen, as well. The new Bespoke AI Laundry Combo\u2122 \u2014 an All-in-One washer and dryer \u2014 features the AI Hub4, which is a 7-inch LCD display that acts as an intuitive control center for managing laundry, allowing users to enjoy a simple washing and drying experience. It personalizes washing and drying by remembering users\u2019 habits and using machine learning to suggest cycles. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s upcoming vacuum and mop robot cleaner, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\u21225, utilizes AI technology to provide a more convenient, effective cleaning experience. With AI Object Recognition upgraded from the previous robot cleaner lineup, it will be able to distinguish more objects, as well as detect stains and spaces6. The Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\u2122 also recognizes the type of floor it encounters \u2014 along with carpet length \u2014 and adjusts its settings accordingly.\nSamsung Reveals Galaxy Book4 as Company\u2019s Most AI-Ready Laptop Series Yet\nSamsung has been elevating what a PC can do and has been collaborating with Microsoft to create new, seamless connected experiences. Now, these experiences are being advanced further with new connectivity features that make the Galaxy Book4 series smoother, smarter, and more adaptable, reinforcing Samsung and Microsoft\u2019s commitment to providing the best PC experience possible.\nUsing intelligent, intuitive AI capabilities, Microsoft Copilot7 connects the Galaxy Book4 series with Samsung Galaxy smartphone to make them work seamlessly together, so that it feels like just one device. Microsoft Copilot can find, read or summarize text messages from a user\u2019s Galaxy smartphone and even automatically create and send messages on a user\u2019s behalf directly from the PC. Without having to turn on the smartphone and open each individual app, the Galaxy Book4 series can access smartphone functions and information more quickly and intelligently.\nThe Galaxy Book4 series can now turn Samsung Galaxy smartphones\u2019 powerful camera into a PC webcam8, using it for video calls on virtual conferencing apps. Users can switch freely between front and rear cameras with just a click on their PC, and it also offers a variety of features from Galaxy smartphones \u2013 including Background Blur and Auto-framing \u2013 that help focus on the speaker\u2019s image in any environment.\nThrough tight, ongoing collaboration between Samsung and Microsoft, more intelligent capabilities will continue to be made possible on the Galaxy Book4 series, with the above connectivity features being available starting from March.\nPlus, the Galaxy Book4 series can be paired with other Galaxy devices beyond smartphones. Tab S9 Ultra can be used as an additional PC monitor, and users can enjoy crystal-clear sound quality with reduced latency when the PC is connected with Galaxy Buds2 Pro. With all these capabilities and more, the Galaxy Book4 series is designed to deliver the best PC experience possible.\nBetter Connecting Users and Devices through Spatial Intelligence\nJaeyeon Jung, Executive Vice President and Head of SmartThings, highlighted the exciting new ways in which AI technology is impacting the relationship between users and their devices, including Samsung\u2019s vision for SmartThings: The more Samsung devices a customer uses, the smarter those devices become and the better they can understand and support daily life.\nSpatial AI is the key to enabling this vision, by helping devices understand the living space and routines of the user, thus enabling more a personalized home management experience. SmartThings uses LiDAR9 on connected devices like robot vacuums to create digital floor plans so users can easily check the status and location of all their devices. \u00a0And in March, SmartThings will roll out the upgraded 3D Map View for a more detailed experience on Samsung smartphones and TVs. Furthermore, a simple QR code will allow users to add family and friends to their SmartThings ecosystem, so that every member of the household can create their own routines.\nUsing smart sensors and AI, SmartThings will be able to detect unusual circumstances, such as a fall, and send alerts to designated family and caregivers10. \u00a0Also, thanks to the Galaxy SmartTag2, users can track their pets\u2019 activities and digitally store identifying information by attaching the tag to a collar or harness11.\nAnother point EVP Jung discussed was how the Bixby voice assistant is allowing smart homes to become more dynamic with its enhanced AI capabilities. Bixby can now automatically route commands to the most appropriate devices based on an understanding of the user\u2019s location and activities.\u00a0 Key technologies like Multi Device Wakeup combined with a shared communication protocol, enable Bixby to listen to commands with all the devices in a room but then only perform the requested action on the most relevant device. So if a user is in the kitchen watching a recipe video on their Family Hub\u2122, and they can call out, \u201cHey, Bixby! Play music!\u201d \u00a0At that point, music will play from the user\u2019s smart speaker, but the recipe video will continue to play on the Family Hub\u2122, uninterrupted.\nThe TV, with the Samsung Daily+ service, will increasingly become a central hub for much of this smart home functionality, while also granting access to a variety of additional services. These include video calls through ConnecTime, video veterinary consultation services12, and Workout Tracker \u2014 through which workout data can be transferred to Samsung\u2019s smart watches. Samsung also announced the new Samsung Now+ service, which displays useful information about users\u2019 homes, such as the weather or a live security camera feed from a home security system without the TV even being turned on. \u00a0As is the case with SmartThings features, users can also access this information via voice command.\nBringing the Home and Car Closer Together With Home-to-Car Capabilities\nSamsung also announced developments in the automotive industry, starting with a partnership with Hyundai Motor Group.\u00a0 Samsung and Hyundai have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which was announced ahead of CES 2024. Under the agreement, users will have access to Home-to-Car and Car-to-Home services, courtesy of SmartThings connectivity. Haeyoung Kwon, Head of Infotainment Development Center and SDV13 Execution Sub-Division at Hyundai Motor Group, delivered remarks regarding the partnership.\n\u201cUsing Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s software-defined vehicle, SmartThings will now work with Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis vehicles through the app,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cAll of us at Hyundai Motor Group appreciate our partnership with Samsung, and we\u2019re excited about the new features we\u2019re bringing to your vehicles through smarter connectivity.\u201d\nThrough SmartThings, users will be able to utilize voice commands to remotely perform functions in their car, such as heating it up in advance or opening and closing windows. SmartThings connectivity goes the other way, too, with users able to control home functions from their vehicle. Users will be able to automatically open and close garage doors based on the location of the car, as well as regulate home temperature. All of these actions can be carried out via voice commands.\nAdditionally, Samsung has further deepened the longstanding partnership with HARMAN to elevate the way users experience driving. Michelle Gattuso, Vice President of Product Management at HARMAN, discussed how the two companies are building new technologies to elevate the driving experience.\n\u201cSamsung\u2019s leadership in consumer technology \u2014 together with HARMAN\u2019s automotive expertise \u2014 has opened the door to game-changing experiences like HARMAN Ready Care, Ready Vision and Ready Display,\u201d Gattuso said. \u201cBut now, the work we do with Samsung is getting even more integrated. Samsung and HARMAN are working in lockstep to bring even more impactful experiences to the entire in-cabin ecosystem.\u201d\nHARMAN\u2019s Ready Care, which focuses on driver safety, implements deep learning neural networking techniques to monitor the driver\u2019s movement and cognitive alertness, and can provide personalized reminders and alerts. Additionally, Ready Care can now identify whether passengers are adults or children, and adjust airbag deployment settings accordingly.\nFurthermore, Ready Vision brings an intuitive display directly to windshields \u2014 courtesy of augmented reality \u2014 in drivers\u2019 line of sight, right when they need it. For example, drivers have access to a map that updates according to routes in real time, as well as recommendations for the fastest route or where to stop for coffee. Another HARMAN product, Ready Upgrade, allows automakers to frequently update their vehicle\u2019s hardware and software. This keeps vehicles relevant, modern and efficient for longer.\nSamsung Focuses on Security and Privacy Across Devices\nIn this future of AI-enabled, deeply interconnected devices, Samsung recognizes that security and privacy are paramount. Shin Baik from the Mobile eXperience Security Team discussed the company\u2019s security solutions as a foundation for the hyper-connected era.\nOne such solution is Samsung Knox Matrix, which now provides end-to-end encryption across many Samsung Galaxy smartphones and smart TVs. The technology will allow devices to monitor each other to identify and isolate security threats. Knox Vault, which helps keep user data safe on some of Samsung\u2019s most popular devices, has been expanded to cover more devices connected by SmartThings, such as Samsung Neo QLED 8K TVs. Additionally, Samsung\u2019s partnerships with major tech companies allow users to experience security and privacy in a way that is tailored to their specific needs.\nSamsung Makes Strides in Responsible Materials, Energy Management, and Accessibility\nMeanwhile, Inhee Chung, Vice President of the Samsung Corporate Sustainability Center, highlighted Samsung\u2019s plans for a more circular economy. As part of these plans, Samsung increasingly incorporates recycled materials into its products \u2014 including recycled plastic sourced from discarded fishing nets in Galaxy devices14, recycled plastic in TVs, and recycled aluminum in Bespoke refrigerators15. Additionally, the company\u2019s Certified ReNewed program \u2014 available in the U.S. and select European countries \u2014 offers affordable refurbished phones, while Galaxy Upcycling allows consumers to reuse or repurpose their old phones in creative ways. The company plans to scale up recycling and upcycling, as well.\nAs for the ways Samsung\u2019s technology contributes to sustainability efforts, the company is utilizing AI to make the use of its products more energy-efficient through features like SmartThings AI Energy Mode, which automatically optimizes energy usage to help users save electricity. These features are yet another example of how AI technology will not only make lives easier, but also allow consumers to live in a way that is more environmentally and economically responsible.\nThanks to a new collaboration with Tesla, SmartThings Energy is becoming even more useful both inside and outside of the home. The collaboration has integrated SmartThings Energy with Tesla products, including electric vehicles (EVs), the Powerwall home battery, Solar Inverter and Wall Connector EV charging solution. \u00a0Another benefit is that SmartThings Energy users can take advantage of the Tesla app\u2019s Powerwall \u201cStorm Watch\u201d function, which flags severe weather through SmartThings not only on the Tesla app, but also on users\u2019 connected Samsung TVs and mobile phones. SmartThings can also help users prepare for power outages by activating AI Energy Mode to extend the usage time of backup energy stored in their Tesla Powerwalls.\nSamsung is adding new features to increase device accessibility, such as digital appliances responding to hands-free gestures. Additionally, mobile devices provide auto-generated captions during calls, and TVs and displays offer a new, AI-enabled text-to-speech feature that converts subtitles into spoken audio. To further aid those with low vision, Relumino Together is a new viewing mode on Samsung TVs that enables users of all abilities to watch TV together, with or without visual adjustments. Now, everyone can enjoy home entertainment together at the same time.\n1 Product name is for North America only.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n6 trends to watch for at CES 2024: AI everywhere, Meteor Lake laptops, smart appliances, metaverse, and more\nA really big show\nThe future is just around the corner -- and you'll be able to catch a peek of it in early January. Every year, the technology industry gathers in Las Vegas for CES, an annual tech industry expo where the year ahead in products is previewed, tested, and talked about. It\u2019s like catnip for the technology world.\nTraditionally, CES highlights include flat-screen TVs, soundbars, and other consumer electronics, and for the curious, TechRadar has a great round-up of what to expect from CES 2024. I don\u2019t foresee much revolution in those traditional spaces landing at this year\u2019s show. But that doesn\u2019t mean innovation has slowed; here\u2019s my take on the biggest trends that will shape the show, and the products and innovations I\u2019m expecting to see \u2013 as well as those I\u2019d like to see more of.\nAnd since CES is also the launchpad for more hype than a rap record, I\u2019ve highlighted a few areas where the hot air will be hottest.\n1. AI everywhere \u2013 especially on your laptop\nArtificial Intelligence has been driving consumer electronics for ages now. Half a decade ago, I spoke with LG Electronics President and CTO I.P. Park, who told me AI could simplify complicated systems and help people get more out of their gear. \u201cWhen you\u2019re driving a modern luxury car most people are probably using only five percent of the entire feature set of the car,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s too complex \u2026 what AI will hopefully do is solve the problem of using complex systems so that the devices become smart. And smart devices will know exactly what you want,\u201d Park added. Everything LG makes would include it, he said.\nSo how much progress has been made in the last five years? Not all that much, I\u2019d argue. Until last year, that is, a watershed period that debuted generative AI (for better or worse), chatbots, and Microsoft\u2019s announcement that it would bake AI into a revolutionary new version of Windows expected for sometime next summer. They\u2019ll probably call it something horrible like Windows 1124H2, but think about it as Windows 12. And at CES 2024, AI PCs built for it will be all over the place.\nOn Dec. 14, Intel unveiled Meteor Lake, its newest chipset, which includes for the first time a dedicated AI processor component, called an NPU or Neural Processing Unit. AMD beat them to the punch, announcing at last year\u2019s CES the Ryzen 7040 notebook processors, which incorporate \u201cAMD XDNA AI\u201d \u2013 again, dedicated AI support. And at CES this year, we expect most major laptop manufacturers will unveil their AI PC lineups. Watch for huge, splashy reveals from Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer, Asus, MSI and more.\n2. Appliances get Serious AI\nBut what about Park\u2019s comments? Is your vacuum today AI-powered? Does your iron know just how much steam is too much? If AI is in all things, surrounding us like the Midi-chlorians that let Luke use The Force, why aren\u2019t our appliances better? Yes, today's washers and dryers use AI to sense humidity levels and adjust accordingly. But is this AI? Does this require intelligence or merely better sensors? And no standard-size oven can, for example, detect whether your Thanksgiving turkey is perfectly moist.\nWill CES 2024 change that? Doubtful, at least for traditional, full-size devices. Although fascinating advances continue: I\u2019m particularly impressed by Whirlpool, which will be showcasing a range of new appliances with SlimTech insulation, a proprietary material that can replace the bulky polyurethane foam in the walls of your current fridge. SlimTech can reduce the wall thickness by up to 66 percent -- allowing for up to 25 percent more capacity. Amazing! In 2023 LG showed off MoodUp, a color-changing fridge meant to one-up Samsung\u2019s beautiful Bespoke French door refrigerators. What will this year bring?\nApparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone.\nTo see the biggest changes, narrow your gaze: Look to the smaller, smarter countertop devices that have proliferated in recent years from June, Brava, and Anova. Those devices have limited AI built-in, nothing to rival the advances seen over the last year, but a ton more than traditional kitchen gear. And then there\u2019s Seer Grills, which recently launched Perfecta, billed as \u201cThe World\u2019s First AI-Powered Grill.\u201d Apparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone. And we\u2019ve seen remarkable new devices from GE\u2019s Profile division, which recently unveiled a countertop nugget ice maker. Will the new year bring anything new? We\u2019re looking at you, GE\u2026\nAnd one space in particular is thriving: robot vacuum cleaners. With household names like Eureka and Roomba competing against lesser-known names like Narwal and Ecovacs, it\u2019s going to be a messy fight. (See what I did there?) And there\u2019s plenty of innovation: At IFA 2023 in Berlin, Switchbot launched a vacuum that connects directly to your water pipes, letting it wash itself clean before going back to work for you. And since Matter unveiled support for robovacs in 1.2 of its sorta useful spec, they should hopefully work more seamlessly with all of your other digital gear. Maybe Matter will matter?\n3. Smarthome: Here comes the smart grid\nSpeaking of the smarthome, the industry is evolving.\nWhole-home chargers and solar power cells have become an enormous focus for the consumer electronics industry, as the power industry \u2013 at last \u2013 gets smarter. It\u2019s a logical advancement from companies that make batteries and chargers, starting with powerhouse names like Anker, which unveiled the Solix brand in June and will likely reveal more in the lineup at CES. Think of Solix and its ilk as giant battery packs for your house. Its largest capacity 180kWh array can apparently keep the lights on in a typical house for a whole week, which could come in handy if your local grid is impacted by extreme weather.\nLook for news from Jackery as well, which was named to TIME\u2019s Best Inventions of 2023 for its Solar Mars Bot \u2013 how cool is that? And there are dozens of companies looking at the home battery space, from big names like Schneider Electric and Bluetti to newcomers like Exeger and Ugreen and Goal Zero (and its $4,000 YetiPRO portable power station) and more.\nIt\u2019s also a place for new brand names to flourish like flowers under a solar-powered grow lamp (which you can also find at CES). And innovation in general: Samsung recently added the first ever EV charger to its SmartThings platform, letting users better manage and monitor the charge in their electric vehicle, as well as a partnership with Eve Energy to let you keep tabs on how much juice everything in your home is sipping.\nOne interesting twist on the standard battery comes from Palo Alto, California, start-up Coplanar, which sells portable hydrogen power generators and whole-home energy products. It\u2019s a renewable clean energy source using a chemical reaction rather than combustion, producing only water and heat as byproducts. Hydrogen power\u2026what could go wrong?\n4. Cars go electric, not autonomous\nWhile the worlds of tech and automotive seem to be racing at each other faster than Vin Diesel and his pals, the market for self-driving cars has already burst like a punctured tire. GM\u2019s Cruise self-driving car company lost $1.4 billion in 2022 alone, and Ford took a drubbing, writing off $2.7B in 2022 and noting in its earnings report that it would shift focus from the Level 4 autonomous systems being developed by Argo AI to driver-assistance tech such as adaptive cruise control and lane-switching assistance.\nThe market for self-driving cars has burst like a punctured tire.\nThis means there will be tons of real-world tech on display at CES 2024, actual stuff you can actually buy today for your next actual car. Will Chrysler and Tesla continue to lead the driver-assist world? Only time will tell.\nOf course, EVs will be all over the show, and rightly so. 2020 saw around 3 million in global EV sales; by 2023, that had rocketed to 10.25 million, and the number is predicted to hit the 17 million mark in five years. Electric vehicles are moving towards the software-defined vehicle (SDV) category, which means much of the vehicle's functionality (and even its powertrain) can be tweaked and updated via over-the-air updates (OTA). Ford recently discussed its plans for SDV features. Look for other makers to detail similar plans at CES.\nMeanwhile, tech companies continue chomping at the bit to get into cars. Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Huawei are jumping headfirst into this space, and we expect to hear from numerous other electric car startups, including Lucid, Polestar, Fisker, and Faraday Future. Okay, maybe NOT Faraday Future.\n5. Health-tech for women rules the world\nThe intersection of health and tech is a key space for CES, which explains the explosion in panels, keynotes, and conversations at the show on the topic. Among those speaking at CES are Linda Anegawa, Noom\u2019s Chief of Medicine; Jesse Ehrenfeld, President of the American Medical Association; Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna; and Gail K. Boudreaux, president and CEO of Elevance Health.\nThey reflect all aspects of the wide world of health, from award-winning pacemaker innovations from healthcare giant Abbott to smart beds, health monitors, fitness gadgets, digital doctors, and more. But one space stands head and shoulders above the rest: women's health.\nSometimes called femtech, innovations to help monitor, maintain, and improve women's health have been the source of many fascinating innovations lately. For just one example, consider the Evie smart ring from Movano Health, which debuted at CES 2023 and uses AI to connect the dots between menstrual cycles and sleep habits, among other things. In August the company filed for FDA clearance as a medical device; it finally ships in January, the company says.\nAnd expect day-to-day innovations in beauty tech, where smart mirrors and makeup aides are robotic wonders. L\u2019Oreal has an enormous history of innovation here: Last year it unveiled a computerized makeup applicator and the first at-home electronic eyebrow applicator. In 2017 it was a smart hair brush that we called \u201cthe combing coach you never knew you wanted.\u201d What will 2024 bring?\nThere's tech for all genders, of course. Withings has made a name for itself in the smart health space: The company invented the connected blood pressure monitor in 2011. And it continues to innovate on health gadgets: We have it on good authority that the company plans a multipurpose handheld device that looks intriguing for 2024. And we were impressed by NuraLogix at CES last year, which fairly accurately measures your blood pressure simply by taking a 30-second video. We\u2019re hoping this tech becomes a functional product in 2024.\nIf you\u2019re walking the show floor, look for an array of smart beds and massage chairs that always manage to give me a jolt of fresh energy. (Why don\u2019t I have one of these at home yet?)\n6. Hypewatch: VR/AR/MR, 6G and more\nIs it silly? Maybe! Is it over-hyped? Absolutely! Dare we call it just plain vanilla preposterous? You bet we do! But there are nonetheless advancements and work being done in augmented reality that might lead to an augmented future \u2013 with or without Mark\u2019s Meta.\nSoundscape makes a musical metaverse based on Unreal Engine 5, supporting avatars for an interactive VR music festival, for example. The company recently announced partnerships with GRiZ, Slash, Evanescence, Goose, and more, and promises additional partnerships with prominent labels before and after the launch at CES 2024. Heck, I\u2019d like to see a virtual concert. And VR for healthcare is absolutely a positive use of this technology. From immersive virtual reality and augmented reality for PTSD treatments to haptic feedback that can help restore lost senses, there\u2019s some reality amid the muck.\nAR is also just fun, with VR for cars, AR for astronauts, and MR for everything in between. But will it touch your life any time soon? We really, really doubt it.\nMeanwhile, watch out for big companies to slip the term 6G into presentations and displays. We know what you\u2019re thinking \u2026 and we\u2019re right with you.\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nAfter 25 years covering the technology industry, Jeremy Kaplan is a familiar face in the media world.

        "raw_content": "CNN values your feedback\nMarkets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nAt a 2024 consumer electronics show, AI gets companies on the same page\nFollow:\nCompanies big and small showed off new AI-powered products and their AI-inspired visions for the future at the world\u2019s biggest tech convention this week in Las Vegas.\nThere were pillows that can reduce snoring, mirrors that can detect your mood and innovations from pet-like companions to cars that integrate with viral chatbot ChatGPT.\nBut this year\u2019s announcements hit differently from previous buzzy developments, such as the Metaverse or adding voice assistant technology to appliances. That\u2019s because nearly every company appeared to be on the same page in 2024.\n\u201cIt was an almost unanimous tethering to the AI theme \u2026 because it has infinite possibilities and a wide range of applications,\u201d said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at market research firm Forrester.\nPrevious themes had \u201climited universal appeal,\u201d he added.\nAlthough CES is a hotbed for dealmaking among executives, manufacturers and retailers across various industries, it can also set the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year and shine a spotlight on how companies intend to be part of those conversations.\nThis year, non-tech companies including Walmart and L\u2019Oreal held keynote presentations to discuss their AI visions for the future, which largely included adding generative AI solutions to help customers better find the products they want.\nAt the same time, Amazon gave updates on how some of its developers are integrating similar technology with their Alexa voice assistant. Even some automakers, such as Volkswagen, said they will be adding the viral chatbot ChatGPT to their lineups of cars later this year to help drivers control GPS, the infotainment system and options like heating and cooling, as well as to get answers to general questions.\n\u201c[These announcements] demonstrated how companies are first prioritizing customer needs and then figuring out how technology can best serve them,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cThat\u2019s a far cry from exhibiting cool tech in search of a use case.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also part of a larger shift happening at CES, from technology powering experiences to experiences powered by technology. To help further that change, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD unveiled new processors that will help run the next-generation of AI products.\nJitesh Ubrani, an analyst at market research firm IDC, agreed the chatter around CES felt unique this year as companies had a general understanding of \u201chow ubiquitous and seamless AI will be in the coming years.\u201d\n\u201cWhile many use cases are still unknown, what we do know is that no one wants to be left behind, so they\u2019re starting to invest even before the products and use cases are fully fleshed out,\u201d he said.\nBeyond AI, other products stood out, too. Samsung wowed onlookers with the world\u2019s first transparent MicroLED screen, which looks much like a floating sheet of glass. EssilorLuxottica showed off a prototype of its Nuance Audio eyeglasses that also feature built-in hearing aids. And Sony teased a mixed reality headset that can be controlled with a smart ring.\nBut considering CES 2024 was the first large-scale tech convention since the surge around AI last year, Eric Abbruzzese \u2014 a director at market research firm ABI Research \u2014 said \u201cit\u2019s no surprise AI was everywhere.\u201d\nHe expects AI to dominate the tech world conversation not only throughout the rest of the year but beyond.\nOne caveat, however, is how the AI space will adapt to potential regulations, as government bodies and the White House aim to address the rapidly evolving technology.\n\u201cShould a regulation tamp down on AI growth in the name of privacy, security or if a big negative news event ties back to AI, then companies will work to shift messaging away \u2013 at least somewhat \u2013 from AI,\u201d Abbruzzese said. \u201cEven if their product is still using AI, the ultra-focused AI marketing may diminish.\u201d\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.
