This update replaces the VESA certified DP40 ultra-high-bit-rate (UHBR) cable specification with a new VESA certified DP54 UHBR cable spec to enable up to four-lane UHBR13.5 link rate support (a maximum throughput of 54 Gbps) over a two-meter passive cable. As a result, the DisplayPort 2.1a update effectively doubles the passive cable length for UHBR13.5 GPU-to-display connections\u2014which previously could only be supported through a DP80 UHBR cable\u2014providing consumers with greater flexibility in their gaming or workstation setup.\nVESA also announces it has published a new Automotive Extension Services protocol specification for both DisplayPort 2.1a and the latest version of VESA's Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) specification, version 1.5a. This new protocol extension provides support for automotive display functional safety as well as secure integrity and authentication for up to 16 display regions of interest. With the VESA Automotive Extension Services protocol, VESA has for the first time established a standard for vehicle displays that can enable display safety engineers to achieve ISO 26262 ASIL-D* \u2013 the holy grail of electronic safety integrity. Silicon manufacturers are already adopting VESA's Automotive Extension Services protocol today for chipsets that will be integrated in future vehicles.\nVESA executives will be available to discuss these and other important updates with VESA's standards at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), taking place this week in Las Vegas, January 9-12, 2024.\nLonger UHBR Cables for Greater FlexibilityWith the DisplayPort 2.1a update, the new DP54 cable specification enables support of both UHBR10 and UHBR13.5 sink and source devices with passive cable lengths of up to two meters. Monitors enabled with UHBR13.5 can drive resolution/refresh rate combinations as high as 8K2K at 240Hz or 8K4K at 120Hz over four lanes. While VESA is eliminating the DP40 cable spec, existing DP40 cables that have been shipped to date have been confirmed by VESA through rigorous testing to be compliant with the DP54 cable spec and support UHBR13.5 link rates. Sink and source devices supporting UHBR20 link rates (a maximum throughput of 80 Gbps using all four lanes) continue to be supported by VESA certified DP80 UHBR cables.\n\"With the latest update to DisplayPort, the UHBR13.5 cable spec is now purpose built to provide both UHBR10 and UHBR13.5 monitors and graphics cards with a longer passive cable. Consumers are no longer limited to connecting UHBR13.5 sink and source devices with a one-meter DP80 cable, which provides more bandwidth support than what their hardware needs and, in some cases, might be too short for their set-up, for example with ultra-wide curved displays,\" stated James Choate, compliance program manager for VESA.\nMaking the De Facto Standard for Vehicle Displays Even BetterAs vehicles become more advanced and connected, the number of high-resolution interior displays in automobiles is on the rise. These displays provide a wide variety of critical information that drivers need to operate their vehicles safely and efficiently. Most automotive displays currently use DisplayPort or eDP to carry video data from the central vehicle computer to the displays. In addition to its high video bandwidth capability, DisplayPort features Multi-Stream Transport (MST), which enables multiple displays to be connected to a single DP source port. However, until now, there was no standardized way to verify that the data transmitted from the GPU was received by the display in the same way that it was sent, ensuring it is free of noise injection or errors.\nVESA's new Automotive Extension specification protocol addresses this need, adding critical safety and security protocols on top of the existing DisplayPort 2.1a and eDP 1.5a spec. It features a mandatory functional safety profile for the main data path and metadata that uses very-high-safety-rated cyclical redundancy check (CRC) polynomial mathematical signatures for every frame of video data across the data path. This ensures that a frame never gets dropped or repeated so that critical events are always captured and never missed.\nThe protocol also features more advanced optional profiles that provide functional safety for the DisplayPort Aux channel, which carries command and control data for the video source device; security authentication and integrity checking on the data path, to prevent unauthorized tampering with the video data or the physical displays themselves; and encryption of the DisplayPort Aux channel, to prevent hackers from reading information on the types of displays in the vehicles that could be used to tamper with the displays.\n\"Displays are increasingly being integrated into automobiles, which provides a valuable infotainment resource for drivers and passengers but can also create opportunities for safety errors and data breaches if not properly secured,\" stated Bill Lempesis, executive director of VESA. \"As the world's leading standards body for the global display industry, VESA takes automotive display safety and security seriously. Leveraging the latest versions of DisplayPort and eDP with VESA's Display Stream Compression (DSC) codec, our new Automotive Extension Services protocol can handle the safety and security needs of virtually every safety-critical display in the vehicle from a single cable. We are issuing a call to electronics, displays and automotive manufacturers to join our efforts in continuing to shape this new Automotive Extension Services protocol to address the future challenges and needs facing the automotive industry and consumers.\"\nThe VESA Automotive Extension Working Group, which is driving the new Automotive Extension specification protocol, is open to all VESA members. For companies that are not currently members but would like to participate, please visit https://vesa.org/join-vesamemberships/ and complete the application form to become a member.\nNote to Editors: Members of the press attending CES 2024 that are interested in a private tour of VESA's VIP suite at the Palazzo Hotel to meet with VESA executives to learn more about VESA display standards, including the new Automotive Extension specification protocol, as well as see product demonstrations first-hand, can contact David Moreno at Open Sky Communications by email at [email\u00a0protected].\n* ISO 26262 is an international functional safety standard for road vehicles that addresses hazards caused by the malfunctioning behavior of electronic and electrical systems installed in the vehicles.

You either care about VESA standards or you don\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen enough iffy monitors to see the value of VESA. The update to the Adaptive-Sync Display standard brings significant improvements to DisplayPort technology. The most notable enhancement is the introduction of the UHBR13.5 cable spec, which is specifically designed to support both UHBR10 and UHBR13.5 monitors and graphics cards. This update enables longer passive cables, eliminating the previous limitation of a 1-meter DP80 cable, and provides more bandwidth support. It particularly matters for setups involving ultra-wide curved displays.\nAs vehicles become more advanced and connected, the demand for high-resolution interior displays is increasing. These displays provide drivers with essential information for safe and efficient vehicle operation, especially as the EV trend puts more and more data on-screen. One advantage of DisplayPort in cars is its Multi-Stream Transport (MST) feature, which enables the connection of multiple displays to a single DP source port. Previously, there was no standardized method to verify that the data transmitted from the GPU was received by the display accurately and without any noise or errors.\nThe updated Adaptive-Sync Display standard introduces a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the data transmitted between the GPU and the display. This helps to eliminate any potential noise injection or errors that may occur during transmission.\nUpdates from VESA bring improvements to cable support and data transmission verification, enhancing the performance and reliability of display systems in both consumer and automotive applications\nWe visited the VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) demo suite at CES 2024 for a tour of VESA\u2019s latest demos and to meet with VESA executives. They told us about the latest VESA display standards, including the new Automotive Extension Specification protocol, and the latest updates to the Adaptive-Sync Display standard, which we wrote about here.\nVESA showed us how the latest update to DisplayPort, version 2.1a, which replaces the VESA-certified DP40 Ultra-High bit rate (UHBR) cable specification with a new VESA-certified DP54 UHBR cable spec, can enable up to four-lane UHBR13.5 link-rate support (a maximum throughput of 54 Gbps) over a 2-meter passive cable, which supports three new data rates per lane: 10 Gbps, 13.5 Gbps, and 20 Gbps. The maximum total bandwidth on a standard four-lane connection is 4\u00d7 20 Gbps, or 80 Gbps, which is important for 8K displays. Previous specifications limited cable length to 1 meter, so this update doubles the passive cable length for UHBR13.5 GPU-to-display connections.\nDoes this matter? The very real example of trying to cable a trade show was right in front of us. An extra meter makes all the difference in a lot of settings.\nVESA also used CES to announce a new Automotive Extension Services protocol specification for both DisplayPort 2.1a and the latest version of VESA\u2019s Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) specification, version 1.5a.\nThis protocol extension provides support for automotive display functional safety as well as secure integrity and authentication for up to 16 display regions of interest.

Sink and source devices supporting UHBR20 link rates (a maximum throughput of 80 Gbps using all four lanes) continue to be supported by VESA certified DP80 UHBR cables.\n\u201cWith the latest update to DisplayPort, the UHBR13.5 cable spec is now purpose built to provide both UHBR10 and UHBR13.5 monitors and graphics cards with a longer passive cable. Consumers are no longer limited to connecting UHBR13.5 sink and source devices with a one-meter DP80 cable, which provides more bandwidth support than what their hardware needs and, in some cases, might be too short for their set-up, for example with ultra-wide curved displays,\u201d stated James Choate, compliance program manager for VESA.\nMaking the De Facto Standard for Vehicle Displays Even Better\nAs vehicles become more advanced and connected, the number of high-resolution interior displays in automobiles is on the rise. These displays provide a wide variety of critical information that drivers need to operate their vehicles safely and efficiently. Most automotive displays currently use DisplayPort or eDP to carry video data from the central vehicle computer to the displays. In addition to its high video bandwidth capability, DisplayPort features Multi-Stream Transport (MST), which enables multiple displays to be connected to a single DP source port. However, until now, there was no standardized way to verify that the data transmitted from the GPU was received by the display in the same way that it was sent, ensuring it is free of noise injection or errors.\nVESA\u2019s new Automotive Extension specification protocol addresses this need, adding critical safety and security protocols on top of the existing DisplayPort 2.1a and eDP 1.5a spec. It features a mandatory functional safety profile for the main data path and metadata that uses very-high-safety-rated cyclical redundancy check (CRC) polynomial mathematical signatures for every frame of video data across the data path. This ensures that a frame never gets dropped or repeated so that critical events are always captured and never missed.\nThe protocol also features more advanced optional profiles that provide functional safety for the DisplayPort Aux channel, which carries command and control data for the video source device; security authentication and integrity checking on the data path, to prevent unauthorized tampering with the video data or the physical displays themselves; and encryption of the DisplayPort Aux channel, to prevent hackers from reading information on the types of displays in the vehicles that could be used to tamper with the displays.\n\u201cDisplays are increasingly being integrated into automobiles, which provides a valuable infotainment resource for drivers and passengers but can also create opportunities for safety errors and data breaches if not properly secured,\u201d stated Bill Lempesis, executive director of VESA. \u201cAs the world\u2019s leading standards body for the global display industry, VESA takes automotive display safety and security seriously. Leveraging the latest versions of DisplayPort and eDP with VESA\u2019s Display Stream Compression (DSC) codec, our new Automotive Extension Services protocol can handle the safety and security needs of virtually every safety-critical display in the vehicle from a single cable. We are issuing a call to electronics, displays and automotive manufacturers to join our efforts in continuing to shape this new Automotive Extension Services protocol to address the future challenges and needs facing the automotive industry and consumers.\u201d\nThe VESA Automotive Extension Working Group, which is driving the new Automotive Extension specification protocol, is open to all VESA members.

VESA has been working closely with member companies to ensure that products supporting DisplayPort 2.0 would actually meet the newer, more demanding DisplayPort 2.1 spec. Due to this effort, all previously certified DisplayPort 2.0 products including UHBR (Ultra-high Bit Rate) capable products \u2013 whether GPUs, docking station chips, monitor scalar chips, PHY repeater chips such as re-timers, or DP40/DP80 cables (including both passive and active, and using full-size DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort or USB Type-C connectors) \u2013 have already been certified to the stricter DisplayPort 2.1 spec.\nAchieving a robust, end-to-end user visual experience remains the utmost priority for VESA\u2019s DisplayPort specification, whether across a native DisplayPort cable, via DisplayPort Alt Mode (DisplayPort over the USB Type-C connector), or tunneled through the USB4 link. As such, DisplayPort 2.1 has tightened its alignment with the USB Type-C specification as well as the USB4 PHY specification to facilitate a common PHY servicing both DisplayPort and USB4. In addition, DisplayPort 2.1 has added a new DisplayPort bandwidth management feature to enable DisplayPort tunneling to coexist with other I/O data traffic more efficiently over the USB4 link. This increased efficiency is on top of mandated support for VESA\u2019s visually lossless Display Stream Compression (DSC) codec and VESA\u2019s Panel Replay capability. DSC bitstream support can reduce DisplayPort transport bandwidth in excess of 67 percent without visual artifacts, while VESA\u2019s Panel Replay capability can reduce DisplayPort tunneling packet transport bandwidth in excess of 99 percent when Panel Replay operation is taking place.\n\u201cAchieving greater alignment between DisplayPort and USB on a common PHY has been a particularly important effort within VESA given the significant overlap in use case models between the DisplayPort and USB4 ecosystems,\u201d stated Alan Kobayashi, VESA Board Chair and VESA DisplayPort Task Group Chair. \u201cDisplayPort 2.1 brings DisplayPort into convergence with USB4 PHY specifications to ensure the highest video performance across a broad range of consumer products. Display transport through DisplayPort, with its higher bit rates and proven visual quality of DSC compression even for HDR content, offers ample bandwidth for the needs of virtually every practical application. Features such as driving multiple displays over a single cable, or enabling multiple functions on a single port like video, power and data transfer, no longer require any compromise in video format choice. The advanced capabilities of the DisplayPort video interface are enabled by the invaluable contributions by our more than 300 member companies from across the electronics ecosystem.\u201d\nDisplayPort 2.1 has also updated the DisplayPort cable specification to provide greater robustness and enhancements to full-size and Mini DisplayPort cable configurations that enable improved connectivity and longer cable lengths (beyond two meters for DP40 cables and beyond one meter for DP80 cables) without diminishing UHBR performance. VESA certified DP40 cables support up to the UHBR10 link rate (10 Gbps), with four lanes, providing a maximum throughput of 40 Gbps, while VESA certified DP80 cables support up to the UHBR20 link rate (20 Gbps), with four lanes, providing a maximum throughput of 80 Gbps.\n\u201cFor all of our standards including DisplayPort, VESA has invested significant resources in testing and auditing procedures, including interoperability testing of products incorporating VESA specifications. This is to ensure that products that are introduced to market that claim support of VESA\u2019s standards meet the high-quality benchmarks that we have established,\u201d stated James Choate, compliance program manager for VESA. \u201cVESA continues to investigate and develop new procedures to improve our auditing process in order to ensure robust implementation of quality products supporting DisplayPort and other VESA specs in the market. Thanks to the contributions by test equipment vendors, VESA has a solid test infrastructure in place to support wider testing and deployment of DisplayPort 2.1 certified devices in the marketplace.\u201d\nAbout VESA\nThe Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) is an international, non-profit standards association representing a global network of more than 300 hardware, software, computer, display and component manufacturers committed to developing and promoting the electronics industry.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nVESA introduces DisplayPort 2.1a standard, providing higher resolution and refresh rate combos and doubling cable length limit\nVESA's DisplayPort 2.1a is shaping up to be a future-ready standard for distant future PC users\nThe Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) has just announced a new DisplayPort 2.1a standard which supports multi-resolution combinations and doubles its passive cable length from 1 to 2 meters.\nThe new DP54 ultra-high bitrate (UHBR) cable introduces the UHBR13 specification and succeeds the DP40 specification which uses the UHBR10 standard. The new standard will be taken advantage of by different electronics, but will mainly be beneficial for ultra-widescreen and multi-display setups.\nThe newer DP 2.1a cable allows a four-lane UHBR13.5 link rate to provide a data throughput of up to 54 Gbps over a two-meter cable. This is a breakthrough since the UHBR13.5 specification was only possible with a DP80 UHBR cable which is restricted to 1 meter cables.\nThis change in cable length and bandwidth increase is much appreciated and just in time for newer generation monitors, televisions, graphic cards and different types of sink (usually the display) & source devices for different uses.\nCable Length Compatible with DP2.0 Standard\nUsers with UHBR13.5-supported hardware and cables allow higher resolution and refresh rate combinations up to 8K2K at 240 Hz or 8K4K at 120 Hz. The DP2.1a's two-meter cable length can be taken advantage of by the current-gen UHBR10 specification that's available on the DisplayPort 2.0 standard.\nJames Choate, the compliance program manager for VESA said a press release that \"with the latest update to DisplayPort, the UHBR13.5 cable spec is now purpose-built to provide both UHBR10 and UHBR13.5 monitors and graphics cards with a longer passive cable. Consumers are no longer limited to connecting UHBR13.5 sink and source devices with a one-meter DP80 cable, which provides more bandwidth support than what their hardware needs and, in some cases, might be too short for their set-up, for example with ultra-wide curved displays.\"\nDon't expect to see many devices take advantage of the new cables anytime soon. The recently-announced RTX 40 Super series graphics cards use DisplayPort1.4a output. The same can be said of the monitors announced during CES 2024. Sink and Source devices will take a long time to adopt DisplayPort 2.1a.\nVESA is ready for the distant future, but we'll only get to see this new standard widely adopted with graphic cards beyond RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, which will use DisplayPort 2.0. Since DP 2.0 devices can take advantage of the added cable length, we might see this cable standard deployed during the RTX 50's lifecycle and for near-future high-resolution TVs.\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

        "raw_content": "VESA Updates Adaptive-Sync Display Spec to 1.1a, Adds Dual-Mode and Overclocked Gaming Monitors\nAhead of next week\u2019s CES 2024 trade show, this morning VESA is releasing an update to their Adaptive-Sync Display variable refresh certification standard to accommodate some forthcoming \u201cdual-mode\u201d gaming displays. Under the new Adaptive-Sync Display 1.1a standard, display manufacturers will now be able to certify displays that have multiple resolution-dependent maximum refresh rates \u2013 chiefly, those displays offering high refresh rates at high-DPI resolutions such as 4K, and even higher refresh rates at 1080p and the like. The 1.1a version of the standard is also being updated to support displays with overclocked modes, allowing display manufacturers to get those modes separately certified on top of their default modes.\nDisplays offering higher maximum refresh rates at lower resolutions are not strictly a new innovation in the space, but PC enthusiasts are likely to be more familiar with the concept with 4K TVs. Constrained by the available cable bandwidth of the time, HDMI 2.0-era sets such as LG\u2019s C8 OLEDs could offer either 60Hz support at 4K, or 120Hz support at 1080p. And while the concept has fallen by the wayside a bit since the arrival of HDMI 2.1, it has not gone away entirely. Now, as we go into 2024, VESA and its display manufacturing members are preparing to launch a new generation of PC gaming displays that employ the dual-mode concept to allow for even higher refresh rates at lower resolutions.\nTo that end, the Adaptive-Sync Display standard is being updated to include certification testing criteria and branding to explicitly support and promote these dual-mode displays. According to VESA, the testing criteria itself hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 in fact, for existing 1.1-certified monitors, everything is identical \u2013 but rather the specification is laying out how manufacturers can get both modes certified. In other words, manufacturers will be able to get their wares validated as meeting the Adaptive-Sync Display standard\u2019s variable refresh performance requirements in both high-resolution and high-refresh modes.\nTo go with this new certification program, the Adaptive-Sync Display logo program has also been updated to reflect these results. Certified dual-mode displays will list both modes they\u2019re certified for, with the logo to include the refresh rate and the resolution.\nTop: Classic/Single-Mode Logo. Bottom: New Dual-Mode Logo\nIn VESA\u2019s example, their fictitious product is a 4K display that offers a 144Hz maximum refresh rate at 4K, and 280Hz at 1080p. For vendors that do choose to seek dual-mode certification, VESA is requiring that the high-resolution mode support a maximum refresh rate of at least 144Hz, while the high-refresh mode\u2019s resolution not be any lower than 1080. The net result is that the new dual-mode specification is primarily geared towards 4K monitors since it\u2019s a multiple of 1080p, but it\u2019s not exclusively baked into the spec. Otherwise, displays will need to support all of the feature requirements of Adaptive-Sync Display, including flicker-free operation and fast G2G transition times.\nMeanwhile, reading between the lines on VESA\u2019s press release ahead of CES, it would appear that the addition of dual-mode certification to the Adaptive-Sync Display standard \u2013 and indeed the creation of the displays themselves \u2013 is being driven by the same bottleneck that lead to dual-mode TVs in the last decade: display cable and processor bandwidth limitations. While DisplayPort 2.1 is already the fastest display cable standard around, with UHBR 20 mode offering almost 80Gbps of bandwidth, few source devices offer that much bandwidth. AMD restricts UHBR 20 mode support to its Radeon Pro cards, and NVIDIA\u2019s current-generation Ada Lovelace (RTX 40 series) hardware doesn\u2019t support DisplayPort 2.x at all. So while forthcoming 4K displays can refresh at upwards of 480Hz, the bandwidth to do so at 4K isn\u2019t consistently there.\nThe end result is that, depending on whether you\u2019re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person, high-end gaming displays are either being given the opportunity to increase their refresh rates at low resolutions, or they\u2019re having to cap their refresh rates at high resolutions. Either way, without the bandwidth necessary to drive 4K at 480Hz and similarly high resolutions, display vendors are needing to separate maximum refresh rates by resolution to accommodate what contemporary hardware can actually provide.\nASUS's Forthcoming ROG Swift PG32UCDP\nMeanwhile, although the VESA consortium itself doesn\u2019t announce any products, but both LG and ASUS have been teasing dual-mode gaming displays in the last couple of months, which in turn we\u2019re expecting to see in greater detail at CES. LG has the forthcoming LG 32GS95UE, which is pictured at the top of this article and offers a 32-inch 4K WOLED display with maximum refresh rates of 4K@240Hz and 1080p@480Hz. ASUS, in turn, will be using that panel for their ROG Swift PG32UCDP, offering the same 4K@240Hz and 1080p@480Hz modes. We\u2019ll likely see more displays from more manufacturers in due time, but given the popularity of their OLED displays, LG alone is enough to move the gaming market.\nMoving on, the Adaptive-Sync Display 1.1a specification is also adding support for what the group classifies as \u201coverclocked\u201d displays \u2013 that is, monitors offering a faster mode that is not enabled by default in the out-of-the-box factory configuration. Under the updated spec, OEMs who offer monitors with overclocking modes will be allowed to pursue a higher Adaptive-Sync Display certification level (i.e. a higher logo\u2019d refresh rate), so long as they can pass the standard\u2019s requirements in both factory and overclocked modes. Notably, the VESA is also requiring that overclocked displays \u201cmust support Adaptive-Sync-enabled GPUs in a non-proprietary manner\u201d, which seems intended to shortcut any G-Sync-exclusive shenanigans.\nAt this time we aren\u2019t immediately aware of any forthcoming monitors that would rely on the new overlcocking rules. But given the market-driven nature of VESA\u2019s standards, we\u2019d assume such displays are right around the corner, just like dual-mode gaming displays.\nRegardless, expect to hear more from the CES show floor next week as manufacturers begin talking about their next generation of gaming displays.\nSource:\nVESA\nPost Your Comment\n9 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?
