We won the \"CES 2024 Innovation Awards,\" which are given to particularly highly acclaimed products. In commemoration of the award, we will extend the existing limited-time campaign and start a more advantageous campaign.\nCampaign overview\nWe will start a campaign to support the installation of \"iwasemi\u2122 RC-\u03b1\" and \"iwasemi\u2122 SQ-\u03b1\" on January 17, 2024. In this campaign, if you install more than 3 meeting rooms, half of the number of installations will be free.\nPeriod: Wednesday, January 17, 2024 until the end of March*\nContents: For customers who install \"iwasemi\u2122 RC-\u03b1\" and \"iwasemi\u2122 SQ-\u03b1\" for more than 3 meeting rooms, we will charge half of the number of installed tickets for free.\n* The implementation period will be limited to projects whose installation will be completed by the end of March 2024.\n* We will calculate the optimal number and estimated amount according to the size of the conference room.\nThe campaign will only be applied to customers who agree to our quotation.\n* Layout design and installation costs will be discussed separately.\n* We will calculate the optimal number and estimated amount according to the size of the conference room.\n\"iwasemi\u2122 RC-\u03b1\" series installation support campaign usage example and voice of installing companies\nCase 1\uff1a\nToyota Connected Corporation\nComments\uff1a\nUntil now, there was no sound-absorbing panel that could be attached to glass, so I was worried about countermeasures.\niwasemi RC-\u03b1 can be attached to glass and the unit is small and the design can be freely assembled.\nWe were able to take measures against the sound of the glass-walled conference room without destroying the design of the office space.\nAfter installation, you no longer have to worry about the reverberation in the conference room, making it easier to hold face-to-face meetings as well as web conferences.\nCase 2\uff1a\nTokyo Midtown Yaesu\nComments\uff1a\nWe installed iwasemi in a private room meeting room in the innovation co-creation space (business lounge).\nSince it is not a space used only by specific companies, it is important that the voice in the conference room does not leak outside.\nThanks to its high sound absorption performance, smooth communication is created under a wonderful acoustic environment.\nIn addition, the design is high, and the texture of the space has improved.\nAbout iwasemi\u2122\niwasemi\u2122 is a sound absorbing material developed by applying PxDT's unique sound absorbing design technology to acoustic metamaterial technology. iwasemi\u2122 sound absorbing material has the following three characteristics.\n1. Flexibility of sound absorption frequency characteristics\nIn principle, general sound absorbing materials such as glass wool have the property that the sound absorption rate increases as the band goes to a high band. On the other hand, iwasemi\u2122 can achieve flexible sound absorption frequency characteristics according to the application scene, such as the property that the sound absorption rate increases only in a specific frequency band and the property that the sound absorption rate is uniformly high from low band to high band.\n2. High sound absorption and thinning\nIn order to increase the sound absorption rate with general sound absorbing materials, it is necessary to thicken the sound absorbing material.\nOn the other hand, iwasemi\u2122 can increase the sound absorption rate without thickening the sound absorbing material. In other words, thinning can be achieved while maintaining the sound absorption coefficient equivalent to that of general sound absorbing materials.\n3. High degree of freedom in material selection and processing freedom\nCommon sound absorbing materials are porous structures such as glass or wool. Therefore, the design and strength are limited.\nOn the other hand, iwasemi\u2122 uses a resonance structure, so various materials (e.g. ABS (photo: left), stainless steel (photo: center), acrylic (photo: right)) can be used to achieve high sound absorption. As a result, it is possible to realize sound absorbing materials that take into consideration design such as color variations including transparent colors and texture expressions by surface treatment, and sound absorbing materials with high strength. In addition, since the sound absorbing material can be molded integrally with the applied product, it can contribute to improving the strength and weight of the applied product.\nRelated articles\uff1ahttps://pixiedusttech.com/technologies/iwasemi/\n\"iwasemi\u2122 RC-\u03b1\" blends into the space\n\"iwasemi\u2122 RC-\u03b1\" is a sound absorbing material that can be attached to glass. The transparent sound-absorbing panel is unparalleled in the world, and has been successfully developed with acoustic metamaterial technology and unique design technology.\nPlastic is used as the raw material, and by achieving high transparency that blends in with glass, the problem of sound in the workspace is efficiently solved while maintaining the sense of freedom and design of the glass. In addition, a sound-absorbing structure specialized for human voices suppresses the echo sound that haunts the glass space, and at the same time, various layout patterns can be created for tiles. The fluctuating shape on the surface of the main unit has a blindfold function, and can be used not only for sound absorption but also as a privacy measure for conference rooms. There is also the benefit of using plant-derived bioengineered plastics, which can contribute to reducing environmental impact.\nRelated article\uff1ahttps://pixiedusttech.com/product/iwasemi/rc-a/\n\"iwasemi\u2122 SQ-\u03b1\" for an eye-catching and sound-catching space\n\"iwasemi\u2122 SQ-\u03b1\" is a sound absorbing material that has acquired a new design expression that can be painted hard.\nAs with the iwasemiTM RC-\u03b1, we have applied acoustic metamaterial technology to achieve high design and sound absorption performance. In the case of \"I want to give a sense of dignity\" or \"I want to add an accent to the design\", the sound environment can be improved and the ideal office environment can be achieved in terms of design.\nRelated article\uff1ahttps://pixiedusttech.com/product/iwasemi/sq-a/\nAbout CES 2024\nCES, which has been held since 1967, was once an exhibition focusing on home appliances, but now it is held in Las Vegas, USA, every January as one of the world's largest technology events.\nMore than 3000 products were applied for the 2024 CES Innovation Awards, of which 522 were awarded.\nOfficial site\uff1ahttps://www.ces.tech/\nName\uff1aCES 2024\nDates\uff1aTuesday, January 9, 2024 - Friday, January 12, 2024 (US time)\nVenue\uff1aEureka Park Booth7, Venetian 1F, Las Vegas, USA\nWhat is acoustic metamaterial technology?\nMetamaterials are a general term for artificial substances that behave in ways that are not found in nature by imparting a fine periodic shape below the wavelength to a substance. By applying this concept to the field of sound waves, acoustic metamaterial technology is a technology that generates substances with acoustic characteristics that are not found in nature.\nReference: Acoustic Metamaterials Market Trends\nAcoustic metamaterial technology can be used in various fields such as air conditioning, building materials, equipment, railways, construction, automobiles, aviation / space, home appliances, and industrial equipment because it is possible to have arbitrary soundproofing performance with lightweight and thin materials. The market size of acoustic metamaterials in Japan in 2023 is expected to be about 1.7 billion yen.\nIn addition, the market size is expected to reach 56.1 billion yen in 2035, and it is expected to be adopted in the fields of architecture, automobiles, aerospace, and medical devices in the future.\n(Reference: Fuji Keizai Co., Ltd. \"Survey on the acoustic metamaterial market expected as a next-generation soundproofing material\")\nInquiries about this matter\nPixie Dust Technologies, Inc.
