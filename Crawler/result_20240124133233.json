We are unveiling the new E/E architecture for SDV and core SDV (software-defined vehicle) technologies created by 42dot, Hyundai Motor Group's Global Software Center, at our CES booth, marking a significant milestone in our ongoing journey to advancing software-defined vehicle technology.\nSDV Technologies Presented at CES 2024\n1. New E&E Architecture for SDV Demo\nWith the ever-expanding features integrated into modern mobility, cars today harbor intricate E/E (electrical and electronics) architectures. We recognize this complexity as an opportunity, and it\u2019s this challenge that\u2019s behind the software-defined vehicle (SDV) model we\u2019ve been working on for HMG\u2019s transition into a software company. Our SDV framework hinges on a hardware and software decoupled structure, a solution that simplifies the vehicle\u2019s architecture and empowers engineers to focus on software development. This strategic decoupling grants engineers the flexibility and agility to enhance vehicle system development while ensuring unparalleled user-centric experiences.\nTo achieve this decoupling in SDVs, we recognized the necessity to develop a universal hardware platform capable of abstracting and efficiently managing the vehicle's computing infrastructure and sensor/actuator configurations. That\u2019s where 42dot comes in; they are leading the development of the new E/E architecture for SDV.\nThis new technology takes center stage at our CES booth, showcasing its prowess in securely overseeing autonomous driving functionalities while efficiently managing the vehicle's computing, sensors, and actuators which ensure safe driving - even in the face of a hardware or network failure- underscoring our commitment to safety and user experience in SDV development.\n2. HPVC and SDV OS\nAt the crux of the new E/E architecture for SDV, there is the HPVC (high-performance vehicle computer), also known as the brain. At CES, we have unveiled two variations of HPVC \u2013 the air-cooled and water-cooled models. These HPVC units are the powerhouse of computation within the SDVs, integrating various functions while assuming the position of primary control. With the HPVC, Hyundai's SDVs can streamline hardware by consolidating multiple roles and features into a single unit, reducing the reliance on numerous hardware controllers or multiple domain controllers.\nThere are four main functions the HPVC integrates into the vehicle:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Autonomous driving stacks covering from Level 2 ADAS to Level 4 automated driving systems, to enhance the user\u2019s safe mobility experience.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0In-vehicle infotainment (IVI) for communication between the vehicle and the driver/passenger.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Data gateway interconnects HPVC and controllers via a high-speed Ethernet backbone network and handles (collecting, exchanging and storing) a large amount of data internally through high bandwidth and throughput communication.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Connectivity via RF communication to send and receive data outside the vehicle via LTE (5G), BT/WIFI, etc.\nThe SDV OS efficiently manages applications across the vehicle built with the new E/E architecture, and effectively runs applications on physically distributed hardware, ensuring reliability and efficiency. Additionally, through the unified vehicle API, it enables vehicles composed of physically distributed hardware to be virtually managed as a single product, maximizing software flexibility and optimizing resource utilization across the vehicle. 42dot\u2019s SDV OS is powered by Rust, to operate a mission-critical system that ensures safety.\n3. Data-Driven Learning Systems\nAutonomous driving technology is a key component of SDVs. To build a smart AI system, 42dot is transforming vehicles into learning machines with the goal of not only advancing AI engineering but also bringing AI & autonomous driving technology to the public. 42dot is continuously collecting, curating, and training data to validate AI models and improve camera-based autonomous driving technology. To optimize the process, they have integrated an agile development of two-week sprints of engineering, performing simulation, deploying into R&D fleets, and eventually deploying software into service fleets. 42dot automates the training, optimization, deployment, and integration process to enhance efficiency (CI/CD). The MLOps and DataOps methodology enables 42dot to create a framework for rapid improvements of AI in mobility.\n4. Safety-Designed Vehicle\nSafety is our utmost priority, hence 42dot is implementing safety in all aspects of SDV hardware and software such as strengthening the cybersecurity of SDVs, redundant vehicle network and enhancing safe driving practices.\n42dot is committed to developing a comprehensive, integrated SDV security solution that addresses cybersecurity concerns across multiple facets, encompassing the protection of personal information and the prevention of unauthorized data access.\nMoreover, safe driving can be enhanced with AI. The SDV's AI algorithms employ 3D camera vision to perceive its surroundings, anticipate the vehicle's trajectory based on driver input, and alert against potential collisions with obstacles. This data is sent to the cloud and shared with other vehicles.\n5. LLM for Advanced Mobility\nLarge language models (LLM) harness the power to learn intricate language structures and when implemented correctly, they have the potential to change the way we move. Now, most existing vehicle AI assistants provide responses in a single-turn method. However, LLM-based assistants offer seamless multi-turn conversations that mirror human interactions. Empowered with the language structures trained from vast amounts of data, 42dot\u2019s AI assistant, based on its own LLM, can generate proper human-like responses.\n42dot\u2019s own AI assistant will be integrated into various in-vehicle infotainment apps and connected services such as AI assistant, AI navigation, autonomous driving, intelligent fleet safety & management - the possibilities are endless. The AI assistant can provide tailored recommendations based on one\u2019s habits and lifestyle. It can also generate necessary human readable/listenable alerts which improves the efficiency of fleet management.\n6. Self-Managed Smart City\nSDV technologies can extend to fleets and into cities to optimize businesses and cities\u2019 transportation infrastructure. 42dot provides safe, user-centric autonomous technology and mobility algorithms to provide optimized routing based on real-time data. Road data managed via the cloud is shared with all SDV equipped vehicles to provide optimal mobility services.\nAll mobility information such as vehicle, driver, trip data, and real-time traffic information is digitized and managed via a centralized FMS (fleet management system). Vehicle collisions and accidents are handled with AI-driven accident alerts and reporting systems. The 42dot system automatically notifies relevant parties and creates documentation for operation needs. All driver, vehicle and traffic data including video clips are tamper-resistant, managed and protected with blockchain technology.\nThese technologies not only enable us to manage fleets but also efficiently manage the movement of cities through \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d.\n7. Software-Defined Mobility in Motion\nHyundai Motor Group advances SDV and mobility technologies to provide customer-oriented mobility experiences.\nHMC\u2019s Shucle, a DRT (demand response transport) shuttle service based on AI dynamic routing, dynamically monitors community operations and traffic flow in real-time, providing the most efficient routes for all the passengers in the shuttle.\n42dot\u2019s \u2018TAP!\u2019, the official autonomous mobility platform of Seoul, is leading the commercialization of autonomous mobility. The platform accommodates multiple autonomous vehicles from different providers, including 42dot, in seven different service locations. Users can dispatch different routes and autonomous vehicles such as autonomous taxis and shuttles.\nMotional\u2019s \u2018Robotaxi\u2019, the IONIQ-based level 4 self-driving taxi service to come soon in Las Vegas, is on the cusp of transforming into a fully driverless operation. Robotaxi will leverage cutting-edge technology - such as state-of-the-art 3D detection technology integrating cameras and lidar - that captures and interprets real-time surroundings to provide advanced autonomous driving.\nAre you ready to explore the ground-breaking innovations Hyundai unveiled at CES 2024?\nFollow @hyundai on instagram to join us on our journey to bringing 'Progress for Humanity'.\nShare\nKeyword\nVEHICLES\nIONIQ 5\nREAD MORE\nRead More Articles\nFuture mobility services\nCES 2024: Hyundai transitions to hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation to ease every way\nFuture mobility services\nIONIQ 5-based Robotaxi \u2013 the safe bet for getting around Las Vegas\nfooter menus\n\u24d2 2024 Hyundai Motor Company\nCLOSE"

This means that there will be greater equality in the access to, and use of, energy. Just imagine a world where everyday waste is made into clean energy making our living spaces safe, clean, and free from pollution.\nWe are working on software that is optimized for users and guarantees free movement by connecting mobility options and the city in one place. Based on the data that is accumulated, our software can then proactively protect everyone even in dangerous situations.\nHyundai is making this world a reality with our hydrogen energy and software solutions.\nOur passion for hydrogen energy\nHydrogen energy is not a new thing for us. We have always held the belief that hydrogen energy is essential for the future. In fact, here at Hyundai, we have been developing hydrogen vehicles since 1998. That\u2019s 26 years of expertise already.\nIn 2013, we commercialized the world's first mass-produced Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the Tucson iX35 FCEV. We followed this with the launch of the NEXO in 2018 and achieved the top spot worldwide for sales of hydrogen vehicles.\nWith the launch of our hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck XCIENT Fuel Cell in 2020, we have further verified the excellent quality of our hydrogen mobility. Since 2020, our XCIENT Fuel Cell heavy-duty trucks in Switzerland has accumulated 8.7 million kilometers of cumulative driving in real-life customer operation.\nOur preparation for the future, which began with the development of hydrogen vehicles, has now expanded across our entire company. Our next goal is to provide comprehensive hydrogen-related solutions across the entire hydrogen value chain.\nWhat\u2019s more, to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society, we need to start using hydrogen on a larger scale. To this end, we will increase our hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes per year by 2035 and use this to propel a major transformation.\nThe HTWO Grid, end-to-end hydrogen solution\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to a hydrogen energy ecosystem requires a comprehensive solution that is tailored to the different needs of everyone who needs to use it.\nOur answer is HTWO Grid, an end-to-end hydrogen solution where the capabilities of every affiliate intersect at all stages of hydrogen production from storage and transportation to utilization. This will even offer customized solutions optimized for various environments and physical characteristics through its organic combinations and connections between each technology.\nWe already have different hydrogen solution packages in the United States and are under discussion with Indonesia on a waste-to-hydrogen production focused solution package. Especially, the Clean Logistics Project that will officially launch in the second half of 2024 is expected to drive a hydrogen society in Georgia. We plan to provide our solution to different regions, thus accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society in the future.\nTurning everyday waste into energy\nThe best-known method of producing clean hydrogen is water electrolysis, which produces hydrogen by splitting water. However, the availability of water is different from region to region. So, we became interested in ways to turn waste generated in everyday life into hydrogen.\nWaste-to-energy technology, which we introduced at CES 2024, is a technology that converts sewage, food waste, livestock manure, and plastic waste that is concerned as a headache to all countries.\nWaste-to-energy technology is largely divided into two types. Firstly, waste-to-hydrogen technology is a method that decomposes organic waste with microorganisms to generate biogas and convert this into hydrogen. Secondly, plastic-to-hydrogen technology is a method of obtaining hydrogen by gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements. Hyundai Motor Group is already in action to produce hydrogen from biogas in Chungju city in Korea.\nBoth technologies have a double positive effect (win-win) as they fix two problems: they can obtain clean hydrogen energy while reducing the waste around us.\nProviding freedom to move through software and AI\nBeyond vehicles, we are also expanding into SDx which means \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d. This means redefining vehicles, fleets, transportation system and beyond, with software and AI.\nWe aspire to create a user-centred, safer, and more convenient mobility ecosystem through software and AI, because they allow everything to be connected without the constraints of time and space.\nThe first thing we\u2019ve been working on is a shift in development. When a \u201csoftware-defined\u201d approach is applied to automobiles, all features can be designed and updated based on user\u2019s mobility journey.\nSoftware can quickly improve the vehicle's user experience and safety features, driving performance, and app services. It can even define a vehicle\u2019s entire identity.\nSo through software and AI, we want to connect mobility, logistics solutions with devices and city operations systems, and transform the way the world moves. Hyundai see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation.\nThe whole SDx journey is driven by the values of convenience and safety, which have always been a priority for Hyundai Motor Group. Using software to fulfill our \u201cService-defined, Safety-designed\u201d philosophy will help us strengthen and evolve these values even more.\nDreaming of a new mobility ecosystem with our vision for SDx\nOur vision for SDx begins with SDV (software-defined vehicle). For this, we plan to incorporate software development practice into vehicle development, allowing independent updates and advancement of software and hardware. This increases agility and scalability of vehicle development, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nWith the spread of SDVs in the market, data and platforms will be increasingly connected therefore management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Hyundai will expand its software solutions to business customers and provide insights, by enabling optimal operation and management of vehicles, and real-time data analytics to issues for fleet operators.\nAs vehicles and fleets get defined and developed by software, they will eventually become AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers. Through automated and autonomous development, improvement and updates of devices and solutions, mobility in general will become efficient and accessible, adding value for users.\nHyundai is dreaming where HMG's various software technologies and platforms are combined to lay the foundation for a \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019, where an entire self-operating urban transportation system is connected and run through software and AI.\nUsers will be provided with transportation-as-a-service, all any mobility and logistics solutions needed in time. With all software-defined HMG devices, from vehicles to AAM, robotics to smart factories, all connected within the mobility ecosystem seamlessly.\nOpening up infinite possibilities with Hyundai\u2019s future mobility\nAt CES 2024, we introduced our future mobility concept with roots in hydrogen, software fused with robotics technology to ease our lives in every way. We are expanding \u201cmovement\u201d beyond limitations, here are some of the things you can look forward to seeing from us in the future.\nDICE (Digital Curated Experience)\nSoftware combined with AI technology offers a whole new mobility experience. For example, DICE is a personal mobility concept that delivers a personalized curated experience, which makes the time spent moving more valuable.\nDICE linked with AI recognizes you anytime, anywhere, and provides optimized services. It can also be connected with a personal device to create a customized environment. DICE\u2019s three-sided Transparent OLED create immersive personalized experiences. The ring pad controller, a kinetic interface that is an evolved form of the \u2018fixed interface\u2019 dashboard of existing vehicles, allows you to communicate with AI and adjust the environment of DICE. DICE can process individual preferences and movement environments to deliver a continuous curation of optimized content even while you\u2019re enroute.\nSPACE (Spatial Curated Experience)\nThe development of software technology has opened a wide spectrum of possibilities for space within mobility. SPACE, social mobility concept, is based on inclusivity and circularity. It embraces diverse needs with inclusive and social value, providing free movement and customized spatial experiences for all.\nSPACE \u2013 Mobility: This multi-seater public mobility system gives everyone, including people with mobility impairments, unrestricted access to travel experiences. The interior space is reinterpreted as a personalized space supported by autonomous driving, AI and \u2018Adaptive Seat\u2019 stored within the walls. Boarding height control allows easy boarding of wheelchairs and provides the perfect solution for last mile mobility for you, your pets and any other guests.\nSPACE \u2013 Pavilion: Obsolete SPACE modules are reinterpreted as architectural elements and reassembled into the shape of a pavilion, offering inclusive usability even to disadvantaged areas. It features a Hologram Interface for communicating with the software environment. The hydrogen energy system supports portable battery slots and various charging modules, providing smart farms and air-cleaning algae modules using water by-products. The seats provide a space to rest. SPACE-Pavilion is a physical hub connecting people with the city, robots, and mobility.\nCITY POD\nWe also offer future logistics that grant mobility solutions that go beyond the limits of the current logistics system and move freely and organically at every stage. CITY POD is capable of a digital twin control that was systematically organized both above and below ground utilizing AI. It also offers logistics within the city, leveraging future technologies such as Crab walk and autonomous driving to maximize efficiency. It provides a diverse range of uses not only in logistics but also in future life and industrial sites, including public transportation, industrial material and waste transportation, hydrogen energy transportation, and automatic refueling support.\nStretch\nStretch is our versatile, autonomous robot for safer and more efficient warehouse operations. Today, Stretch is out in the real world, unloading floor-loaded trailers and shipping containers on behalf of humans. In the next few years, Stretch will become a multi-purpose case-handling robot that will enable the lights-out warehouse of the future. Soon after, Stretch may be able to handle a variety of manipulation tasks, even outside of the warehouse. These robots are exceptional, intelligent machines that enrich people\u2019s lives by protecting humans from dangerous, repetitive, and physically challenging activities.\nThe dawn of a new world\nAlthough both hydrogen energy and software are invisible, they are like the air that exists all around us. Here at Hyundai, we are bringing positive changes to the world by combining the capabilities of our companies and realizing the full potential of hydrogen and software.\nThis new pathway will make all our lives more comfortable, and it will make our world cleaner and safer.

Clean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\nPresident and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company\nWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity. Our theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\nPresident and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company.\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO \u00a0from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business. \u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors. Having seen the real-world applications already being delivered by Hyundai, we\u2019re excited that Georgia is part of Hyundai\u2019s future.\u201d\nSDx: Building a user-centered mobility ecosystem by defining vehicles, fleets and\ntransportation systems with software and AI\nHyundai is undergoing a software-driven transformation led by the entire Group. As a provider of smart mobility solutions, Hyundai recognizes the importance of software and AI in creating a user-centric mobility ecosystem. At CES, the company announced its \u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019 (SDx) strategy, which aims to transform all moving devices, fleets and ecosystems into valuable assets through advanced software and AI.\nThrough its SDx strategy, the Group seeks to develop a mobility ecosystem that meets the needs of users anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, the Group is transitioning everything into a software-defined approach, from vehicle development to building the entire mobility ecosystem. It believes software and AI are enablers of achieving this vision through providing holistic user experience without limitations and is dedicated to delivering mobility services and solutions that prioritize convenience and safety.\nThe Group\u2019s strategy begins with developing \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV). This means to incorporate software development methods to automotive development which means to decouple hardware and software to enable independent updates and advancement of each. The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "Hyundai outlines its hydrogen, software plans at CES 2024\nEmphasis on 'outline'\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Hyundai kicked off its time at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show with a rather broad outline of both its hydrogen development activities and plans for software implementation in its vehicles. They range from fairly vague information to more specific, and everything from vehicle-specific to energy generation.\nHydrogen\nHyundai went most in-depth with its hydrogen work, and it certainly seems dedicated to making the fuel a major part of the renewable energy mix. It will be lumping basically every aspect of its hydrogen work including \"production, storage, transportation, and utilization\" under its HTWO brand (get it?). And among those categories, Hyundai will be working hard on the first few parts of that. It's working on getting more companies involved with off-take deals (agreements to purchase hydrogen) to build up the demand-side of the market. Hyundai itself is aiming for using hydrogen in both powering steel production facilities and general electricity production.\nIt's also developing PEM electrolyzers (Hyundai refers to it as \"polymer-electrolyte membrane,\" though it's also referred to as \"proton-exchange membrane\") for hydrogen production at \"megawatt-scale.\" These types of electrolyzers, as opposed to more common alkaline electrolyzers, have advantages in being more compact with longer-lasting electrolytes, rapid start-up and highly pure hydrogen production.\nFurthermore on the production side, Hyundai's HTWO is working on other methods for producing hydrogen from various waste. Some of that includes using biogas from organic wastes such as manure and food, and some of it comes from waste plastics by melting down and gasifying plastics to extract various elements from, leaving hydrogen gas.\nThen on the utilization front, Hyundai will continue its implementation of commercial trucks and related infrastructure. It has already been operating XCIENT fuel cell trucks to the Port of Oakland, and later, it will also use similar trucks at the large EV factory its building in Georgia.\nSoftware\nFar more vague were Hyundai's comments about its software plans. It referred to its desire to have software-defined everything, or \"SDx.\" Of course a big aspect of this is with \"SDV\" or software-defined vehicles. And what this means is Hyundai will be working on creating its own app market, making development kits available for people and companies to develop apps for Hyundai vehicles. Why should Apple and Google have all the app (and data and monetization) fun to themselves?\nHyundai also plans to further implement large-language model AI in its voice assistant and navigation technology. Plus, it plans to offer more information tools for fleet operators. Some of this development will play into Hyundai's goals of providing autonomous vehicles and different ways to access vehicles.\nRelated Video:\nHyundai\nInformation\nPopular Now\nHertz's Tesla liquidation sale likely means more depreciation for used EVs\nPorsche Macan EV previewed in official sketches, days ahead of its reveal\nEngineering Explained figures the towing Cybertruck didn't out-drag a 911\n2024 Acura ZDX price starts at $64,500 before destination, incentives\nHyundai Palisade spy photos show Ioniq-inspired styling\n2025 Buick Enclave teased with Wildcat EV styling language\nFollow Us\nResearch\nPopular Vehicles\nPopular New Vehicles\nPopular Used Vehicles\nPopular Electric Vehicles\nPopular Truck Vehicles\nPopular Crossover Vehicles\nPopular Luxury Vehicles\nPopular Hybrid Vehicles\nPopular Makes\nFeatured Makes\nProduct Guides\nChoose a Display Name\nPlease enter a display name\nSign in to post\nPlease sign in to leave a comment."

        "raw_content": "Select Page\nHyundai Mobis to showcase display and charging tech at CES 2024\nPosted by Gary Mason | Dec 20, 2023 | Electrification, Interiors, News, User Experience\nAt the CES 2024 show in Las Vegas next month, Hyundai Mobis is planning to present 20 new mobility technologies that it says are ready for immediate mass production. The supplier says it is aiming to diversify its client base and expand global orders through aggressive marketing, highlighting the company\u2019s technological capabilities and product quality.\nAmong the products that will be showcased to potential clients in areas such as electrification, lighting, and AAM (advanced air mobility) will be future mobility core technologies such as the Innovative Display series, which the company says is \u201crich\u201d in high-value advanced technology, and a high-power ICCU (integrated charging control unit).\nThe Innovative Display series is a collection of new products for automobiles that features the world\u2019s first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, a quantum dot and local dimming display, and a 3D display that features OLED-level performance in an LCD.\nRevealed last month, the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d QL display combines quantum dot technology, which enhances color reproduction for a more realistic depiction of original colors, with local dimming technology, which increases the contrast between light and dark colors for more precise image quality. The display maximizes brightness and clarity while offering the flexibility of slimmer thickness.\nWhile the currently popular OLED displays offer high performance, their high cost limits widespread application, according to the supplier. In contrast, the QL is a next-generation premium product considered on par with OLED in terms of performance but with more competitive pricing.\nHyundai Mobis says that the global vehicle display market is trending toward luxury with integrated large-screen structures extending from the driver to the passenger side. Technology such as the QL display, which enables high definition and slim design, is essential for mass production.\nThe supplier is actively seeking new order opportunities in the premium vehicle display sector leveraging the QL. With enhanced color reproduction and contrast ratio to OLED levels, the QL prototype features a large, 27-in, curved screen and a 14.5-mm design that can be slimmed down to about 10 mm by customer request.\nThe supplier will also present a transparent display for automobiles for the first time, the product a next-generation display that employs holographic optical element technology. The company says its new display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a \u201cwider sense of space and openness\u201d than that of general displays.\nAnother focal point of the Hyundai Mobis exhibit will be a new high-power ICCU, a key element for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The 22-kW-class power conversion system integrates elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. It is closely related to vehicle-to-grid technology, enabling an electric car battery to be used as a large power source for external uses.\nThe higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If a 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an EV with the same specifications as an 11-kW version, the vehicle\u2019s charging time is reduced by half, according to the company.\nThe new ICCU has received the green light for mass production.\nKevin Jost contributed to this article.\nRelated\nJoin the movement\nBecome a part of the Futurride.com community to receive updates from our team, our weekly enewsletters, and full access to our content.\nYou have successfully joined!\nShare:\nAbout The Author\nGary Mason, a Futurride contributor, is a storyteller and communications professional with more than 10 years of experience in the automotive industry.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation. The company is committed to providing optimized hydrogen mobility solutions, building on the foundation of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\nAlso on display, the mobile fuel cell generator supplies electricity solely through the fuel cell stack without the need for additional auxiliary power storage devices. It can be used in various fields and can provide power in emergencies, such as power outages, or challenging environments where accessing another power supply is difficult.\nThe mobile fuel cell generator is actively used in Electric Touring Car Racing (ETCR) competitions. To ensure the seamless operation of high-performance electric vehicles for all participating companies in the competition, Hyundai Motor has established a charging infrastructure using its hydrogen fuel cell system. The racing cars in the ETCR series recharge their batteries using electricity generated by the fuel cell generator produced by the Group.\nNext to the media table, a sectional model displays the operating principle of a portable hydrogen fuel cell generator, allowing a detailed examination of its structure for easy understanding.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram provides environmentally friendly public transportation, contributing to the purification and production of clean air. The hydrogen fuel cell tram is equipped with four hydrogen fuel cells with a capacity of 95 kW and can travel up to 150 km. It purifies approximately 800 \u03bcg of fine dust and produces 107.6 kg of clean air per hour of operation.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram is wireless, which does not require tram overhead lines, improving the aesthetics of the city and reducing infrastructure costs. Hyundai Rotem will continuously expand its lineup, including hydrogen high-speed trains, electric multiple units and locomotives.\nBooth visitors can also learn about how Hyundai Steel is preparing to establish a green steel production system to cut carbon emissions in the steel production process. It aims to reduce both direct and indirect carbon emissions by 12 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBy introducing eco-friendly processes that replace blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces and utilizing hydrogen and renewable energy instead of coal energy, the carbon emissions in the steel production process are significantly reduced.\nHyundai Motor is emphasizing its commitment to realizing the hydrogen vision at the Group level by showcasing a video inside the exhibition booth that explains the hydrogen demonstration projects and core technologies conducted by the group. This effort aims to highlight the company\u2019s ongoing dedication to making the hydrogen vision a reality.\nFostering a paradigm shift with the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019)\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai Motor showcases exhibits and videos introducing core \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) technologies under development by the Group\u2019s global software center, 42dot, emphasizing the importance of software (SW) and AI in becoming a smart mobility solutions provider.\nHyundai Motor aims to redefine everything from vehicles to all surrounding environments with SW and AI, promoting the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019). Its CES exhibit highlights the Group\u2019s current practical software-defined mobility services alongside technologies fostering the extension of SDx.\nThe SDV Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architecture represents the core hardware structure of SDV, showcasing the operational framework and functional structure where the vehicle\u2019s cameras, radars and sensors gather driving environment data, enabling autonomous driving through the integrated controller, a High-Performance Vehicle Computer (HPVC) embedded within the vehicle.

A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nHONDA\u2019S HEADED BACK TO THE FUTURE\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nELECTRIC FLYING CARS PROMISE TO BECOME REALITY\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "Cookie Disclaimer\nBasket Overview\nHyundai Motor Reveals Vision for Hydrogen Energy and Software Solutions Beyond Mobility at CES 2024\nLAS VEGAS, January 8, 2024 \u2013 Hyundai Motor Company today presented its vision for a hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation beyond mobility applications at CES 2024. Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company held its Media Day at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas to highlight its future blueprint for a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a vision for software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn line with Hyundai Motor\u2019s brand vision, \u2018Progress for Humanity,\u2019 the \u2018Ease every way\u2019 theme reflects the company\u2019s aim to create a comfortable and peaceful living environment by providing three core universal values of freedom, safety, and fairness for the global community. It goes beyond the mere physical utility value of technology and caters to the complex daily lives of people, providing freedom from various limitations, safety in communities from software security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through hydrogen, and fair accessibility to clean energy and related services.\n\"At Hyundai, we believe that science and humanity are two sides of the same coin; that advanced technology should also make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Jay Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cClean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, President and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cOur theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\u201d\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO \u00a0from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d\u00a0said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business.\u00a0\u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors. Having seen the real-world applications already being delivered by Hyundai, we\u2019re excited that Georgia is part of Hyundai\u2019s future.\u201d\nSDx: Building a user-centered mobility ecosystem by defining vehicles, fleets and \u00a0transportation systems with software and AI\nHyundai is undergoing a software-driven transformation led by the entire Group. As a provider of smart mobility solutions, Hyundai recognizes the importance of software and AI in creating a user-centric mobility ecosystem. At CES, the company announced its \u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019 (SDx) strategy, which aims to transform all moving devices, fleets and ecosystems into valuable assets through advanced software and AI.\nThrough its SDx strategy, the Group seeks to develop a mobility ecosystem that meets the needs of users anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, the Group is transitioning everything into a software-defined approach, from vehicle development to building the entire mobility ecosystem. It believes software and AI are enablers of achieving this vision through providing holistic user experience without limitations and is dedicated to delivering mobility services and solutions that prioritize convenience and safety.\nThe Group\u2019s strategy begins with developing \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV). This means to incorporate software development methods to automotive development which means to decouple hardware and software to enable independent updates and advancement of each. The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "HD Hyundai to Showcase Xite Innovation at CES 2024\nHD Hyundai will showcase its technological innovation for future infrastructure construction that goes beyond time and space at CES 2024.\nThe company\u2019s 10,994-sq.-ft. booth, nearly twice the size of the booth at CES 2023, will be open Jan. 9-12 and is located in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Exhibit 4517 in the West Hall.\nThe main theme HD Hyundai has set for this year is \u201cXite Transformation,\u201d a site vision which aims to solve pressing challenges humanity is facing such as safety, security, supply chain issues, climate change and more. To demonstrate this vision, the company\u2019s booth will be a living blueprint of what future construction sites will look like, including its proprietary autonomous technology.\nThe booth will highlight three main zones: Future Xite, Twin Xite and Zero Xite. An HD Hyundai expert will perform a remote control demonstration of a wheel loader located in Atlanta \u2014 nearly 2,000 miles from the Las Vegas Convention Center. Additionally, the booth will feature a remote control wheel loader simulator and a Virtual Reality Twin simulation where visitors can experience future construction sites in person.\nA 60-ft.-high, 15-ft.-wide LED screen will display an autonomous job site that creates optimized operations and presents fleet and safe machine management features using analyzed site information collected through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies.\nA 15-ft.-tall unmanned wheel excavator will greet visitors as they enter the booth. The excavator features a cabless design, a radar sensor and smart AAVM (All-Around View Monitoring) camera system that registers nearby obstacles and minimizes the potential for accidents while moving autonomously. It is also equipped with four individual wheels that enable the machine to climb steep hills and reduce the need for operators to work in harsh sites that may be potentially dangerous. These innovative enhancements designed with safety and efficiency in mind truly make the excavator a machine for the future.\nWith the technologies it is exhibiting at CES 2024, HD Hyundai is working to lead the construction industry by prioritizing opportunities in future technology fields like autonomous equipment that are still in the early stages of development.\nHD Hyundai has been a top global player in advanced technologies and was the first to present 5G remote control across countries for construction equipment in 2018. In 2019, the company successfully demonstrated Concept-X, the comprehensive unmanned and automated construction site solution which oversees all operations at site from survey to fleet management.\nA representative of HD Hyundai said, \u201cOur booth at CES 2024 will let people see and experience different smart construction solutions for future sites in one single place and showcase our expertise in technological innovation for infrastructure construction that will shape a more sustainable future for humanity.\u201d\nHD Hyundai Vice Chairman and CEO Kisun Chung will give a keynote speech at CES 2024 on Wednesday, Jan. 10 at 9 a.m. The keynote will be given at the Venetian hotel in the Palazzo Ballroom on Level 5. HD Hyundai is the only Korean company to speak at this year\u2019s keynote stage.\nAppendix: What to expect at the three different themed zones.1. Future XiteFuture Xite will introduce autonomous solutions that will help solve issues at construction sites, such as the lack of skilled workforce, low productivity and dangerous working environments. A 15-foot-tall cabless excavator and future autonomous construction site features such as drone-based site analysis can also be found here.\n2. Twin XiteTwin Xite will present future construction solutions that are no longer restricted by time and space as it utilizes remote control and site simulations created with digital twin technology. Visitors will be able to experience activities such as Smart Site Management, which uses a digital platform for users to discover and solve issues on land and sea. They will also be able to remotely control equipment using a simulator within the Twin Xite zone along with VR Twin, which displays the future work sites that HD Hyundai envisions.\n3. Zero XiteZero Xite will represent HD Hyundai\u2019s efforts to realize an era of zero-carbon emissions. There will be a large curved screen which will show an eco-friendly energy value chain that focuses on the global efforts to reach zero emissions. How HD Hyundai produces, supplies and utilizes energy can be seen all together through the process of how hydrogen and electric energy is produced, shipped and utilized from ocean to land.\nPost navigation\nRelated posts\nLatest Digital Issues\n2023 Cement Directory\nRecent Posts\nResource Center\nCement Products\n\u00a9 2023 by SEMCO Publishing, LLC | All rights reserved."

The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention.

The company will present 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production.\nAt CES, Mobis will focus its efforts on growing its international sales by targeting global clients. Various products in areas such as automotive components, electrification, lamp and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will be showcased to potential clients, including its future mobility core technologies, such as the Innovative Display series \u00e2\u20ac\u201d rich in high-value advanced technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\nThe Innovative Display series, which is a collection of high-value, cutting-edge technologies, will be the focus at the Mobis exhibition. The company will present its leading innovative display technologies for automobiles, such as the world's first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, as well as the Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display (QL) display and 3D display that feature OLED-level performance in LCD.\nA transparent display forautomobiles will be presented for the first time during the exhibition. This product is a next-generation display which employs holographic optical elements technology. The display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays.\u00c2\nTransparent displays enable images to be magnified on the front windshield. Thus, drivers can check various display information without shifting their gaze too much, increasing the level of safety. Because of their unique features, it is expected that transparent displays will bring many changes to future automobile designs once they are mass produced. Estimates indicate significant demand from global car manufacturers, creating high expectations for the display's future technological development and mass production.\u00c2\nInnovative technologies in the field of electrification, the driving force for future growth, also await to be selected by global automakers based on Mobis' abundant mass production know-how. At the center of electric driving is the 22 kW-class ICCU, which Mobis proudly presents along with its battery system (BSA).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\nICCU is a key element for electric vehicle charging and driving and is a power conversion system integrating elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\u00c2\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\u00c2\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention. This system allows all four wheels to turn 90 degrees, enabling parallel movement.\n* Hyundai Mobis Booth: Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall #5216\u00c2\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea.
