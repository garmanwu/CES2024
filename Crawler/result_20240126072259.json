        "raw_content": "Light projector wins CES Innovation Award 2024\nPlastic Omnium, a member of the ISELED Alliance, has been honoured with an Innovation Award at CES 2024.\nThe award, presented in the \u2018In-Vehicle Entertainment\u2019 category, recognises its dynamic interior dashboard projection system.\nThis system brings the dashboard to life with a spectrum of colours and patterns that can be adjusted to the driver\u2019s preference. It is already a feature in the interior of the new MINI Cooper Electric, offering an engaging driving experience with its combination of lights, animations, and projections.\nThe system's illumination is powered by eight high-power ISELED RGB LEDs from Dominant Opto Technologies, known for supplying LEDs to the automotive market. These high-power RGB LEDs have a luminance of 60 lumens and are managed by 3 smart ISELED RGB LED controllers from Inova Semiconductors. Dominant and Inova, like Plastic Omnium, are members of the ISELED Alliance.\nThe success of this projection system is attributed to the collaborative efforts of various ISELED Alliance members. Each member brought its unique technology and expertise to the project, demonstrating the strength of the ECO System. The visionaries from Plastic Omnium, Lightworks, Dominant, and Inova worked closely with the Design & Development Team of the OEM, evolving this concept into a mass-produced product.\nPanasonic PhotoMOS\u00ae Photovoltaic MOSFET High-Power Drivers\nAdam-Tech Wire-to-Board Solutions\nFurther reading\nA selection of Awards articles for further reading"

        "raw_content": "Plastic Omnium honoured at the CES 2024 Innovation Awards\nEvent / Date from Plastic Omnium SE\nLaurent Favre, Plastic Omnium's Chief Executive Officer, says: \u201cInnovation is at the heart of our strategy. Through these three partnerships, Plastic Omnium adds intelligent functions - displays, sensors, lighting - into body panels to enhance the driver experience, making it safer, smarter and more appealing.\u201dIntelligent management of rear lights with Sonatus, a major player in the Software Defined Vehicle ecosystemPlastic Omnium and Sonatus together bring intelligence to enhance dynamic vehicle lighting. The solution developed with Sonatus enables monitoring and retrieving information from various onboard sensors in the car to interpret situations that may arise on the road. Using Sonatus Automator, vehicle sensors can automatically trigger animated informational or warning messages without driver action on Plastic Omnium mini-LED display in the rear light assembly of the vehicle. For example, if the driver encounters pedestrians crossing the street, a \"pedestrian crossing\" visual animation is displayed on the rear of the vehicle to inform the car behind to be cautious, even before the driver begins braking. This automated capability adds intelligence to dynamic vehicle lighting systems to improve safety and driver convenience on the road.Plastic Omnium and EyeLights team up to showcase high-brightness and high-resolution smart tailgatePlastic Omnium innovates with the EyeLights startup to offer a groundbreaking technology: a highdefinition, high brightness display capability at the rear of vehicles. The technology aims to better communicate with the vehicle surroundings, short and long distances and in any weather conditions. Whether during a sudden slowdown or to signal an object on the road, the technology developed with EyeLights, combined with the expertise of Plastic Omnium, will enhance safety for all road users. Facial recognition built with ParavisionParavision\u2019s facial recognition technology creates a template of vehicle owners' faces, and will only allow registered and authorized persons to access the vehicle. Notably, the technology does not store the photographs; instead, it mathematically processes the created face templates, significantly enhancing accuracy and reliability (achieving a better than 99.8% success rate for registered individuals). Plastic Omnium incorporates these capabilities into various vehicle components and auto body parts by integrating sensors between the vehicles front and rear doors, and the roof module. This innovative solution substantially minimizes fraudulent activities, as the vehicle remains inaccessible without the presence of the genuine driver's face.\n(Source and further information: External company website)\nMore news from Plastic Omnium SE\nMatching news and content\nThe publisher indicated in each case is solely responsible for the press releases above, the event or job offer displayed, and the image and sound material used (see company info when clicking on image/message title or company info right column).
