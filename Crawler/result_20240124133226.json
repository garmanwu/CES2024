Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation. The company is committed to providing optimized hydrogen mobility solutions, building on the foundation of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\nAlso on display, the mobile fuel cell generator supplies electricity solely through the fuel cell stack without the need for additional auxiliary power storage devices. It can be used in various fields and can provide power in emergencies, such as power outages, or challenging environments where accessing another power supply is difficult.\nThe mobile fuel cell generator is actively used in Electric Touring Car Racing (ETCR) competitions. To ensure the seamless operation of high-performance electric vehicles for all participating companies in the competition, Hyundai Motor has established a charging infrastructure using its hydrogen fuel cell system. The racing cars in the ETCR series recharge their batteries using electricity generated by the fuel cell generator produced by the Group.\nNext to the media table, a sectional model displays the operating principle of a portable hydrogen fuel cell generator, allowing a detailed examination of its structure for easy understanding.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram provides environmentally friendly public transportation, contributing to the purification and production of clean air. The hydrogen fuel cell tram is equipped with four hydrogen fuel cells with a capacity of 95 kW and can travel up to 150 km. It purifies approximately 800 \u03bcg of fine dust and produces 107.6 kg of clean air per hour of operation.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram is wireless, which does not require tram overhead lines, improving the aesthetics of the city and reducing infrastructure costs. Hyundai Rotem will continuously expand its lineup, including hydrogen high-speed trains, electric multiple units and locomotives.\nBooth visitors can also learn about how Hyundai Steel is preparing to establish a green steel production system to cut carbon emissions in the steel production process. It aims to reduce both direct and indirect carbon emissions by 12 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBy introducing eco-friendly processes that replace blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces and utilizing hydrogen and renewable energy instead of coal energy, the carbon emissions in the steel production process are significantly reduced.\nHyundai Motor is emphasizing its commitment to realizing the hydrogen vision at the Group level by showcasing a video inside the exhibition booth that explains the hydrogen demonstration projects and core technologies conducted by the group. This effort aims to highlight the company\u2019s ongoing dedication to making the hydrogen vision a reality.\nFostering a paradigm shift with the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019)\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai Motor showcases exhibits and videos introducing core \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) technologies under development by the Group\u2019s global software center, 42dot, emphasizing the importance of software (SW) and AI in becoming a smart mobility solutions provider.\nHyundai Motor aims to redefine everything from vehicles to all surrounding environments with SW and AI, promoting the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019). Its CES exhibit highlights the Group\u2019s current practical software-defined mobility services alongside technologies fostering the extension of SDx.\nThe SDV Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architecture represents the core hardware structure of SDV, showcasing the operational framework and functional structure where the vehicle\u2019s cameras, radars and sensors gather driving environment data, enabling autonomous driving through the integrated controller, a High-Performance Vehicle Computer (HPVC) embedded within the vehicle. This exhibit illustrates how the vehicle\u2019s hardware structure gets simplified through the transition toward SDV, providing a more intuitive view.\nBased on driving scenes in Pangyo, South Korea played on the display in the front of the exhibit, actual road scenarios, such as left and right turns, are staged to illustrate the data flow where the HPVC and zone controllers for autonomous driving are activated according to the road environment. This flow is visualized through LED lights. Moreover, it\u2019s possible to observe the operation of a \u2018fault-tolerant\u2019 function within SDV safety features, where even if one controller malfunctions, another controller takes over to ensure safe driving.\nThe HPVC exhibited alongside the SDV architecture serves as the integrated hardware consolidating core SDV technologies. It controls all other controllers within the SDV, functioning as the brain of the SDV, enabling the application of software technologies in the vehicle. The HPVC aids in driving assistance and acts as a gateway between data generated within the vehicle, facilitating the application of software technologies in the vehicle. It plays a significant role, vastly enhancing the vehicle\u2019s performance, safety and convenience.\nTwo HPVC models developed by 42dot are available at one of the six media tables in the central software section within the booth. These models differ in their cooling methods: one uses air cooling, dissipating heat through air, while the other utilizes liquid cooling with water.\n42dot is not only developing HPVC and controllers but also developing an SDV operating system, SDV OS, to ensure stable and efficient operation of in-vehicle applications. On the additional five media tables positioned to the right and above the HPVC exhibits, visitors can watch videos introducing the five core SDV technologies under development by 42dot and a film of various Group-wide practical software-defined mobility services in motion that are being operated today.\nThe five core technologies introduced through the videos include:\n\u2022HPVC and SDV OS: A modern data center-like network architecture and fault-tolerant system for SDVs\n\u2022Data-Driven Learning Systems: Continuous integration and deployment of autonomous driving from R&D to commercial robo-taxi service through MLOps and DataOps\n\u2022Safety-Designed Vehicle: Technology for cybersecurity and safe driving control\n\u2022LLM for Advanced Mobility: Conversational AI assistant that enhances human-like interaction between SDVs and drivers/passengers\n\u2022Self-Managed Smart City: SDV technologies extending beyond vehicles into the city\nFurthermore, Hyundai Motor displays a video on software-defined mobility services in motion equipped with advanced technologies operated by various companies within the Group. The video features the on-demand shuttle \u2018Shucle\u2019, autonomous mobility platform \u2018TAP!\u2019 and Motional\u2019s IONIQ 5-based autonomous taxi service \u2018Robotaxi\u2019.\nDICE\u318dSPACE\u318dCITY POD: Experience future mobility realizing the human-centered vision\nThe Group will unveil a hydrogen-based mobility service concept that connects everyone\u2019s life, providing an experience of convenience and freedom of movement in line with the vision of \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 as presented at CES 2024.\nIn this exhibition, visitors can explore the Group\u2019s future mobility solutions, spanning from personal mobility to public mobility and logistics, realizing a human-centered vision that extends from individuals to cities.\nDICE (Digital Curated Experience) infused with AI is a personal mobility platform that provides curated services through software technology customized to individuals. Through a display surrounded on three sides, a more immersive mobile experience is possible.\nThe \u2018Ring Pad\u2019 controller, a kinetic interface that is an evolved form of a fixed interface of existing vehicles, allows you to communicate with AI and adjust the environment of DICE. It includes a bio-sensing camera to create an optimized environment and an airbag for safety.\nWhen using DICE for travel, you can receive curated journey suggestions through personal device integration, which considers your schedule, destination and more. In addition, DICE can reroute in response to a sudden change in schedule and activate \u2018Therapy Mode,\u2019 which monitors the user\u2019s condition through continuous bio-sensing.\nHyundai aims to showcase the evolution into a platform with infinite possibilities, going beyond the traditional driver-passenger roles through spatial computing-based interfaces of DICE.\nWhile DICE is about personalized digital experiences during transportation, SPACE (Spatial Curated Experience) is about providing customized spatial experiences by incorporating individual lifestyles into the mobility space to embrace users across a wide spectrum of needs, along with free mobility.\nTo meet the varied needs of passengers, SPACE Mobility provides optimized space and adaptive seats. It also supports wheelchair users, micro-mobility users and pets through comfortable boarding height control.\nAlong with that, booth visitors can enjoy customized content through a large transparent display placed on doors. The AI service agent located in the interior console interacts with users, providing various information needed throughout the journey.\nNot only that, but SPACE also extends to an open area called the \u2018Pavilion\u2019, which is constructed from reused obsolete mobility modules. It is a concept that architecturally reinterprets the life cycle of mobility. It is characterized by the ability to impart various functions and usability to each module.\nIt interacts with the software environment through a hologram interface and provides portable battery slots and various charging modules for sharing energy through a hydrogen fuel cell system. It functions as a hub that connects people, city, robot and mobility, incorporating an air-cleaning algae module and a smart farm that utilizes water from the byproduct of a hydrogen fuel cell, along with a rest area featuring mobility seats.\nAlso on display is CITY POD, an unmanned large-scale mobility system that surpasses the limits of the existing logistics systems based on software. It presents an \u2018automatic logistics sorting system\u2019 that moves organically and actively at all stages.\nCITY POD with hydrogen energy technology adopts a modular system combining Plug & Drive and PnD POD, presenting an efficient and systematic middle mile and last mile logistics vision.

This means that there will be greater equality in the access to, and use of, energy. Just imagine a world where everyday waste is made into clean energy making our living spaces safe, clean, and free from pollution.\nWe are working on software that is optimized for users and guarantees free movement by connecting mobility options and the city in one place. Based on the data that is accumulated, our software can then proactively protect everyone even in dangerous situations.\nHyundai is making this world a reality with our hydrogen energy and software solutions.\nOur passion for hydrogen energy\nHydrogen energy is not a new thing for us. We have always held the belief that hydrogen energy is essential for the future. In fact, here at Hyundai, we have been developing hydrogen vehicles since 1998. That\u2019s 26 years of expertise already.\nIn 2013, we commercialized the world's first mass-produced Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the Tucson iX35 FCEV. We followed this with the launch of the NEXO in 2018 and achieved the top spot worldwide for sales of hydrogen vehicles.\nWith the launch of our hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck XCIENT Fuel Cell in 2020, we have further verified the excellent quality of our hydrogen mobility. Since 2020, our XCIENT Fuel Cell heavy-duty trucks in Switzerland has accumulated 8.7 million kilometers of cumulative driving in real-life customer operation.\nOur preparation for the future, which began with the development of hydrogen vehicles, has now expanded across our entire company. Our next goal is to provide comprehensive hydrogen-related solutions across the entire hydrogen value chain.\nWhat\u2019s more, to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society, we need to start using hydrogen on a larger scale. To this end, we will increase our hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes per year by 2035 and use this to propel a major transformation.\nThe HTWO Grid, end-to-end hydrogen solution\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to a hydrogen energy ecosystem requires a comprehensive solution that is tailored to the different needs of everyone who needs to use it.\nOur answer is HTWO Grid, an end-to-end hydrogen solution where the capabilities of every affiliate intersect at all stages of hydrogen production from storage and transportation to utilization. This will even offer customized solutions optimized for various environments and physical characteristics through its organic combinations and connections between each technology.\nWe already have different hydrogen solution packages in the United States and are under discussion with Indonesia on a waste-to-hydrogen production focused solution package. Especially, the Clean Logistics Project that will officially launch in the second half of 2024 is expected to drive a hydrogen society in Georgia. We plan to provide our solution to different regions, thus accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society in the future.\nTurning everyday waste into energy\nThe best-known method of producing clean hydrogen is water electrolysis, which produces hydrogen by splitting water. However, the availability of water is different from region to region. So, we became interested in ways to turn waste generated in everyday life into hydrogen.\nWaste-to-energy technology, which we introduced at CES 2024, is a technology that converts sewage, food waste, livestock manure, and plastic waste that is concerned as a headache to all countries.\nWaste-to-energy technology is largely divided into two types. Firstly, waste-to-hydrogen technology is a method that decomposes organic waste with microorganisms to generate biogas and convert this into hydrogen. Secondly, plastic-to-hydrogen technology is a method of obtaining hydrogen by gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements. Hyundai Motor Group is already in action to produce hydrogen from biogas in Chungju city in Korea.\nBoth technologies have a double positive effect (win-win) as they fix two problems: they can obtain clean hydrogen energy while reducing the waste around us.\nProviding freedom to move through software and AI\nBeyond vehicles, we are also expanding into SDx which means \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d. This means redefining vehicles, fleets, transportation system and beyond, with software and AI.\nWe aspire to create a user-centred, safer, and more convenient mobility ecosystem through software and AI, because they allow everything to be connected without the constraints of time and space.\nThe first thing we\u2019ve been working on is a shift in development. When a \u201csoftware-defined\u201d approach is applied to automobiles, all features can be designed and updated based on user\u2019s mobility journey.\nSoftware can quickly improve the vehicle's user experience and safety features, driving performance, and app services. It can even define a vehicle\u2019s entire identity.\nSo through software and AI, we want to connect mobility, logistics solutions with devices and city operations systems, and transform the way the world moves. Hyundai see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation.\nThe whole SDx journey is driven by the values of convenience and safety, which have always been a priority for Hyundai Motor Group. Using software to fulfill our \u201cService-defined, Safety-designed\u201d philosophy will help us strengthen and evolve these values even more.\nDreaming of a new mobility ecosystem with our vision for SDx\nOur vision for SDx begins with SDV (software-defined vehicle). For this, we plan to incorporate software development practice into vehicle development, allowing independent updates and advancement of software and hardware. This increases agility and scalability of vehicle development, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nWith the spread of SDVs in the market, data and platforms will be increasingly connected therefore management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Hyundai will expand its software solutions to business customers and provide insights, by enabling optimal operation and management of vehicles, and real-time data analytics to issues for fleet operators.\nAs vehicles and fleets get defined and developed by software, they will eventually become AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers. Through automated and autonomous development, improvement and updates of devices and solutions, mobility in general will become efficient and accessible, adding value for users.\nHyundai is dreaming where HMG's various software technologies and platforms are combined to lay the foundation for a \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019, where an entire self-operating urban transportation system is connected and run through software and AI.\nUsers will be provided with transportation-as-a-service, all any mobility and logistics solutions needed in time. With all software-defined HMG devices, from vehicles to AAM, robotics to smart factories, all connected within the mobility ecosystem seamlessly.\nOpening up infinite possibilities with Hyundai\u2019s future mobility\nAt CES 2024, we introduced our future mobility concept with roots in hydrogen, software fused with robotics technology to ease our lives in every way. We are expanding \u201cmovement\u201d beyond limitations, here are some of the things you can look forward to seeing from us in the future.\nDICE (Digital Curated Experience)\nSoftware combined with AI technology offers a whole new mobility experience. For example, DICE is a personal mobility concept that delivers a personalized curated experience, which makes the time spent moving more valuable.\nDICE linked with AI recognizes you anytime, anywhere, and provides optimized services. It can also be connected with a personal device to create a customized environment. DICE\u2019s three-sided Transparent OLED create immersive personalized experiences. The ring pad controller, a kinetic interface that is an evolved form of the \u2018fixed interface\u2019 dashboard of existing vehicles, allows you to communicate with AI and adjust the environment of DICE. DICE can process individual preferences and movement environments to deliver a continuous curation of optimized content even while you\u2019re enroute.\nSPACE (Spatial Curated Experience)\nThe development of software technology has opened a wide spectrum of possibilities for space within mobility. SPACE, social mobility concept, is based on inclusivity and circularity. It embraces diverse needs with inclusive and social value, providing free movement and customized spatial experiences for all.\nSPACE \u2013 Mobility: This multi-seater public mobility system gives everyone, including people with mobility impairments, unrestricted access to travel experiences. The interior space is reinterpreted as a personalized space supported by autonomous driving, AI and \u2018Adaptive Seat\u2019 stored within the walls. Boarding height control allows easy boarding of wheelchairs and provides the perfect solution for last mile mobility for you, your pets and any other guests.\nSPACE \u2013 Pavilion: Obsolete SPACE modules are reinterpreted as architectural elements and reassembled into the shape of a pavilion, offering inclusive usability even to disadvantaged areas. It features a Hologram Interface for communicating with the software environment. The hydrogen energy system supports portable battery slots and various charging modules, providing smart farms and air-cleaning algae modules using water by-products. The seats provide a space to rest. SPACE-Pavilion is a physical hub connecting people with the city, robots, and mobility.\nCITY POD\nWe also offer future logistics that grant mobility solutions that go beyond the limits of the current logistics system and move freely and organically at every stage. CITY POD is capable of a digital twin control that was systematically organized both above and below ground utilizing AI. It also offers logistics within the city, leveraging future technologies such as Crab walk and autonomous driving to maximize efficiency. It provides a diverse range of uses not only in logistics but also in future life and industrial sites, including public transportation, industrial material and waste transportation, hydrogen energy transportation, and automatic refueling support.\nStretch\nStretch is our versatile, autonomous robot for safer and more efficient warehouse operations. Today, Stretch is out in the real world, unloading floor-loaded trailers and shipping containers on behalf of humans. In the next few years, Stretch will become a multi-purpose case-handling robot that will enable the lights-out warehouse of the future. Soon after, Stretch may be able to handle a variety of manipulation tasks, even outside of the warehouse. These robots are exceptional, intelligent machines that enrich people\u2019s lives by protecting humans from dangerous, repetitive, and physically challenging activities.\nThe dawn of a new world\nAlthough both hydrogen energy and software are invisible, they are like the air that exists all around us.

        "raw_content": "Hyundai brings electric excavators, AI, and see-thru steel to CES 2024\nThe HD division of Hyundai brought some seriously impressive technology to CES 2024, which includes a full-scale version of its AI-powered Concept X excavator, a sneak peek at invisible implement technology, and some autonomous hardware that looks ready for prime time.\nHD Hyundai concept X + Xite Transformation\nFirst shown as a scale model of a future autonomous excavator at a South Korean equipment show back in 2020, the Hyundai-Doosan Concept X has grown up. Way up!\nThis full-scale version of the HD Hyundai Concept X excavator towers nearly 15 feet above the crowds that were shuffling through at the Las Vegas Convention Center this week, where it appeared with four articulating \u201ctank feet\u201d powered by electric drive and notably without a drivers\u2019 cab\u2026 which is very much the point: to show off Hyundai\u2019s Xite Transformation technology suite.\n\u201cXite Transformation is HD Hyundai\u2019s site vision for future construction sites that aims to solve pressing issues humanity is facing such as safety, security, supply chain issues, climate change, and more,\u201d explains Young-cheul Cho, the president and CEO of HD Hyundai XiteSolution and Hyundai Infracore.\nThe other pressing issue Xite Transformation is hoping to solve is, of course, the seemingly chronic shortage of skilled equipment operators and commercial drivers on construction sites. \u201cSkilled operators\u2026 have become increasingly rare, and the dearth of such personnel appears to be a permanent shift in culture, not simply a short-term aberration,\u201d writes Richard Ries at Equipment World. \u201cXite Transformation will\u2026 reduce reliance on operators until the autonomous worksite is a reality, and the lack of operators is no longer a hindrance to productivity.\u201d\nThe concept excavator boasts \u201cfully electric\u201d operation \u2013\u00a0which is to say that it has both electric drive and makes use of electric motors and actuators to operate the boom arm, rather than hydraulic oil \u2013\u00a0and is the first of three such concepts to debut. The other two, an articulated hauler and compact wheel loader (shown, below) are expected to bow in 2025.\nBut wait \u2013\u00a0there\u2019s more!\nWhile it\u2019s not busy making heavy equipment operators obsolete, HD Hyundai is working to make their lives easier by developing new technology that allows operators to \u201csee through\u201d their machine\u2019s metal bucket.\nIt works using a suite of sensors, cameras, and monitors to project a digitized image of whatever rocks or blocks or assorted detritus is inside the bucket, and serves to give operators a better idea of what they have in there \u2013\u00a0which could help them anticipate shifting loads or damaging dangerous electrical or gas lines. And, if it sounds familiar, that\u2019s probably because it is.\nTier 1 automotive and e-bike powertrain supplier Valeo introduced the XtraVue \u201cinvisible trailer\u201d system back in 2019, which used a similar array of cameras to allow drivers to \u201csee through\u201d whatever they were towing. You can see both systems side-by-side, below.\nElectrek\u2019s Take\nI\u2019m not convinced that AI and fully-autonomous equipment will ever fully replace skilled operators in changing or unpredictable conditions \u2013\u00a0but there\u2019s certainly a case to be made for automated equipment working in fairly controlled environments to, for example, dig a long ditch to a certain depth (among other repetitive tasks). In those cases, a small fleet of Concept X-style machines powered by Xite Transformation and guided by a skilled operator acting as a sort of \u201crobot taskmaster\u201d could get quite a lot done, regardless of whether or not we ever solve the construction industry\u2019s latest driver shortage.\nAnd, before you dismiss all of this as pie-in-the-sky concept trash and attention-seeking vaporware, consider this: Hyundai also showed off another driverless construction machine. And this one, it claims, is nearly production-ready.\nTop comment by Actually Thoughtful\nThe mindless pursuit of vehicle autonomy is painful to watch, and it is\nS L O W I N G the transition to clean energy. Electrify these vehicles! The rest is just noise.\nThe Concept-X2 autonomous dozer shown here first debuted at ConExpo back in August, and is based on the Hyundai Develon (formerly Doosan) DD100, marking the companies\u2019 first entries into the autonomous machine category.\nWe\u2019ll write more about that one when they make it electric.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

We are unveiling the new E/E architecture for SDV and core SDV (software-defined vehicle) technologies created by 42dot, Hyundai Motor Group's Global Software Center, at our CES booth, marking a significant milestone in our ongoing journey to advancing software-defined vehicle technology.\nSDV Technologies Presented at CES 2024\n1. New E&E Architecture for SDV Demo\nWith the ever-expanding features integrated into modern mobility, cars today harbor intricate E/E (electrical and electronics) architectures. We recognize this complexity as an opportunity, and it\u2019s this challenge that\u2019s behind the software-defined vehicle (SDV) model we\u2019ve been working on for HMG\u2019s transition into a software company. Our SDV framework hinges on a hardware and software decoupled structure, a solution that simplifies the vehicle\u2019s architecture and empowers engineers to focus on software development. This strategic decoupling grants engineers the flexibility and agility to enhance vehicle system development while ensuring unparalleled user-centric experiences.\nTo achieve this decoupling in SDVs, we recognized the necessity to develop a universal hardware platform capable of abstracting and efficiently managing the vehicle's computing infrastructure and sensor/actuator configurations. That\u2019s where 42dot comes in; they are leading the development of the new E/E architecture for SDV.\nThis new technology takes center stage at our CES booth, showcasing its prowess in securely overseeing autonomous driving functionalities while efficiently managing the vehicle's computing, sensors, and actuators which ensure safe driving - even in the face of a hardware or network failure- underscoring our commitment to safety and user experience in SDV development.\n2. HPVC and SDV OS\nAt the crux of the new E/E architecture for SDV, there is the HPVC (high-performance vehicle computer), also known as the brain. At CES, we have unveiled two variations of HPVC \u2013 the air-cooled and water-cooled models. These HPVC units are the powerhouse of computation within the SDVs, integrating various functions while assuming the position of primary control. With the HPVC, Hyundai's SDVs can streamline hardware by consolidating multiple roles and features into a single unit, reducing the reliance on numerous hardware controllers or multiple domain controllers.\nThere are four main functions the HPVC integrates into the vehicle:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Autonomous driving stacks covering from Level 2 ADAS to Level 4 automated driving systems, to enhance the user\u2019s safe mobility experience.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0In-vehicle infotainment (IVI) for communication between the vehicle and the driver/passenger.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Data gateway interconnects HPVC and controllers via a high-speed Ethernet backbone network and handles (collecting, exchanging and storing) a large amount of data internally through high bandwidth and throughput communication.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Connectivity via RF communication to send and receive data outside the vehicle via LTE (5G), BT/WIFI, etc.\nThe SDV OS efficiently manages applications across the vehicle built with the new E/E architecture, and effectively runs applications on physically distributed hardware, ensuring reliability and efficiency. Additionally, through the unified vehicle API, it enables vehicles composed of physically distributed hardware to be virtually managed as a single product, maximizing software flexibility and optimizing resource utilization across the vehicle. 42dot\u2019s SDV OS is powered by Rust, to operate a mission-critical system that ensures safety.\n3. Data-Driven Learning Systems\nAutonomous driving technology is a key component of SDVs. To build a smart AI system, 42dot is transforming vehicles into learning machines with the goal of not only advancing AI engineering but also bringing AI & autonomous driving technology to the public. 42dot is continuously collecting, curating, and training data to validate AI models and improve camera-based autonomous driving technology. To optimize the process, they have integrated an agile development of two-week sprints of engineering, performing simulation, deploying into R&D fleets, and eventually deploying software into service fleets. 42dot automates the training, optimization, deployment, and integration process to enhance efficiency (CI/CD). The MLOps and DataOps methodology enables 42dot to create a framework for rapid improvements of AI in mobility.\n4. Safety-Designed Vehicle\nSafety is our utmost priority, hence 42dot is implementing safety in all aspects of SDV hardware and software such as strengthening the cybersecurity of SDVs, redundant vehicle network and enhancing safe driving practices.\n42dot is committed to developing a comprehensive, integrated SDV security solution that addresses cybersecurity concerns across multiple facets, encompassing the protection of personal information and the prevention of unauthorized data access.\nMoreover, safe driving can be enhanced with AI. The SDV's AI algorithms employ 3D camera vision to perceive its surroundings, anticipate the vehicle's trajectory based on driver input, and alert against potential collisions with obstacles. This data is sent to the cloud and shared with other vehicles.\n5. LLM for Advanced Mobility\nLarge language models (LLM) harness the power to learn intricate language structures and when implemented correctly, they have the potential to change the way we move. Now, most existing vehicle AI assistants provide responses in a single-turn method. However, LLM-based assistants offer seamless multi-turn conversations that mirror human interactions. Empowered with the language structures trained from vast amounts of data, 42dot\u2019s AI assistant, based on its own LLM, can generate proper human-like responses.\n42dot\u2019s own AI assistant will be integrated into various in-vehicle infotainment apps and connected services such as AI assistant, AI navigation, autonomous driving, intelligent fleet safety & management - the possibilities are endless. The AI assistant can provide tailored recommendations based on one\u2019s habits and lifestyle. It can also generate necessary human readable/listenable alerts which improves the efficiency of fleet management.\n6. Self-Managed Smart City\nSDV technologies can extend to fleets and into cities to optimize businesses and cities\u2019 transportation infrastructure. 42dot provides safe, user-centric autonomous technology and mobility algorithms to provide optimized routing based on real-time data. Road data managed via the cloud is shared with all SDV equipped vehicles to provide optimal mobility services.\nAll mobility information such as vehicle, driver, trip data, and real-time traffic information is digitized and managed via a centralized FMS (fleet management system). Vehicle collisions and accidents are handled with AI-driven accident alerts and reporting systems. The 42dot system automatically notifies relevant parties and creates documentation for operation needs. All driver, vehicle and traffic data including video clips are tamper-resistant, managed and protected with blockchain technology.\nThese technologies not only enable us to manage fleets but also efficiently manage the movement of cities through \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d.\n7. Software-Defined Mobility in Motion\nHyundai Motor Group advances SDV and mobility technologies to provide customer-oriented mobility experiences.\nHMC\u2019s Shucle, a DRT (demand response transport) shuttle service based on AI dynamic routing, dynamically monitors community operations and traffic flow in real-time, providing the most efficient routes for all the passengers in the shuttle.\n42dot\u2019s \u2018TAP!\u2019, the official autonomous mobility platform of Seoul, is leading the commercialization of autonomous mobility. The platform accommodates multiple autonomous vehicles from different providers, including 42dot, in seven different service locations. Users can dispatch different routes and autonomous vehicles such as autonomous taxis and shuttles.\nMotional\u2019s \u2018Robotaxi\u2019, the IONIQ-based level 4 self-driving taxi service to come soon in Las Vegas, is on the cusp of transforming into a fully driverless operation. Robotaxi will leverage cutting-edge technology - such as state-of-the-art 3D detection technology integrating cameras and lidar - that captures and interprets real-time surroundings to provide advanced autonomous driving.\nAre you ready to explore the ground-breaking innovations Hyundai unveiled at CES 2024?\nFollow @hyundai on instagram to join us on our journey to bringing 'Progress for Humanity'.\nShare\nKeyword\nVEHICLES\nIONIQ 5\nREAD MORE\nRead More Articles\nFuture mobility services\nCES 2024: Hyundai transitions to hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation to ease every way\nFuture mobility services\nIONIQ 5-based Robotaxi \u2013 the safe bet for getting around Las Vegas\nfooter menus\n\u24d2 2024 Hyundai Motor Company\nCLOSE"

        "raw_content": "Cookie Disclaimer\nBasket Overview\nHyundai Motor Reveals Vision for Hydrogen Energy and Software Solutions Beyond Mobility at CES 2024\nLAS VEGAS, January 8, 2024 \u2013 Hyundai Motor Company today presented its vision for a hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation beyond mobility applications at CES 2024. Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company held its Media Day at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas to highlight its future blueprint for a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a vision for software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn line with Hyundai Motor\u2019s brand vision, \u2018Progress for Humanity,\u2019 the \u2018Ease every way\u2019 theme reflects the company\u2019s aim to create a comfortable and peaceful living environment by providing three core universal values of freedom, safety, and fairness for the global community. It goes beyond the mere physical utility value of technology and caters to the complex daily lives of people, providing freedom from various limitations, safety in communities from software security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through hydrogen, and fair accessibility to clean energy and related services.\n\"At Hyundai, we believe that science and humanity are two sides of the same coin; that advanced technology should also make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Jay Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cClean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, President and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cOur theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\u201d\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO \u00a0from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d\u00a0said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business.\u00a0\u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors.

As a provider of smart mobility solutions, Hyundai recognizes the importance of software and AI in creating a user-centric mobility ecosystem. At CES, the company announced its \u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019 (SDx) strategy, which aims to transform all moving devices, fleets and ecosystems into valuable assets through advanced software and AI.\nThrough its SDx strategy, the Group seeks to develop a mobility ecosystem that meets the needs of users anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, the Group is transitioning everything into a software-defined approach, from vehicle development to building the entire mobility ecosystem. It believes software and AI are enablers of achieving this vision through providing holistic user experience without limitations and is dedicated to delivering mobility services and solutions that prioritize convenience and safety.\nThe Group\u2019s strategy begins with developing \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV). This means to incorporate software development methods to automotive development which means to decouple hardware and software to enable independent updates and advancement of each. The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "Consumer Technology Association\nCES 2024: Rubber hits the road for the connected car\nThe world\u2019s leading consumer electronics show has changed \u2013 from connected kitchens and cleaners, it is now, say some, the Detroit Auto Show on steroids. We see which roads are about to be taken in this new space for computing\nTo aficionados, CES has always meant days of madness, with visitors to its home at the Las Vegas Convention Centre (LVCC) surrounded by a morass of newfangled consumer electronics. In the past, these have ranged from TVs measuring hundreds of inches and displays covering whole walls, to connected kettles, fridges and other kitchen appliances, to robotic vacuum cleaners and robots of varied forms. The internet of things (IoT) in its truest sense.\nYet at CES 2024, in what probably is the first true post-Covid show, there was a very apparent, and almost literal, new drive to the event. While all of the varied connected appliances and technologies were there in force as ever \u2013 with the leaders in TV and video, such as Sony, Panasonic and Hisense, showing off their latest ranges \u2013 the main attention hit the highway, with connected automotive use cases exemplifying the emergence of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) in what industry leaders are calling the new era of computing.\nThis point was made very strongly in one of the keynote addresses. Fox\u202fBusiness Network\u2019s Liz Claman noted that she had been coming to CES for many a year and that she could remember the first time the industry arrived at the show in the middle of the last decade in the form of former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, the first auto executive of his status to be invited to speak there.\nWhile making the case that in-vehicle connectivity is nothing new, Claman said CES 2024 showed just how far it had come in that time and that CES was now effectively the Detroit Auto Show \u2013 the flagship event for the industry as a whole \u2013 \u201con steroids\u201d.\nCES showed car manufacturers\u2019 rapid increase in the electrification of their product lines, leading to a sharp increase in in-car electronics such as digital cockpits,\u202fadvanced driver assistance systems\u202f(ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment systems.\nClaman was not alone in her take. Just before the doors opened on CES, analyst IDTechEx released a report forecasting a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in automotive software-related revenue by 2034, putting software-related revenue at more than $700bn annually.\nThe study,\u202fConnected and software-defined vehicles 2024-2034: markets, forecasts, technologies,\u202fnoted that the most basic form of SDV is where the user experience is affected in some way by the software in a vehicle. It said that, generally, a software-defined vehicle requires a constant cellular connection (4G or 5G), a large, touch-enabled screen, and a powerful central compute system that is also connected to the vehicle\u2019s constituent components. Many SDVs also incorporate third-party apps and in-vehicle payments to add more features and convenience to drivers.\nIndeed, a visitor to the LVCC\u2019s recently built West Hall would have been struck by just how many of the leading automotive manufacturers were showing off their range of connected vehicles. BMW was right by the front door, and not far away on the CES parking lot were connected vehicles from the likes of Mercedes, Jeep, John Deere and Hyundai, surrounded by IT and communications leaders whose products were making these vehicles smarter and equipped for the forthcoming days of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks that will almost certainly be the basis for future driving experiences.\nCars and computers connect\nFox\u2019s Claman was there to set the scene for this brave new connected world, interviewing Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon to show exactly how IT leaders were engaging with automotive as a key market. Amon suggested CES was now \u201ca car show, among other things\u201d, with vehicles being a new space for computing.\nHe added that Qualcomm was undergoing a fundamental shift in how it sees itself, from a wireless communications company to being a connected processor and artificial intelligence (AI) company. The overarching strategy for the company going forward is to tap into the growing world of AI in local devices.\n\u201cWe have been very passionate about the role of AI in the devices we carry. We\u2019ve been talking about on-device [AI for a long time] and our job was [to make] a computing engine that is going to make that technology run pervasively \u2026 The next form of computing, which is accelerated computing for AI, is going to happen everywhere. There\u2019s fundamentally one thing that is different now. I look at [AI on devices] as the foundation of many of the things we\u2019re doing with the Snapdragon digital cockpit and some of the rapid success we have had in automotive.\u201d\nIn aiming to realise Amon\u2019s vision, Qualcomm used CES 2024 to launch a range of automotive products based on its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform\u202fto support next-generation digital cockpits, connected car technologies, connected services, advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems. Within the Snapdragon roadmap, Qualcomm said automakers were being equipped to meet the increasing needs for higher levels of safety and intelligence powered by LTE,\u202f5G, connected services,\u202fV2X, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite communications and precise positioning.\nIn addition to bringing AI forward within the automotive sphere, Qualcomm believes connectivity remains integral to the global industry\u2019s digital transformation, powering what Amon calls an \u201cunprecedented amount of innovation\u201d. A key example is embedding the Salesforce CRM solution within the Snapdragon Cockpit and trialling financial solutions so that digital payments can be made from a car and associated with individual drivers.\nIn an example of where its automotive technology is being deployed, Qualcomm has signed a deal with Robert Bosch to introduce a central vehicle computer capable of running infotainment and\u202fadvanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities\u202fon a single system-on-chip (SoC). Bosch\u2019s new central vehicle computer, known as the\u202fcockpit & ADAS integration platform, is based on the\u202fSnapdragon Ride Flex\u202fSoC. Together, the companies say they have successfully executed several in-vehicle infotainment projects and established a global customer base in this area.\nThe Bosch deal also highlights the fact that one of the key aspects of the connected vehicle marketplace is that is it dependent on a strong ecosystem, with partners from across the traditional automotive supply chain working in conjunction with the IT and comms industry.\nDigital twins for faster development\nMarelli is a mobility technology supplier to the automotive sector, whose stated mission is to transform the future of mobility through working with customers and partners to create a \u201csafer, greener and better-connected world\u201d.\nIts key products include automotive lighting and sensing, electronics systems, electric powertrains, green technology solutions and interior experiences. The latter comprises cockpit module assemblies and modules to manufacturers, from steering members to cockpits and consoles. As SDVs, powertrain evolution, advanced connectivity and autonomy are rapidly reshaping the needs, designs and architectures of next-generation vehicles, Marelli says its approach will be based on co-creating the future of mobility with its customers, suppliers and leading technology partners.\nThe company used CES 2024 to show the IT and comms partnerships it had to offer to automotive manufacturers \u2013 not just the in-car products it could support, but also the connected services that such vehicles could take advantage of to produce digital cockpits and infotainment systems. Its key partners include Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and BlackBerry QNX.\nThe firm stresses that complexity within vehicles is getting higher and higher, and the key to accelerated development of new products and services is the cloud.\nIn a demonstration at CES 2024, the firm showed a number of its connected vehicle options with its partners, in particular showing off the benefits of creating a digital twin of the digital cockpit using a Qualcomm generation four chip, BlackBerry QNX Hypervisor, and a cluster and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) applications running on top of that with a virtual version running on the cloud. The virtual setup comprised AWS cloud infrastructure, Qualcomm emulated hardware and QNX hypervisor.\nOffering a reason for using a digital twin, Marelli notes that a traditional automotive production development programme is very linear: you start with hardware, then you do software, then integration. Typically, it takes about three years, which Marelli says is just no longer an acceptable development timeline. With a digital twin, manufacturers can decouple hardware development from software developers and start developing in the cloud on virtualised hardware. And when the hardware is ready, manufacturers can take the software, put it on the hardware and continue integration and testing.\nMarelli estimates that this will reduce standard development timelines by up to 70% \u2013 from 36 months to 12-16 months \u2013 and reduce hardware costs by 30% because fewer physical hardware samples would be needed for development and testing. In the CES demo, Marelli created a digital twin for a zonal architecture, testing out the media player and other key functions within the cluster display.\nThe next big area of focus from a development perspective will be with microcontrollers, which still drive a lot of products in vehicles. A virtual product is expected at CES 2025.\nSupporting car connectivity\nThose of a certain age would have been hugely interested to see the return of BlackBerry to the comms market. Even after its meteoric fall after defining mobile business in the immediate post-millennial era, the company never went away. And while renaissance may not yet be the word to describe the company\u2019s overall status in the comms industry, at CES it was most certainly back with interesting solutions.\nAt the show, BlackBerry revealed the general availability of version 8.0 of its QNX Software Development Platform\u00a0(SDP) which is designed to deliver a scalable, high-performance, real-time operating system for the current embedded computing industry, offering particular support for next-generation automotive and IoT systems. It also announced that it is working with AWS on the creation of a virtual cockpit\u00a0platform for manufacturer Stellantis as part of its virtual engineering workbench, enabling the delivery of infotainment technology.\nAnother manufacturer BlackBerry is working with is Jeep, a user of its IVY mobility platform. Tarun Shome, product management director for BlackBerry IVY, revealed at CES 2024 that the company has been in the automotive industry for some time and currently provides secure access technology for over 235 million today.\nExplaining BlackBerry IVY\u2019s function, Shome reemphasised Qualcomm\u2019s Amon\u2019s point about the power of local devices. \u201cIt\u2019s a middleware platform that allows us to take signals from the vehicle and create rich insights from the vehicle edge. So rather than actually processing in the cloud, sending loads of connected vehicle data, we have the ability to use the compute power that we have within the vehicle to then provide insights on signals,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed it in conjunction with AWS, so as a partnership, and we then have some elements that allow us to control and configure everything from the code, and then to deploy software artefacts that run within our runtime on the vehicle to create these insights,\u201d Shome added.\nShome sees specific opportunities arising from being able to create meaningful insights from data that is created from within the vehicle. BlackBerry is also looking to offer business efficiencies. Shome believes the BlackBerry technology can help reduce connectivity costs for connected vehicles by 70% of the connectivity costs due to processing in the vehicle, and that around 97% of compute costs can be taken away for some of the use cases.\nIn addition to AWS, BlackBerry is working with a range of ecosystem partners for its system to be implemented by the likes of Jeep. Shome revealed specific examples: \u201cIf you look at the partnerships we have, we have companies that are providing driver monitoring systems, we have companies that are providing tyre wear predictions, running IVI by taking information from the wheels. We have insurance-based use cases to where you typically have a telematics black box that you can replace with a software component. We have a company that\u2019s looking at micro adjustments on your steering wheel and showing you [driver performance]. We have crash analysis by using the forward-facing cameras, and also sensors on the vehicle to detect crashes and create a report. We have facial recognition and offer [fleet managers] driver monitoring. What we want to do is to provide the tools to allow [manufacturers] to build out the use cases.\u201d\nFuture thinking\nWhile CES 2024 highlighted a whole host of technologies that could be implemented into automotive use cases, the one caveat is that the current infotainment innovations may not be hitting the road in commercially available vehicles for some time yet. Maybe not until 2028 or later. By this time, the industry will likely be seeing the first in a range of 6G connectivity services. So how far do technology firms need to be thinking ahead when it comes to connectivity?\nEnrico Salvatori, senior vice-president and president of Qualcomm Europe, noted that his company was very aware of the capabilities of the next generation of mobile, working with other players in the market to set \u201centry procedures\u201d and set their specifications requirements. Yet he stressed there was plenty more that could be done in terms of 5G.\n\u201c[6G] is one effort ongoing, even though in the initial phase. There are still a lot of big R&D efforts in the development of 5G, so there is still a lot of work to be done on 5G for us, in particular in terms of implementing the modem, the chipset, the new performance. [In that], there is a gain. We think edge AI will see a huge effort in R&D driving the future and we are already there, but there will be more to come.\n\u201cBecause this is automotive, you will see more and more SDV needs. You need to have a central compute platform with high performance. And then by software, you define the connected car \u2013 is it an entry-level or mid-range model? And with the software, we can do over-the-air updates. And because of 5G, it will drive the evolution of performance. With AI, everything is done by software, but we need to go to work on hardware to be ready to support the additional software performance requested in the future.\u201d\nAnd as CES 2024 showed, for \u201cadditional\u201d, read \u201chuge\u201d. Past CES events have tended to leave visitors wondering whether what they saw will ever be commercialised. It\u2019s doubtful this will be the case for what anyone saw at CES 2024 in the automotive space.

Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation.
