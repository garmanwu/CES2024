        "raw_content": "Apex Storage X21 AIC Features 21 M.2 Gen 4 Slots, 100 PCIe Lanes, Up To 168 TB Per Card\nA new hardware vendor known as Apex Storage is offering a brand new AIC known as the X21 which seemingly supports 21 Gen 4 M.2 SSDs.\nHardware Vendor Showcases PCIe Gen 4 AIC With Support For 21 M.2 SSDs, 100 PCIe Lanes & 168 TB Capacities Per Card\nApex Storage is a name that we haven't heard of before and there are not many details provided on the webpage. The only product that the company has listed is its X21 AIC which is a very high-end product considering the feature that it is said to offer and the design is very interesting too.\nStarting with the specifications, the Apex Storage X21 AIC comes in a single-slot form factor that sandwiches two tall PCBs together. The two PCBs are connected via a PCIe interface while the AIC itself uses a full-length PCIe 4.0 x16 slot to connect to the motherboard. All four sides of the dual PCBs are littered with PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSD slots. There are 10 slots on the internal sides & 11 slots on the other sides of the PCB. There are two 6-pin connectors which along with the PCIe interface delivers around 225W of power to the components.\nHow Apex Storage X21 AIC achieves support for 21 PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSDs could be by using several PLX controllers which are situated underneath the large heatsink in the middle of the PCB. There are no pictures of the PLX hubs but the feature lists state that it supports 100 PCIe Lanes with 168 TB+ capacities per AIC (using 8 TB Gen 4 M.2 SSDs), up to 31 GB/s Read/Write speeds, and over 10 Million+ IOPS.\nThe Apex Storage X21 AIC is a passive-cooled design but requires around 400 LFM of airflow at the minimum for stable operation. The whole thing weighs 19 oz but that will change when it will be loaded with 21 Gen 4 M.2 SSDs. There's no pricing or availability mentioned and we aren't sure if the product is just a prototype or a retail variant. Take the listing with a grain of salt but if real, this could be a cool product for storage enthusiasts.\nDeal of the Day\nFurther Reading\nComments\nTrending Stories\nPopular Discussions\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "Apex Storage X21 Review: The Roaring Twenty-Ones\nThe Apex Storage X21 brings top-tier performance and capacity to enterprise and prosumer use cases with 21 Gen4 NVMe \u00a0M.2 SSDs on a double-width PCIe add-in card (FHFL). In total, the X21 can provide 168TB of storage per card (8TB SSDs) and cranks out up to 31GB/s read speeds and over 10 million IOPS.\nThe Apex Storage X21 brings top-tier performance and capacity to enterprise and prosumer use cases with 21 Gen4 NVMe \u00a0M.2 SSDs on a double-width PCIe add-in card (FHFL). In total, the X21 can provide 168TB of storage per card (8TB SSDs) and cranks out up to 31GB/s read speeds and over 10 million IOPS.\nApex Storage X21 Overview\nThe X21 features plug-and-play compatibility and supports UEFI and Secure Boot. It offers enterprise-grade reliability with advanced ECC and data protection, as well as advanced error recovery. Its low overhead architecture allows for no host CPU or DRAM offload, and it also supports software or OS RAID for data protection. Drivers are pre-compiled in Windows and Linux, so deployment is simple (but faster on Linux), and the card works with VMware ESXi.\nDriving this feature set and the overall performance is the Microchip 100 lane Gen4 PM40100 Fanout PCIe Switch. The chip has a TDP of 25 watts, meaning that the controller will stay cool with light airflow thanks to the included heatsink. That said, the SSDs may need a little extra airflow, which will depend on the drives and the enclosure the card is going in. It should also be noted that while space is tight, there is room for a 4mm heatsink to be added to the SSDs if needed. Apex also has a little design wiggle room. For custom applications, they can adjust the width of the card via the interconnect PCB.\nThe materials of the card also make a difference. Apex lists the Storage X21 as made from Thunderclad 3+ material. What is it? Well Thunderclad or TU-933+, which, at the time of specification, is the highest quality PCB material available. While lower-loss materials have emerged during the card\u2019s development, they claim it has helped the X21 continue to provide exceptional performance. While we don\u2019t have a test for such a thing, it\u2019s an interesting side note that we\u2019re not usually made aware of.\nApex Storage is targeting a few obvious use cases with the card; most clearly, the X21 fits the needs of data scientists and creative pros who want the fastest possible local storage. Apex points out they feel the X21 is appropriate for a number of enterprise use cases, like HCI. Unfortunately, enterprise SSD vendors have pulled back on M.2 development, opting for EDSFF drives instead. While there may be quite a few spots in the data center where the X21 fits, we\u2019re thinking at the moment it\u2019s a little more of a point solution.\nAt the same time, let\u2019s not dismiss the card\u2019s capabilities. The X21 absolutely flies, aggregating the performance of 21 SSDs. As we\u2019ll see in our performance results below, Apex\u2019s spec sheet claims are reasonable. And we\u2019re not even using the best drives available. While the 980 Pros used in this review are certainly capable, for the absolute best performance, there\u2019s even more potential on the table. And should a single card not meet your performance goals, Apex has validated that four cards with 84 drives works just fine. In the right system, a user could conceivably aggregate 8 of these cards in a server with a whopping 168 SSDs.\nOur emphasis is clearly on the storage capabilities this time around, but the X21 is more than just a one-trick pony. The M.2 slot supports a number of other devices. For instance, you could use wireless cards with M.2 A+E converter boards to set each wireless card to a specific wireless channel for spectrum monitoring. There\u2019s even an AI angle here. A company called Axelera makes an M.2 AI Edge accelerator module that could be used by the Apex card at some point as well.\nThe X21 sells for $2800 as a single unit, with volume pricing and custom orders available.\nApex Storage X21 Specifications\nApex Storage X21 Performance\nDespite the Apex Storage X21\u2019s remarkable capabilities, it\u2019s important to note the challenges we faced regarding system compatibility. To properly boot and benchmark the card, we found ourselves resorting to a consumer platform, as the X21 encountered difficulties when integrated with enterprise servers and workstations in our lab.\nThis limitation may restrict the card\u2019s adaptability for some users and could potentially hinder its seamless integration into a variety of configurations. It\u2019s crucial for prospective buyers to thoroughly assess their system compatibility before investing in the X21 to ensure a smooth and efficient deployment of this powerful storage solution.\nTo leverage this card, the bare minimum requirement is a dual-slot opening, a x16 PCIe slot, and a 6-pin power feed. For a consumer workstation, this is the same requirement as a traditional full-size GPU, and most desktops will have the space and power availability.\nOn the server side, this gets more complicated. Traditional 1U and 2U servers are built to take advantage of more normal PCIe edge cards, primarily the common HHHL (half-height, half-length) card. Almost all of these draw power from the PCIe slot, so many servers don\u2019t ship with add-on power connectors. For both size and power, you\u2019d want to leverage a GPU-ready server with the appropriate size bays, airflow, and, most importantly, power availability.\nFor this review, we leveraged an AMD-based MSI X670E Motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 4.5GHz, 16-core CPU. This platform included 64GB of DDR5 memory and, for the duration of the review, leveraged integrated graphics only. We had tried using our Lenovo and Dell AMD ThreadRipper platforms but ran into issues getting the platforms to post. Our Intel-based consumer platform connected to the card in x8 instead of x16 mode, and the BIOS didn\u2019t include an option to set the PCIe width manually. The processor inside our rig also started to choke in the multi-million IOPS tests.\nVdbench Performance Tests\nTo kick the tires on the Apex Storage X21 with 21 Samsung 980 Pro 1TB SSDs, we used a Debian OS test environment with our Vdbench tests, as well as some Fio workloads. The Vdbench workloads provide some comparison to enterprise devices we\u2019ve reviewed over the years, while Fio supported the newer io_uring I/O protocol, which enables lower-latency, high-throughput testing.\nWhen it comes to benchmarking storage devices, application testing is best, and synthetic testing comes in second place. While not a perfect representation of actual workloads, synthetic tests do help to baseline storage devices with a repeatability factor that makes it easy to do apples-to-apples comparisons between competing solutions. These workloads offer a range of different testing profiles ranging from \u201cfour corners\u201d tests and common database transfer size tests to trace captures from different VDI environments.\nAll of these tests leverage the common vdBench workload generator, with a scripting engine to automate and capture results over a large compute testing cluster. This allows us to repeat the same workloads across a wide range of storage devices, including flash arrays and individual storage devices. Our testing process for these benchmarks fills the entire drive surface with data and then partitions a drive section equal to 5% of the drive capacity to simulate how the drive might respond to application workloads. This is different from full entropy tests, which use 100% of the drive and takes them into a steady state. As a result, these figures will reflect higher-sustained write speeds.\nProfiles:\nWhile the Dapustor R5100 and Apex Storage X21 don\u2019t quite compete head to head, we picked this drive as it was one of the fastest U.2 enterprise SSDs we\u2019ve tested recently. While the Dapustor R5100 topped out at nearly 1.8M IOPS, the Apex Storage X21 screamed past it, with much lower latency, coming in at just under 3M IOPS in this test.\nNext we look at 4K random write performance, where the Dapustore offered around 700k IOPS, while the X21 came in with 1.94M IOPS with the 21 Samsung 980 Pro SSDs.\nWhile 4K performance had a dramatic difference in the scale of performance, that\u2019s nothing compared to what you see looking at the drive bandwidth. The Apex Storage X21, besides a GPU, is one of the few devices that takes full advantage of every drop of PCIe potential, and it completely saturates the x16 Gen4 slot. In our 64K sequential workload, the X21 came in with an incredible 27.2GB/s, whereas the Dapustor measured 7.2GB/s.\n64K sequential write performance was equally as impressive, with the X21 coming in with 23.3GB/s while the Dapustor R5100 topped out at 2.8GB/s.\nNext, we look at our SQL Workload, in which the X21 offered a peak throughput of 3.46M IOPS or 27.1GB/s.\nIn our SQL 90-10 workload, the Apex Storage X21 measured 3.27M IOPS or 25.6GB/s.\nIn our SQL 80-20 workload with a higher write mixture, the X21 measured a peak throughput of 3.13M IOPS or 24.5GB/s.\nFinally, we look at VDI performance with our full-clone traces. In our VDI Initial Login test, the X21 came in with an impressive 1.01M IOPS or 19.2GB/s.\nIn our VDI Boot workload, the Apex Storage X21 measured 1.99M IOPS or 27.5GB/s, completely saturating the PCIe Gen4 slot.\nIn our last Vdbench workload covering VDI Monday Login, the X21 measured 919k IOPS or 20GB/s at its peak.\nWhile Vdbench covers one aspect of the drive\u2019s synthetic performance, we also included Fio results in this review as it can leverage the newer and more efficient io-uring I/O protocol. Here our focus is showing the absolute peak I/O and bandwidth possible through the card. Before each of these tests was performed, each SSD was formatted and then completely filled.\nOne interesting stat we wanted to mention is regarding the 512-byte random read performance. Before the SSDs were filled, they could push 23M IOPS at 11.8GB/s. While this was different from the true performance of these SSDs before getting completely filled with data, it does indicate the Apex Storage X21 is capable of passing far more traffic with faster SSDs.\nWe\u2019ve been told by the company that performance greater than 40M IOPS is possible. The main limit this card will hit is the PCIe Gen4 x16 slot cap, which will top out at around 28GB/s or so.\nApex Storage X21 Thermals\nWhen we first saw the Apex Storage X21 hit the news wire, our first thought was how fast will this drive burst into flames. With how much power is flowing through each of the 21 SSDs this card is capable of holding, thermal performance is no joke.\nThe Samsung 980 Pro SSD at peak load is capable of drawing almost 8.5W of power, which, with all of them combined, would be using nearly 180W on this card. All that power will turn to heat, and you need to shed it quickly before the drives or card gets throttled or damaged.\nTo safely test this card in our test rig, we leveraged a massive AC-powered fan positioned next to the motherboard for ample airflow. Apex lists the airflow requirements at 400LFM, which is well outside the realm of a normal desktop and even most workstations. That type of airflow is what you\u2019d commonly find in a server while it is operating at near full tilt in terms of fan speed.\nWe monitored the individual drive temperatures reported through SMART data during our full drive fill. This put each drive into its worst-case scenario of full write performance over an extended period of time. The temperatures were polled towards the end of this activity.\nThe safe operating range of the Samsung 980 Pro is listed at 0-70C, so at their peak load, the hottest drives did stay under that figure. Making sure the cooling is in check is an absolute requirement before putting one of these into service.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe Apex Storage X21 is a truly remarkable and groundbreaking piece of hardware that brings high performance and vast storage capacity to enterprise and prosumer environments. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations, such as the significant airflow requirements and heat generation, as it draws power comparable to a GPU without built-in cooling.\nDespite the installation and cooling challenges, with a proper setup and cooling solutions, the X21 has the potential to unlock unparalleled performance for various applications. The X21\u2019s impressive storage capabilities could play a crucial role in powering data-intensive applications that are popular in data science and creative professional workloads.\nIt\u2019s always a fun surprise when new devices come into our lab and completely breaks or saturates a system. The Apex Storage X21 did just that with its incredible performance capabilities. We could pull 28.3GB/s off the card in an 8K random read operation or push 28.7GB/s to it in an 8K random write workload. For small-block write in our 4K Fio test, this card topped out at 6.8M IOPS read and 5.3M IOPS write. Moving to a smaller blocksize, we started to hit the limits of the Samsung 980 Pro SSDs, which could push 23M IOPS in a 512-byte random read operation factory fresh but dropped down to 14.6M IOPS once the drives were filled. To hit these figures out of a single slot is incredible.\nThe X21 offers unparalleled performance to the point that this one component could be a productivity game-changer that a certain set of professionals are looking for. Our review unit is $4500 all in with the SSDs, which isn\u2019t that bad, considering the value it will provide to applications that need this level of performance. Again, the X21 needs a pretty prescriptive platform to work, but if you\u2019re willing to make that effort, you will not be disappointed with what this card brings to the table. In fact, you\u2019ll probably be downright giddy.\nProduct Page\nEngage with StorageReview\nNewsletter\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0| Podcast\u00a0iTunes/Spotify\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0TikTok\u00a0|\u00a0RSS Feed\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to the StorageReview newsletter to stay up to date on the latest news and reviews.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nPCIe 4.0 Card Hosts 21 M.2 SSDs: Up To 168TB, 31 GB/s\nThe Apex Storage X21 may be the ultimate AIC for M.2 storage.\nApex Storage, a newcomer to the storage game, has launched the X21, an AIC (add-in-card) that accommodates up to 21 PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs. With the X21, consumers can use the best SSDs to build configurations with capacities of up to 168TB and experience speeds up to 31 GBps.\nApex Storage has its headquarters in Utah and focuses on AIC products. Mike Spicer and Henry Hill appear to be the team behind Apex Storage. You may have heard of Spicer as he kickstarted the Storage Scaler expansion card in 2021 that houses up to 16 M.2 SATA drives. The X21, the only listed product on Apex Storage's website, seems to be the jacked-up version of the original Storage Scaler. But, strangely, Apex Storage opted for PCIe 4.0 on the X21 since PCIe 5.0 SSDs are already available on the retail market.\nThe X21 sticks to a double-width full-height full-length (FHFL) form factor with a single-slot PCI design. The AIC, which measures 274.2mm long, communicates through a standard PCIe 4.0 x16 expansion slot. It's backward compatible with PCIe 3.0, but performance will take a significant hit. Apex Storage essentially bonded two PCBs in a sandwich with the X21, which is why the AIC can handle up to 21 M.2 SSDs putting rival options like the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus Destroyer 2 to shame. The concept takes us on a trip down memory lane, for sure. If you're old enough, it's the same concept Nvidia used for the prehistoric GeForce 7900 GX2.\nThere are 10 PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots and a massive heatsink that covers the unspecified controller in the X21's interior. We suspect a PCIe switch is under the heatsink, likely making the X21 tick. The remaining 11 PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots are located on the exterior of the PCBs.\nGiven the vast number of SSDs the X21 can support, the AIC can't get all the power from the single expansion slot. Therefore, Apex Storage implemented two regular 6-pin PCIe power connectors to provide auxiliary power. This configuration allows for up to 225W. Although the X21 features a passive cooling design, the manufacturer does recommend a minimum airflow of 400 LFM for optimal operation.\nThe X21 photographs show the AIC with Samsung 990 Pro SSDs and the card only supports M.2 2280 drives. It also accepts Intel's Optane M.2 SSDs, like the H20; not like there are a lot of Optane drives floating around now that Intel has axed its Optane business. Apex Storage doesn't reveal the inner details of the X21. However, the manufacturer confirmed that the X21 offers 100 PCIe lanes, suggesting the presence of a PCIe switch.\nIn a single-card configuration, the X21 delivers sequential read and write speeds up to 30.5 GBps and 28.5 GBps, respectively. The random performance on the AIC consists of 7.5 million IOPS reads and 6.2 million IOPS writes. The X21 shines even more in a multi-card setup. According to Apex Storage, consumers can enjoy up to 107 GBps sequential reads and 80 GBps sequential writes. The random performance also gets a substantial boost. The X21 flaunts over 20 million IOPS reads and 10 million IOPS writes in a multi-card arrangement. The AIC has an average read and write access latency of 79us and 52us, respectively.\nWith 8TB SSDs, such as the Corsair MP400 or the Sabrent Rocket Q, the X21 can supply up to 168TB on a single card. It also supports higher-capacity drives. Once future 16TB M.2 SSDs hit the market, consumers can have up to 336TB of storage on the X21. Regarding the feature set, the X21 supports RAID configurations in Windows and Linux environments. However, Apex Storage didn't expose the type of RAID arrays. The X21 also flaunts \"enterprise-grade reliability,\" NVMe 2.0 support, advanced EEC, data protection, and error recovery.\nApex Storage didn't reveal the pricing or availability for the X21.\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

But we did notice some genuinely exciting things this year, including the one item almost all of us were talking about: a TV that becomes completely see-through.\nHere\u2019s more about that, and a baker\u2019s dozen other things that we\u2019re looking forward to in 2024:\nA TV you look through\nLG Transparent OLED (LG OLED T, LG OLED Signature T), later this year, price TBD\nLG\u2019s wireless, transparent OLED TV is a fantastical concept that few people will buy\u2014but everyone will want.\nUsing proprietary wireless video technology and some kind of pixel magic that LG didn\u2019t fully explain, the 77-inch 4K transparent OLED TV creates images that seem to float in space.\nFish appear to be swimming in midair. Snow appears to materialize in your living room. When turned off, the TV basically disappears.\nIt also has a rolling contrast screen that can slide up behind it to turn it into a traditional OLED TV.\nIt has no bezel, no wires, nowhere to plug anything in, and\u2014somehow\u2014no discernible heat signature (I reached behind the transparent display, and it was surprisingly cool).\nWhile there is a roughly 1-inch-thick screen suspended in the TV\u2019s housing frame, you can see right through to the wall behind it, though the glass still has a slight sepia tone. The transparent display creates a kind of faux 3D effect while you\u2019re watching, such that the images appear to occupy the full space between the wall at the rear and the front of the screen.\nThough AV fans may argue that the effect dispels traditional cinematic immersion, it\u2019s still an undeniably captivating spin on the usual TV-watching experience.\nLG has stated that the LG OLED T will be available to buy later this year, and though we\u2019ll love to see it show up in department stores and hotel lobbies, it\u2019s not likely to be priced for the average buyer\u2014unless you have tens of thousands to spare for a nearly invisible TV.\nA more comfortable heart-rate monitor\nGarmin HRM-Fit, available now, $150\nGarmin unveiled the HRM-Fit, which attempts to eliminate some of the long-standing discomfort associated with wearing a heart-rate monitor.\nIn the demos we saw, the HRM-Fit clipped to a sports bra, negating the need to wear a band across the entire chest, which we\u2019ve noticed sometimes leads to chafing or irritation with other monitors.\nAside from heart rate, the monitor also tracks steps and calories burned, as well as feedback on your running strides (through the Garmin Connect app). Garmin advertises the HRM-Fit as having a one-year battery life.\nA smart gadget for good boys\nPawport, May 2024, from $450\nThe smart home was ubiquitous at CES, with internet-connected models of nearly any device imaginable on display.\nTopping my list of favorites was the Pawport, a smart pet door that opens and closes automatically when your pet approaches.\nWhat is so appealing to me (note, I don\u2019t even have a pet and am still unreasonably thrilled by this thing) is how thoughtfully the software and hardware were designed. The result is the essence of what makes a \u201csmart\u201d device desirable.\nThe Pawport consists of a pair of powered aluminum doors connected by steel hinges to a steel frame. You screw the frame around an existing pet door and then slide the Pawport down over the frame.\nAround the inside of the doors is rubber weatherstripping that compresses when the doors close to form an airtight seal. The doors are either insulated or have rechargeable, slide-in batteries that last several months between charges.\nOn top is a suite of intuitive touch controls, including open, close, lock, and power.\nThe companion to the doors is a collar fob with a rechargeable battery that sends a Bluetooth signal to the Pawport so that it opens when the pet approaches from inside or outside. It\u2019s also smart enough not to open the door if your pup decides to lie down within range of the door.\nThe Pawport is due in May and will be sold in a range of sizes and finishes\u2014that\u2019s plenty of time for me to convince my wife that a dog is the thing our family is really missing.\nSecurity over the longer range\nAbode Edge Camera, later this year, $200\nOutdoor security cameras should help give you peace of mind, but if Wi-Fi connection issues plague your outdoor cameras, you\u2019ll find no peace.\nAbode\u2019s new answer to that problem\u2014the Abode Edge Camera\u2014replaces traditional Wi-Fi with HaLow wireless technology, which gives it a range of almost 1.5 miles.\nIn addition to long range, HaLow is good at penetrating structures, making this camera suitable for outdoor use while the unit\u2019s wireless hub, which connects to your main network, sits safely indoors.\nThe weatherproof camera includes a 6,000 mAh rechargeable battery, which the company says will power the camera for up to a year.\nThe camera can integrate with Abode\u2019s security systems, including the one we reviewed.\nOther security camera companies have tackled the long-distance Wi-Fi problem by skipping it altogether and including 4G LTE connections in their cameras, but those models require an expensive subscription fee through carriers such as T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAbode\u2019s Edge camera is expected to sell for $200 and requires just a $4-per-month service plan for cloud video storage.\nSimple, (almost) instant smoking\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, available now, $1,000\nAt CES I saw more grills, smokers, and meat thermometers than in my local Home Depot, but the standout was the countertop GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker.\nSmoking adds distinct flavor to all kinds of foods, but it\u2019s typically done over lower temperatures for long hours, requiring the cook to camp out in the backyard by a hot black metal bin to feed the fire and actively manage the smoke and the temperature. To do it well, in other words, you need passion, time, and skill.\nIf the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works as billed\u2014the company says you can set it to specific recipes and let it do the work, or you can independently control the heat or smoke level\u2014it can effectively turn smoking into a readily accessible cooking technique for anyone who wants it, just like air frying or sous vide. Imagine popping a few eggplants into a microwave-sized appliance to make killer homemade baba ghanouj on a weeknight, or smoking your own spice blends or chiles whenever the mood strikes.\nI got a sneak peek at this cooker late last year on a research trip to the GE Appliances manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where I got to sample some perfectly prepared wings hot out of the box\u2014tender, smoky, sweet, and moist.\nA few more important details: The smoker uses the same pellets as traditional pellet smokers do. It fits 40 wings, a brisket cut in half, or a whole chicken, and it has the same technology to keep the smoke safely inside the appliance and out of your home as the hearth oven made by Monogram, GE Appliances\u2019s luxury brand.\nA simple pocket drone for action selfies\nHoverAir X1, available now, from $350\nDJI has had a death grip on the hobby drone market for the past few years, and for good reason. The image quality, control systems, and autonomous flight modes on the brand\u2019s drones have excelled in our testing, and DJI\u2019s lineup satisfies almost every budget and need.\nThat\u2019s why I was excited to find a tiny, cheap, and potentially uniquely usable drone made by a different company at this year\u2019s CES.\nThe HoverAir X1 is a 4.4-ounce, foldable drone that aims to enable people to capture quick and easy close-up footage. It lacks a dedicated controller, instead focusing on autonomous flight modes and subject-tracking software to follow activities.\nWe\u2019ll be testing this drone against our picks to see if this $350 model ($400 with two extra batteries) can compete with the much more expensive and versatile DJI Mini Pro series. While we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll replace the more expensive cinematic drones, it may be a useful and relatively affordable tool for folks looking to capture simple follow-along footage.\nWash and dry in one laundry machine\nGE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer, available now, $2,900\nIn the future, will a combo washer/dryer actually dry your clothes?\nCombo washer/dryers were plentiful at CES this year, and we found the GE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer to be the most intriguing.\nTwo-in-one laundry machines aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re generally less popular. These machines are heat-pump dryers, which use a closed-loop heat system (no vents) to dry clothes at a lower temperature. In practice that has made them less effective at drying clothes.\nDeveloping the UltraFast Combo required years of GE research into heat-pump dryers, which has resulted in patented technology meant to boost the drying process. If this new approach substantially improves drying performance, it could be the beginning of a major change for laundry appliances.\nA ventless machine that requires less space and less time to operate could transform how people do laundry. Even better: Heat-pump dryers use substantially less energy than traditional dryers, and these home appliances qualify for home energy rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ll be testing this combo washer/dryer, along with several others, later in the year.\nIn-ear translation and out-of-ear sound\nVasco Translator E1, June 2024, $390\nVasco has put its impressive handheld live translator into an earbud format. The Vasco Translator E1 earpiece translates nearly 50 languages in real time (though it still needs to be connected to an app on your phone).\nAnd if the final product works like the demo, its performance will be impressive.\nVasco spent a lot of time working with linguists to address idioms and variations in meaning that direct word-for-word translations don\u2019t consider, which can be crucial to understanding someone in business settings, at medical appointments, or when you\u2019re speaking with local police. The translated text is visible in the app and spoken through the earpiece.\nMagSafe-like wireless charging for Android phones\nBaseus Qi2 Magpro Magnetic Wireless Charging Car Mount, early 2024, price TBD\nBig advancements in charging technology are rare, but a new development in this sphere was hard to miss at this year\u2019s CES: Qi2 (pronounced \u201cchee two\u201d) wireless charging.\nLike Apple\u2019s MagSafe, Qi2 uses rings of magnets to ensure easy alignment between phone and charger, and it allows any compatible device to charge at up to 15 W\u2014twice as fast as the original Qi spec could deliver. Even better, it isn\u2019t proprietary to Apple, so any device that rolls out with a Qi2 certification going forward (maybe the next Pixel?) will be able to take advantage of its faster charging speeds and sturdy magnetic connection.\nOf all the Qi2 chargers we saw on the showroom floor this week\u2014and there were many, from well-known brands like Anker, ESR, and Hyper\u2014we\u2019re most excited about a wireless-charging car mount from Baseus (set to launch in early 2024). Not only does it support Qi2\u2019s 15 W charging speeds, but it also has a small built-in fan to help your phone stay cool. This is handy since wireless chargers in general are prone to overheating, which can damage your device\u2019s battery over time.\nTurntable music that doesn\u2019t have to stop\nVictrola Automatic Turntable, later this year, $200\nWhile some vinyl enthusiasts want turntables that let them tweak every aspect, others, especially those new to the hobby, want something that doesn\u2019t require so much homework\u2014or money.\nThe Victrola Automatic is the latter kind.\nAs a fully automatic turntable, it lowers the tonearm to begin play and raises it at the end. Just place your record down and hit the play button. Victrola also introduced a repeat mode that automatically moves the stylus back to the beginning of the record and plays it again (and again), a useful feature if you\u2019re spinning a favorite.\nThe Victrola Automatic can connect to wired or wireless speakers and includes RCA outputs with a switchable preamp, plus Bluetooth to stream to a pair of wireless speakers, such as the Edifier S1000MKII, our pick for the best powered speakers with Bluetooth.\nComputer monitors go OLED\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM Monitor, later this year, price TBD\nPC monitors are getting bigger, brighter, and equipped with far more contrast than ever before.\nNearly every PC vendor announced a new 4K OLED monitor at CES, so we expect a lot of competition for our best 4K monitor guide this year.\nMost LCD monitors you\u2019ve seen have a backlight that shines through the TV\u2019s picture, illuminating it to be visible. In OLED technology, each one of the screen\u2019s pixels illuminates itself and can individually turn on or turn off for the most pure black tones.\nFor gamers, this year\u2019s OLED displays are especially eye-catching. The LG UltraGear 32GS95UE, for instance, can switch what\u2019s on the display at 240 Hz, or 240 times per second. That higher refresh rate makes animations and motion on the screen seem more crisp and real. And the 32GS95UE can even boost the refresh rate to a staggering 480 Hz, if it knocks its 4K resolution down to 1080p. For everybody else, OLEDs offer fantastic color accuracy and nearly infinite contrast.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for that LG monitor, as well as Asus\u2019s ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which supports the DolbyVision HDR format.\nAI comes to your laptop\nVarious laptops from many brands, later this year, prices vary\nMicrosoft has dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of the AI PC.\u201d\nThe addition of the flashy new Copilot shortcut key allows even quicker access to your PC\u2019s AI capabilities. It also marks the first major change to the Windows keyboard in nearly three decades.\nBut the more significant change is under the hood. This year\u2019s newest PCs with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors have NPUs, or neural processing units, that run machine-learning processes locally. As a result, these tasks can run faster, can use less battery life, and can be more secure than sending them off to the cloud.\nSome notable examples of laptops with these processors include new versions of our top ultrabook picks that are available now\u2014the HP Spectre x360 14, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405), and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12\u2014as well as a fleet of other premium laptops shipping in the coming months.\nRight now, AI PC features are limited\u2014the prime example is Windows Studio effects, which use AI for video-conferencing features such as background blur and noise cancellation. But now that NPUs are available in a big way from Intel and AMD, many laptop and software companies are building apps and features that take advantage of them.\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to use a conversational interface for navigating and changing settings on your PC without having to dig through labyrinthine menus, or ask for a summary of a meeting transcript. We expect to see these AI PC features evolve over the coming years.\nPC gaming handhelds are here to stay, and Intel is getting involved\nMSI Claw A1M, later this year, price TBD\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since Valve and AMD brought handheld PC gaming to the masses with the Linux-based Steam Deck, and 2023 saw Asus and Lenovo join in with the Windows-based ROG Ally Extreme and Legion Go, respectively.\nBut MSI\u2019s new partnership with Intel for its upcoming Claw gaming handheld\u2014announced at CES and featuring a Meteor Lake\u2013based system-on-a-chip\u2014is the clearest indication yet that the major players in PC gaming are taking these devices more seriously than ever.\nMSI\u2019s Claw borrows heavily from the ROG Ally Extreme. It has a similar form, down to the programmable buttons on the back of each side grip and the function buttons on either side of its 1080p, variable-refresh-rate display. But the differences are obvious as well.\nThe rear of the Claw features a heavily vented design that MSI claims will help with heat dissipation, and MSI has stressed that the included 53 Wh battery should give two hours of battery life on its maximum performance settings, beating out the ROG Ally Extreme and even Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go.\nMSI will still have its work cut out for it against bigger players, and we have good reason to wonder how Intel\u2019s new hardware will fare compared with AMD\u2019s more mature graphics tech. We don\u2019t know how much effective battery life the Claw will have in real-world scenarios, or how easily it will manage different power profiles.\nAt CES, MSI was using October\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage to demonstrate the Claw\u2019s capabilities, but it wasn\u2019t running especially well, and the system-management software was sluggish and poorly organized.\nThe Claw is likely a couple of months away still, and every one of these mainstream gaming handhelds has launched in rough shape\u2014it was months before the ROG Ally Extreme felt stable, the Legion Go is still a work in progress, and the recent Steam Deck OLED model has seen dozens of beta updates since its November launch. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Claw comes together in February or March.\nRegardless, Intel\u2019s entry into the market is a clear indication that it thinks the demand for this kind of device is only going to grow, and after spending time with all of them, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nFaceTime calls made easy\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, later this year, $180\nBelkin\u2019s newest device is a motorized, auto-tracking iPhone dock that enables your phone camera to follow your face\u2014not only around the frame, but 360 degrees around. What this means: FaceTime calls and video recordings can follow you totally hands-free.\nBecause the dock uses Apple\u2019s DockKit API, you don\u2019t have to install an app to set it up. Pairing the dock with your iPhone takes seconds\u2014and the tracking is really good.\nOnce you place your iPhone on the dock\u2019s base, the Stand Pro instantly connects to it via NFC (near-field communication, the same technology that lets you make contactless mobile payments), and it uses Bluetooth to maintain its connection.\nYou can\u00a0activate or deactivate the tracking with the push of a single button, and the stand comes equipped with a screw port in case you want to attach it to a tripod, too. The Stand Pro also charges your iPhone via 15 W MagSafe charging, and the dock itself offers five-hour battery life when unplugged. We were impressed by the demo and can\u2019t wait to test the dock once it\u2019s available.\nThis article was edited by Jason Chen and Ben Frumin.\nMeet your guide\nWirecutter Staff\nFurther reading\nThe Best of CES 2022: What We\u2019re Most Looking Forward To\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter\u2019s expert staff found a few things to look forward to from CES 2022, including a smarter faucet and a projector that doubles as a portable speaker.\nThe Best Electric Vehicle Chargers for Home\nby Sarah Witman\nAfter 28 hours of research and 85 hours of testing, we found the best ways to charge your J1772 (non-Tesla) or Tesla electric vehicle at home.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking Forward To From CES 2019\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter reporters and editors spent three days working overtime at CES 2019 to find the new stuff that might actually improve your life this year.\nThe Best of CES 2023: What We\u2019re Looking Forward to Most\nby Wirecutter Staff\nA smarter water faucet, an excellent wireless speaker, and a cleaning genie were among our favorite things from CES 2023.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
