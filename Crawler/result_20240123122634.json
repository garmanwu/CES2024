        "raw_content": "Watch LG's CES 2024 keynote highlights in 10 minutes\nHighlights include the company's first transparent OLED TV, an ultra-fast gaming display and an 4K projector.\nLG has been trickling out news about its latest product drops for weeks before CES 2024 officially kicked off, with highlights that include a wireless transparent OLED TV, an ultra portable 4K projector and a friendly looking two-legged robot that can roam your house and watch your pets.\nThe 77-inch signature OLED T has turned heads with its unique \"transparent\" look and wireless audio and video capabilities. It's also powered by a processor that improves overall display performance and visuals by 70 percent compared to the previous-gen chip, according to LG. Its OLED TV lineup is also getting bigger with the expected launch of the LG Signature OLED M4 and OLED G4 TVs. Both have Alpha 11 AI processor chips embedded in their design, which are meant to improve their image quality. The AI chips promise to reduce visual blurring and improve color contrasts.\nThere are some other big developments worth getting excited about in its display offerings \u2014 but in the gaming sphere. LG also announced a 27-inch QHD OLED gaming display with an extremely fast 480Hz refresh rate.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nAbout Will Greenwald\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them.

Powered by the company\u2019s latest AI processor with 4-fold higher AI performance, these new additions to the OLED lineup deliver unparalleled viewing experiences with even more vibrant, lifelike picture quality.\nDriven by a customer-centric approach, LG\u2019s \u201cSync to You, Open to All\u201d vision expresses the company\u2019s aim to create personalized experiences for every lifestyle, with products that are accessible to all. To this end, LG\u2019s webOS smart TV platform provides tailored solutions and services with an expanded ecosystem featuring extended connectivity, offering unique encounters as a media and entertainment platform company to provide the ultimate TV experience for all.\nLG is introducing the all-new and expanded OLED TV lineup for 2024 with a cutting-edge AI-powered processor; developed by LG, exclusively designed for OLED TVs. Notably the LG SIGNATURE OLED M4 and LG OLED G4 TVs are equipped with the new \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor, which effectively enhances picture and audio quality. This provides a 70 percent improvement in graphic performance and a 30 percent faster processing speed compared to its predecessor.\nLG\u2019s newest OLED TVs come with upgraded AI upscaling utilizing precise pixel-level image analysis, to effectively sharpen objects and backgrounds that may appear blurry. All driven by the discerning judgment of the AI itself, the company\u2019s OLED TVs deliver a more clear and vibrant viewing experience. Moreover, the ingenious AI processor adeptly refines colors by analyzing frequently used shades that best convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers and content creators. Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro splits pictures into blocks and fine-tunes brightness and contrast by analyzing variations in brightness where light enters the scene, creating images that look more three-dimensional.\nThis all culminates with the LG SIGNATURE OLED M4, LG\u2019s wireless OLED TV. Now available in a new 65-inch screen size, allowing for a diverse range of screen options. From the versatile 65-inch model to the 97-inch giant, cleaner and distraction-free viewing is easily attainable. The innovative wireless Zero Connect Box completely eliminates all connected cables. The OLED M4 is the world\u2019s first TV with wireless video and audio transmission at up to 4K 144Hz, delivering superior OLED performance with accurate details and an elevated sense of immersion.\n\u201cBolstered by a class-leading OLED TV and impressive QNED lineup, LG continues to assert its dominance in the premium TV market with the promise of the best possible customer experience through a distinguished selection of content and services available on the company\u2019s webOS smart TV platform,\u201d said Park Hyoung-sei, president of the LG Home Entertainment Company.\nBesides offering impressive picture quality, AI Sound Pro offers richer and fuller audio while leveraging the built-in speakers\u2019 virtual 11.1.2 surround sound to build the perfect viewing environment. AI technology also effectively separates vocals from soundtrack to enhance the clarity of dialogue, and seamlessly elevates the audio as if it were emanating naturally from the center of its screen.\nLG\u2019s latest OLED evo models gain further credibility for their razor-sharp picture quality with the Video Electronics Standards Association\u2019s (VESA) ClearMR certification.1\nLG OLED TV\u2019s reputation as the ultimate gaming TV is secure with the latest models featuring several gaming advantages including an impressive 4K 144Hz refresh rate2 and comprehensive HDMI 2.1 features.

LG\u2019s latest smart TVs can even recognize users\u2019 voices based on profiles and offer personalized recommendations by interpreting patterns from comprehensive usage history.\nBased on individual profiles, users can customize the Home screen in the latest webOS smart TV platform and set up their personalized settings with minimal effort. This allows them to access their favorite services and content effortlessly and benefit from a personalized Picture Wizard, a service that lets them adjust image quality to their liking. Making the user experience even more seamless, the Home screen\u2019s user-friendly interface provides a preview of their most recently watched content, which means they can easily access information about recently used apps and play videos promptly and effortlessly.\nWith the webOS Re:New program,3 LG is offering the latest webOS upgrade to existing LG Smart TV owners to give them an up-to-date TV experience for the next five years. This upgrade applies to the company\u2019s 2022 OLED TV models and 2022 QNED Mini LED 8K models, and in the future, will be extended to more LG TV products worldwide as well, enabling the customers who purchase these LG TVs to benefit from distinctive user experiences thanks to the continuous five-year webOS upgrade.\nLG is committed to delivering the best user experiences to everyone by enhancing the accessibility of its products and facilitating seamless experiences across multiple devices.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly.

At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December.

Under the theme of \"Reinvent your future,\" LG's exhibition presents how the company will elevate customer experiences in everyday lives through its latest innovations \u2013 including the transparent and wireless 4K LG SIGNATURE OLED TV; a smart home powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies; and the mobility concept Alpha-able.\nThe Ultimate TV Experience With Innovative Technology and Infinite ContentThe heart of LG's booth is the world's first transparent and wireless 4K OLED TV, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T. Visitors are greeted by a massive media art display created by combining fifteen 77-inch OLED Ts, showcasing captivating video content with perfect black levels and vibrant colors. These displays gradually transform into a transparent OLED TV, revealing a new era uncovered by OLED T. The floating appearance of the OLED TVs emphasizes the wireless transmission of video and audio signals and connection to external devices, simplifying installation and providing more freedom in interior design.\nA dedicated zone highlights the LG SIGNATURE OLED T's transparent and wireless technology, which allows the TV to exceed the constraints of space and seamlessly blend into everyday life. Serving as a TV that complements the interior design of any space, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers an extension of future living experiences. Additionally, the transparent screen enhances the viewing experience of media artworks by adding depth and dimensionality.\nMoving on to the next zone, visitors encounter an impressive tunnel structure featuring over 140 55-inch OLED displays. This webOS experience Zone serves as a platform to showcase an extensive range of content, curated through collaborations with diverse partners. An invitation to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS platform, the webOS Zone treats guests to an extensive collection of video clips from a diverse range of genres, including highly anticipated series, games or sports. This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the 'Smart Life Solution' ExperienceIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company's AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people's lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers' words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers' heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend's presence, automatically asking whether to download the 'pet mode' on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers' daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG's Future Mobility ConceptGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \"personalized digital cave.\" To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG's mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG's unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers' needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG's EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG VisionLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company's experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG's home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its 'Universal UP Kit', a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG's latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "CES\n2024: LG's Massive OLED TV Ditches Wires and Incorporates (What Else?) AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nAbout Will Greenwald\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them.

These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

Held in Las Vegas every January, the Consumer Electronics Show is where thousands of technology brands showcase their latest innovations. Last year saw roughly 2400 exhibitors in attendance, including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nWhat Hi-Fi? has been in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the TV, AV and audio news from the desert, plus a host of first looks, hands-on reviews and initial impressions of the latest and greatest kit on display from the show floor.\nCES traditionally gives us a first glimpse at the products that will launch in the coming year and beyond, and this week we have already been flooded with information about the latest TV technologies and models coming from LG, Samsung, TCL and Panasonic. We've even managed to go hands-on with some of these new sets - see below for our first impressions.\nAudio and hi-fi announcements also make up the headlines, with Sennheiser, JBL and Audio Pro revealing new headphones and speakers, FiiO launching a surprise \u00a0Walkman-inspired cassette player, and Sonus Faber revealing its most ambitious speakers to date. We've also gathered together our CES highlights, our opinions (and even some disappointments) to give a full overview of this year's show.\nYou can read about all the news, highlights and hands-on from CES 2024 below...\nBest of CES 2024\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week From transparent TVs and a mega high-end speaker system to a wireless turntable and even a portable cassette player, it's been quite a CES. We pick our favourite products announced at the biggest tech show in the world. See our best CES 2024 products overall\n9 most exciting hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nAlthough the TV and AV announcements coming out of the show may have stolen a fair bit of the limelight, there have still been some great hi-fi and audio launches to get us talking, showing there is plenty of life in the old trade show yet for us audiophiles. See the best CES 2024 hi-fi announcements\nRolling laser TVs, dinky OLEDs and more: the 7 best home cinema reveals at CES 2024 It was a big CES for fans of TV and home cinema. We've seen everything from cutting-edge transparent TVs to affordable Dolby Atmos wireless systems make their debut on the tradeshow floor, along with the world's first 8K wireless projector. See the best CES 2024 home cinema announcements\nCES 2024: hands-on reviews & opinions\nLG G4 OLED TV hands-on review Brief demo sessions suggest that the new G4 is more of an upgrade than perhaps expected. Within the familiar chassis and spec sheet hide several subtle upgrades that together seem more meaningful than they may initially seem... Read our full LG G4 hands-on review\nPanasonic Z95A flagship OLED TV hands-on review Panasonic's flagship Z95A for 2024 seems very similar to the wonderful\u00a0MZ2000 it replaces but adds some neat upgrades, including a second-gen\u00a0MLA\u00a0OLED panel that, together with upgraded processing and a new heat management system, results in brighter picture performance. Read our full Panasonic Z95A hands-on review\nSamsung QN900D flagship 8K TV hands-on review Just how smart can a TV get? Well, if you believe what several major brands are saying at CES 2024, flatscreen IQs are set to go up a level this year thanks to \u2013 yep, you guessed it \u2013 AI processing. And nobody has made this message clearer than Samsung. Its top-tier TV for 2024 uses a new processing chip designed to deliver a wide range of AI enhancements to take \u201c picture and sound quality to a whole new level\u201d. Read our full Samsung QN900D hands-on review\nI've seen the 115-inch TCL Mini LED TV in action and now I want it\nI've been watching this rise of massive TVs with keen interest, and when TCL announced the most massive Mini LED TV yet at\u00a0CES 2024, I just had to go and check it out for myself. Let's just say I wasn't disappointed \u2013 at least not until I was told the price. Read the full TCL Mini LED TV opinion\nI saw Fiio\u2019s cassette player at CES 2024 and it had me feeling warm, fuzzy and frustrated\nI\u2019ve just spent the past six days navigating my way through all manner of high-tech kit at CES 2024, but it's the CP13 cassette player that put the biggest smile on my face. Walking up to it, I immediately had a couple of flashbacks to my childhood, spending an unhealthy amount of time with my old Sony Walkman. Is this an excuse to dust off your tape collection? Read the full Fiio CP13 cassette player opinion\nSamsung's new duo of small OLED TVs could spell trouble for LG \u2013 here's why Samsung has announced a new 42-inch TV and a 48-inch TV as part of its new lineup, which is easily one of the most interesting news out of CES 2024 in my eyes, and for one good reason. Put simply, it should teach LG that it can't rest on its laurels with the C-series any more. Read the full Samsung small OLED opinion\nForget transparent TVs \u2013 CES 2024 should have been about cheap OLEDs\nI applaud LG and Samsung\u2019s ambition, but I\u2019d rather see both focus on making TVs more affordable, especially during a cost-of-living crisis. I can\u2019t help but wish the companies had paid a little more time, attention and effort to helping bring OLED display tech, and top-end TV experiences in general, to more affordable prices. Read the full transparent TV opinion\nJBL revealed plenty of Bluetooth speakers at CES 2024 - but there's one glaring omission\nJBL announced a trio of Auracast-enabled Bluetooth speakers \u2013 the miniature Clip 5, the even dinkier Go 4 and the much-anticipated, very powerful,\u00a0Xtreme 4 \u2013 but where's the Flip 7? A successor to the current, excellent five-star\u00a0Flip 6 is what I'm pining for, as it could have the potential to be one of the best new portable speakers. Read the full JBL Flip 7 opinion\nTCL and Hisense may have fixed my biggest gripe with 100-inch TVs\nThere's something notable that differentiates TCL and Hisense from LG and Samsung where large-screen efforts are concerned. The former have created bespoke massive TVs while others have simply scaled up existing sets, and I certainly prefer one approach over the other... Read the full TCL and Hisense opinion\nCES 2024 proves Samsung and LG's best OLED TV tech isn\u2019t going down in price anytime soon\nWhile our team reporting from the showroom floor found plenty to get excited about with huge TVs and new OLED sets, one sad fact became increasingly apparent \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like the top-of-the-line MLA or QD-OLED panels seen on last year\u2019s flagships are going down in price any time soon. Read the full OLED TV tech opinion\nThe world is crying out for Samsung The Frame rivals \u2013 where's your imagination, Sony et al? Projectors are trying hard to adapt to modern-day whims, so why aren't your everyday TVs? Ever since Samsung's appealing, lifestyle-friendly The Frame TV was revealed, it's occupied this segment of the market in a way no other brand has? LG doesn\u2019t seem to really push its lifestyle sets, and Sony, Panasonic et al don\u2019t have any... but why not? Read the full Samsung The Frame opinion\nCES 2024 news: all the TV announcements\nHisense unveils Rollable Laser TV and 10,000-nit ULED X Hisense has unveiled its latest AV innovations at\u00a0CES 2024, with everything from 110-inch flagship TVs to exciting new ultra-short throw Laser TV models on show. The Chinese brand didn't show much of its standard television lineup for 2024, instead focusing on its more conceptual products... Read the full Hisense Rollable Laser TV and ULED X story\nFirst a transparent OLED TV comes to CES, and now a transparent Micro LED LG has been\u00a0showing off a transparent OLED display at trade shows\u00a0for a while now, though this week at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0it is proudly flaunting its most sophisticated and realised version yet, the\u00a0Signature OLED T (more below). And here we have our first sniff of a transparent Micro LED, courtesy of Samsung, although don't expect it to be ready for the home just yet...\nRead the full transparent Samsung Micro LED story\nMLA OLED tech reported to hit 3000 nits peak brightness Much like the tech behind\u00a0Samsung's S95D QD-OLED TV\u00a0that's expected to hit 3000 nits of peak brightness, LG has announced its 2024 MLA OLED TV tech can also reach up to 3000 nits of peak brightness. According to LG, 'META Technology 2.0' offers up 42 per cent brighter images than a conventional OLED display.\u00a0 Read the full MLA OLED TV story\nTCL announces a 115-inch Mini LED TV with 20,000 dimming zones, 5000 nits There has been an influx of super-sized TVs lately, but TCL's new 115-inch QM891G takes the biscuit. Not only is the 115QM89 absolutely huge, dwarfing the 98- and 100-inch models previously launched by the likes of Samsung, Hisense and TCL itself \u2013 but it's also got some astonishing numbers on its spec sheet. Read the full TCL 115QM89 TV story\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV is the Z95A OLED with brighter MLA panel and Fire OS Panasonic claims that the Z95A will be brighter than the outgoing top-tier MZ2000. The company says it has achieved this through 'improvements to the driving technology' and a 'multi-layer heat management configuration'.\u00a0In an unexpected move, the company has finally jettisoned its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS, too...\nRead the full Panasonic Z95A OLED TV story\nLG announces its entire 2024 TV lineup LG has revealed its full 2024 TV range, consisting of new updates to some of our favourite\u00a0OLED TVs\u00a0from last year, and interesting new takes on its\u00a0QNED TVs.\u00a0With that being said, it's not an especially revolutionary-looking TV lineup from LG this year, as many of the biggest updates came as part of the 2023 lineup. Read our LG 2024 OLED TV range explainer Or everything you need to know about the mid-tier C4 and premium G4\nLG's new Signature OLED TV is a see-through spectacle It wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG has immediately stolen the show with its latest revelation. Last year, it introduced a wireless OLED TV in the form of the\u00a0M3 OLED\u00a0\u2013 so how has it upstaged that? Well, this transparent statement \u00a0Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets. Read the full LG Signature OLED T TV story\nSamsung's 8K Neo QLED TVs use AI to supercharge picture and sound quality It is claimed that a new processor boasts a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) twice as fast as that found on last year\u2019s 8K model, with eight times as many neural networks on hand to help maximise picture quality. The TV offers a range of features designed to improve picture quality, not least \u20188K AI Upscaling Pro\u2019 which is used to bring lower-resolution content up to 8K. Read the full Samsung 7K Neo QLED TV story\nThe Samsung S95D QD-OLED TV will almost certainly have a 3000-nit panel Samsung Display has developed a third-generation\u00a0QD-OLED\u00a0panel that is capable of producing 3000\u00a0nits\u00a0of brightness. That's a huge 1000-nit increase in brightness over the second-gen QD-OLED panel featured in models such as the\u00a0Samsung S95C\u00a0and\u00a0Sony A95L. And we can expect it to be part and parcel of the company's successor to last year's S95C...

Just six months ago we were taking a look at the\u00a0Horizon Ultra, which was the world's first\u00a0Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector; and we assumed that's about as far as the company would take its Horizon series. Well, the brand's latest reveal at\u00a0CES\u00a0has proven us wrong, as the Ultra has been surpassed by a new model. Introducing the Horizon Max... Read the full Xgimi Horizon Max story\nJBL launches its Live TWS 3 series earbuds JBL\u2019s Live TWS 3 series features the latest charging case tech and a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen.

It's also launched the UBoom X portable Bluetooth speaker, which sports 30 hours, IP67 rating and can charge your phone too.\nRead the full EarFun story\nCES 2024 preview: what to expect\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT Livestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT Livestream: Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT Livestream: Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different.\nIn fact, we now know that new B4, C4, G4 and M4 models are definitely on the way. Firstly thanks to a leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4), and then through an official announcement. We also know that all of the upcoming LG TVs will include free updates for at least five years.\nThe M4 and G4 TVs will launch with an entirely new Alpha 11 AI processor, whereas the C4 will instead include an upgraded version of the previous Alpha 9 chip. The B4 will receive a new processor in the form of the Alpha 8 AI Processor.\nWe were looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 would trickle down to the mainstream C4 model this year. Unfortunately with the latest information announcement, that does not seem to be the case.\nMuch like the M3 OLED TV announced in 2023, the upcoming M4 features a wireless Zero Connect Box to house internal components and port selection. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nLG has already taken the wraps off its cute little CineBeam Qube 4K projector and wireless Dolby Atmos soundbars, so expect more details on both.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT Livestream: LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company has shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nWe're hoping to see some slightly more reasonable TVs from the brand at CES as well.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT Livestream: Hisense at CES 2024\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT Livestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES, and some of JBL's forthcoming products have won awards. The JBL Authentics 500 picked up a Best of Innovation award for its combination of retro styling and Dolby Atmos sound tech, while the lower-specced Authentics 200 and 300, and JBL's in-car Club Series speakers were all honourees.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place this week, between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the Sunday 7th and Monday 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nI've tested the latest MLA-OLED TV and the upgrades aren't as game-changing as I'd hoped\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz, as well as MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nSamsung Galaxy S24: rumours, leaks and expected release date\nAirPods not working?
