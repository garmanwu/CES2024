For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year.

There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nBest of CES 2024: The PC hardware that wowed us\nOf course, we knew that AI would figure prominently at this year\u2019s CES. It\u2019s the technology story du jour after all. But as CES veterans, we\u2019ve seen such sparkling promises of the next big thing eventually fizzle. 3D televisions, anyone? Thankfully there was plenty of meat-and-potatoes PC tech on display in Las Vegas to satisfy the cravings of PC enthusiasts here and now.\nWhether you\u2019re a road warrior, a PC builder, a lover of games both old and new, or a content creator, we saw some truly exciting products for PC users of every stripe, and, yes, some of it even includes AI.\nMSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED monitor\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nMSI could\u2019ve left well alone with the\u00a0MEG 321URX QD-OLED monitor. I mean, it\u2019s impressive as hell just off pure specs alone: This 32-inch, 4K, 240Hz OLED monitor with DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification and 99% coverage of the DCI-P3 color spectrum is already better than everyone owns except the 0.01 percent of PC enthusiasts, in a form factor those enthusiasts have been begging for. GIMME!\nBut MSI didn\u2019t stop there. The company also infused the monitor with several AI capabilities, the most intriguing of which is AI Skylight. In the ultra-popular\u00a0League of Legends, AI Skylight keeps tabs on where your enemies are elsewhere on the battlefield, cluing you in to incoming hostiles via large red skulls with directional indicators so you\u2019re never caught flat-footed. MSI\u2019s also working on training the AI feature in other esports games like\u00a0Dota 2, while a separate AI-powered lightbar across the bottom of the display provides quick visual indicators of things like your health in\u00a0League\u00a0and your ammo count in\u00a0Counter-Strike\u00a0(better make those last few shots count).\nBetter yet (kinda)? Since the MEG 321URX does all its processing within the monitor itself, it skirts existing cheat detection software so you won\u2019t catch a ban for using the tools.\u00a0\u2013Brad Chacos\nAMD Ryzen 8500G\nAMD\nSix cores, 12 threads, 5.0GHz turbo clock speeds,\u00a0no\u00a0AI: $179. Why would we award a Best of CES award to a chip that lacks Ryzen AI, when AMD is the first to release an AI NPU on a desktop processor?\nColor me/us a bit skeptical about AI right now, when its value hasn\u2019t yet been proven. And the $229 that AMD is charging for the nearly identical 8600G is $50 more than the 8500G, which at $179 just feels like a solid value. As for Intel, its 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh parts just feel a little too similar to the 13th-gen parts right now, lacking a solid gen-over-gen improvement. Maybe further testing will change our minds. \u2013Mark Hachman\nMSI Claw\nBrad Chacos/Foundry\nThe battle among handheld gaming PCs continues to rage on, and at CES 2024, an exciting new entrant appeared: MSI\u2019s Claw. Not only is this MSI\u2019s first jump into the handheld arena, it also marks the first handheld to feature Intel\u2019s Core Ultra processor with Arc graphics, which looks to take on AMD\u2019s dominance in the space. With my limited time on the show floor I was impressed by the build quality and design, and the software seems to be coming along nicely, as well. Performance and battery life are still be determined, which can make or break a device, but I believe we now have a viable competitor to the Steam Deck and ROG Ally. \u2014 Adam Patrick Murray\nMSI\u2019s Claw portable gaming PC is my pick for CES. Not for what it is (because frankly, its chipset is the only interesting thing about it), but for what it represents. The Steam Deck seemed like an experiment two years ago, and being quickly copied by smaller indies that relied upon crowdfunding didn\u2019t change that. But now huge players like Lenovo, Asus, and MSI want a piece of the pie, and can compete at prices below $1,000. It\u2019s clear that the portable gaming PC is a form factor with some staying power. \u2014 Michael Crider\nLenovo\u2019s prepper-friendly wireless mouse and keyboard\nMark Hachman / IDG\nThe most unusual concept I\u2019ve ever seen has to be Lenovo\u2019s\u00a0hand-cranked mouse and spinning dial wireless keyboard. The 12,800 DPI wireless mouse has a pull-out crank that, if you physically spin it around enough times, will generate 30 minutes of power. The wireless keyboard works in a similar fashion but instead of a pull-out crank, you just spin the Surface Dial-like knob on the upper-left corner of the deck. Spin this bad boy for five minutes and boom! You now have enough juice for 30 minutes. It\u2019s definitely an interesting concept that speaks to the prepper zeitgeist, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll ever be ready for liftoff. After all, it the battery is dead why not just plug into the PC? \u2013Ashley Biancuzzo\nROG NUC gaming PC\nAsus\nHaving a third kid in 2023 was a great joy, but it does mean space is now getting a little tight around my apartment. Suddenly, my giant gaming rig is looking a little oversized \u2014 like the equivalent of Hollywood\u2019s iconic Mount Rushmore lumped on the floor between a pile of garish-looking soft toys and definitely-now-a-choking-hazard LEGO blocks.\nThankfully, Asus has fixed my problem by announcing the ROG NUC mini-PC at CES 2024 \u2014 and yes, we\u2019ve all seen mini-PCs before, but this is a little different, with a choice of Intel Core Ultra 9 or Core Ultra 7 processors, Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4070 GPUs, and up to 32GB DDR5 / 5600MHz RAM. It\u2019s got me salivating at the prospect of the kind of high-end gaming I\u2019ll be able to do on a PC whose case is an apartment-friendly 2.5 liters in volume.\nAlthough small, the ROG NUC\u2019s connectivity looks state of the art, too. The desktop has Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, and no less than six USB-A ports, a Thunderbolt 4 port, HDMI port, 2x display ports, dual 3.5mm audio jacks, and a full-sized SD card reader. No word from Asus about pricing yet, so fingers crossed it will land in a hip-pocket-friendly price zone. \u2013Dominic Bayley\nDual-screen laptops (Lenovo Yoga Book 9i & Asus Zenbook Duo)\nAsus\nI love screen real estate\u2014and so I\u2019ve always hated long sessions on just a laptop. But two new dual-screen notebooks shown at this year\u2019s CES are making me rethink my stance \u2014 they offer the multi-monitor experience without the hassle of actually packing and setting up a portable display. I\u2019m partial to\u00a0Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Book 9i, which is a bit smaller and offers more flexibility with the detachable keyboard\u2019s positioning, but Asus\u2019s equally luxe yet cheaper\u00a0(by $500!)\u00a0Zenbook Duo\u00a0looks just as tempting. I don\u2019t need\u00a0a new laptop, but I now want one. \u2013Alaina Yee\nThe two full-sized OLED screens on Lenovo\u2019s brand-new\u00a0Yoga Book 9i laptop are absolutely stunning and versatile as hell. You can use it like a conventional clamshell laptop or a dual-screen PC setup. If you\u2019re going for the latter, the screens can be positioned either horizontally or vertically. The whole package weighs just under 3 pounds as well, which is impressive given the additional display. It even features the latest 14th-Gen Intel Core U-class CPU and a maximum of 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. I\u2019m really looking forward to trying out this device myself. \u2013Ashley Biancuzzo\nAsus BTF ecosystem\nBrad Chacos/IDG\nWe declared\u00a0the War on Cables the hottest PC trend of 2023\u00a0after Computex last summer, and at CES 2024, the concept got real. MSI and Maingear were busy showing off their \u201cProject Zero\u201d initiative for a cable-free desktop PC, but Asus\u2019 rival concept \u2014 dubbed \u201cBTF,\u201d for \u201cBack to the Future\u201d \u2014 impressed me the most.\nWhile all these concepts move most wiring to the back of the motherboard for a pristine aesthetic, only Asus uses a proprietary 600W PCIe high-power connector on its graphics cards as well, letting you slot them into the motherboard without any power cables poking out from the frontside, for a truly wireless interior (well, except the tubing for AIO CPU coolers, natch). It\u2019s a wickedly clean look, though Asus motherboards will still work just fine with\u00a0any\u00a0GPU if you\u2019d like.\nAsus expects to start selling bundled BTF kits (motherboard, graphics card, case) under its TUF brand sometime around February, while a higher-end ROG Strix BTF bundle will land late in this quarter. Even better, Asus already signed up nine case partners \u2014 including heavyweights like Corsair, Lian Li, Cooler Master, Silverstone, and BeQuiet \u2014 who\u2019ve pledged to support the BTF project. The War on Cables is beginning in earnest.\u00a0\u2013Brad Chacos\nHyperkin Mega 95\nHyperkin\nGrab those baggy pants, flip your hat backwards, and dust off the old boxes of Sega Genesis cartridges. Hyperkin is here with the Mega 95, a new handheld console capable of playing your old Sega Genesis cartridges. Modeled after a Genesis controller, it comes with a 5-inch screen and up to 10 hours of battery life. The screen will also be capable of toggling between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio modes. Eat my shorts,\u00a0Genesis Nomad.\nThis new Mega 95 is seemingly a handheld version of Hyperkin\u2019s MegaRetroN HD console, but with some upgrades. Not only will it allow you to take your games on the go, but it also comes with a dock to connect to your TV via HDMI and two ports for controllers. Get ready to fire up Sonic again and finally collect those last Chaos Emeralds. \u2013Sam Singleton\nThermaltake Tower 300\nFoundry\nThe Thermaltake Tower 300 stood out in a sea of \u201cjust another box\u201d PC cases this year. No six sides here, we\u2019re talking octagonal,\u00a0with wicked airflow from bottom to top, unless you\u2019ve got it on it\u2019s side with the optional stand that is giving me real Doom Slayer power-up vibes. The real kicker here is that while the Tower 300 can support MiniITX motherboards, it\u2019s designed around the MicroATX form factor which is something we haven\u2019t seen much of lately. Oh, and if you don\u2019t like the Thermaltake 25th Anniversary Blue, you can opt for traditional white and black, but also yellow, green, and turquoise!\u00a0\u2013Keith May\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo\nCES 2024 had its fair share of interesting laptop configurations and form factors \u2013 take the two multi-monitor laptops above as prime examples \u2013 but Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid offers its own very unique take on the genre. As a Windows laptop the specs are pretty standard: Core 7 Ultra CPU, Arc graphics, 32GB RAM, 1TB storage. What makes it stand out is how cleverly it functions as both a Windows laptop, when the 14.5 inch OLED panel is docked in the keyboard, or as a conventional Android tablet when the panel is undocked, complete with a built-in Snapdragon processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and support for touch or pen input.\nYes, all the PC parts are in the keyboard! That means that the keyboard itself can be attached to a large monitor to form yet a third configuration that\u2019s suited to stationary desktop work. How clever is that? \u2013Katherine Stevenson\n2024 Razer Blade 16\nRazer\nEvery year Razer\u2019s Blade 14 gaming laptop leaves me a little awestruck, its portability, power-to-size ratio, and quality of its visuals just seems to all meld together perfectly \u2014 plus, it arguably offers the best bang for buck in Razer\u2019s lineup. This year, however, it\u2019s the laptop\u2019s larger sibling, the Razer Blade 16, that\u2019s really caught my eye \u2014 the reason? Its OLED display.\nI\u2019ve been waiting for OLED displays to come of age, and go one better than the 15-inch QHD 240Hz display we saw in the 2023 Razer Blade 15, and the Blade 16 does just that, upping the ante to a whopping QHD+ (2560\u00d71600) OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate in a larger 16-inch panel, in what Razer claims is the first of its kind ever made. Larger, more fluid, even more gorgeously rendered OLED visuals? Yes, please!\nUnder the hood, the top-tier Blade 16 also looks absolutely ripped, with a 14th-gen Intel Core i9\u201314900HX CPU and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU onboard. It\u2019s loaded with the kind of hardware that could make me a legend, if not a demi-god, in games like, Counterstrike 2 and Fortnite. \u2013Dominic Bayley\nAlienware AW3225QF OLED Monitor\nDell\nDell has already made a splash in gamer circles with its OLED ultrawides, combining the much sought-after premium panel with surprisingly attainable prices. But the 32-inch Alienware AW3225QF might just become the large-format monitor of choice for desktop and laptop users who want to revel in both games and standard media. Its 4K resolution and 240Hz speed mean it\u2019s ideal for showing off both PC and console games at their best, with a 1000-nit peak brightness that makes it the better of many OLED monitors already on the market.\nWith a subtle curve, ultra-thin panel, and both HDMI and DisplayPort 2.1 options, it boasts both looks and capability. I also dig the bottom-mounted USB-A and USB-C ports, all the easier for plugging in a phone or accessories. While it doesn\u2019t have the lightning speed of the smaller Alienware 27-inch OLED (also on display at CES), it\u2019s certainly a showpiece for anyone who\u2019s built a desk setup with a focus on visual splendor. The AW3225QF is currently available from Dell\u2019s online store for $1199.99. \u2013Michael Crider\nMemryX MX3\nMark Hachman / IDG\nThe MemryX MX3 is the first third-party AI accelerator card to land in a PC. The company\u2019s debut effort may be of modest value (MemryX claims 40 TFLOPs per card, which isn\u2019t that different than some of the NPU power that chip vendors currently boast.)\nBut we may be on the cusp of a moment where a new generation of AI chip startups launch AI accelerator cards for the PC. Lenovo is already planning to include them in a ThinkCentre desktop, and says there are more out there than we\u2019ve heard of. MemryX may not be the best of this bunch, but it\u2019s at the surface of a movement that may alter the landscape of the PC. \u2013Mark Hachman\nHardware we could do without: Transparent TVs\nLG\nI saw transparent screens at CES more than a decade ago. They were just as dumb then as they are now. Outside of some extremely niche applications in advertising and public signage, there\u2019s simply no reason a consumer would want to look at both a TV or monitor-sized screen (with a worse image than a standard one) and whatever\u2019s behind it. Which is usually a blank wall. There\u00a0are\u00a0uses for this technology \u2014 smart glasses come to mind, to say nothing of heads-up displays in all kinds of vehicles. But trying to put them in consumers\u2019 homes reeks of an industry desperate for a gimmick to push. \u2013Michael Crider\nAuthor: Katherine Stevenson, Managing Editor\nManaging Editor Katherine Stevenson is a tech media veteran who was Editor in Chief of Maximum PC before joining PCWorld.\nRecent stories by Katherine Stevenson:\nCoupon Codes\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nDeals\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nManage Subscription\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"
