        "raw_content": "Sony And Honda Unveil Updated Afeela Prototype At CES 2024\nThe electric sedan has seen a host of revisions that point to it being production-ready.\nSony Honda Mobility has unveiled an updated version of the Afeela prototype at CES 2024. The sleek electric sedan has seen several revisions, with the company noting the latest iteration is closer to production guise than before.\nThis gives us a better idea of what to expect when the Afeela debuts in 2025. Visually, the four-door benefits from revised front-end styling. The front bumper has been redesigned with a sporty black strip on the lower fascia. More pronounced than before, the face benefits from illuminated badging, a full-width light bar, and wrap-around headlights.\nWorking backward, Afeela now wears traditional side mirrors, unlike the slim cameras seen last year. The slim roof pillars have made way for thicker ones, but the gloss black finish and flush fitment still give off the \"full glass\" illusion that the concept previewed.\nSimilar changes can be seen at the rear, where the Afeela receives a chunkier bumper and what appears to be an active rear spoiler. The trunk lid doesn't taper off quite as dramatically as before, but it's still attractive. We see traces of Lucid Air and Toyota Crown in the overall design. Perhaps the next-generation Honda Accord will borrow styling cues from this EV.\nStep inside, and the Afeela has received several cabin revisions. Many things have been carried over from the original car. This includes the yoke-style steering wheel and a screen that spans the width of the fascia. However, the prototype boasts a larger center console with dual wireless charging pads and several other updates.\nAt the unveiling, company President and COO Izumi Kawanishi discussed technological advancements. This includes using AI (artificial intelligence) for driver assistance systems.\nAI will work together with several unnamed sensing devices for the ADAS functions. Sony Honda Mobility has said it will adopt Vision Transformer - a deep learning model specializing in image recognition - for path planning. A redundancy system will also be put in place to ensure safety. The automaker will rely on Qualcomm's high-performance system-on-chips.\nOn the entertainment front, Sony Honda Mobility has partnered with Epic Games to create genuinely breathtaking immersive displays that can simulate external environmental conditions for pedestrians, weather, and other vehicles. The system uses the Unreal Engine 5.3 gaming engine. It will be interesting to see whether Sony Honda Mobility takes advantage of this collaboration and introduces in-car gaming like other brands have.\nSpeaking of gaming, Sony Honda Mobility also announced a partnership with Polyphony Digital that will see the electric Afeela introduced to Gran Turismo 7 later this year.\nOther partnerships include collaborating with Microsoft, with the companies co-developing a \"conversational personal agent\" based on the latter's Azure OpenAI software. Very little has been disclosed thus far, but it seems Sony Honda Mobility wants to lead the segment in sophisticated digital assistants. It's worth noting that Volkswagen announced at CES 2024 that it will implement ChatGPT into its vehicles this year.\nAs a reminder, the Afeela uses Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors found on the front and rear axles. Both produce 241 horsepower, so we can expect total outputs of 482 hp. The 91 kWh lithium-ion battery pack can be charged at speeds of up to 150 kW (on a DC charger), but Sony Honda Mobility has not mentioned the range.\nInterestingly, the vehicle has grown slightly since we first saw it and now measures 193.5 inches long. All other dimensions remain the same. Expect a few more changes ahead of its debut next year."

The recent concept remains the same as the prototype that was unveiled at CES 2023, but this time, AFEELA is gearing towards mass production. The recent electric vehicle design with artificial intelligence capabilities is packed with technological features, following the announcement of the mobility company with Epic Games, Microsoft, and Polyphony Digital.\nSony Honda Mobility teams up with Epic Games to use Unreal Engine and create an augmented reality experience with the infotainment and navigation system of the AFEELA electric car. Previewed at CES 2024, AFEELA is expected to have a video-game-like GPS\u00a0 and navigation where the driver can activate the road maps to look like they\u2019re playing as they cruise. The data captured from the advanced sensors of the electric car is translated into real-time 3D objects and allows the drivers to view their current location from any angle.\nimages courtesy of Sony Honda Mobility\nSony honda mobility uses 3D road maps and AI assistant\nSony Honda Mobility is also using 3D mapping technology with Epic Games for the AFEELA electric car. This means playful visual additives, such as monsters popping out of buildings or adding under-the-sea effects in the driving screen, can be activated by the driver and the front passenger. Aside from having an immersive cabin and driving experience with Epic Games, Sony Honda Mobility is also joined by Microsoft for the artificial intelligence to give the driver their personal mobility agent.\nThe collaboration entails that Microsoft is co-developing a conversational personal agent for AFEELA\u2019s system using the Azure OpenAI service. The voice-enabled setup with a human-like accent and tone allows the driver to talk to their personal mobility agent as if they were chatting with a real person. Other technologies installed in the cabin include large infotainment screens for everyone, a noise-canceling interior resembling soundproof cinemas, and Sony\u2019s spatial audio throughout the seats and cabin.\nSony Honda Mobility introduces the new prototype of AFEELA electric car at CES 2024\nAutonomous parking for the AFEELA electric car\nAFEELA comes equipped with ultra-wideband sensors and cameras too. As the driver approaches, the electric car greets them with a light and automatically opens the doors for them. Once they are inside, the EV runs an authentication process to make sure the driver is the right owner and sets up the destination and route map on a panoramic display. As they drive, AFEELA\u2019s sensors and cameras monitor every angle, watching traffic conditions and, based on the high-precision data acquired, providing driving assistance.\nSony Honda Mobility uses the potential of AI, sensors, and cameras by making AFEELA autonomous enough to park itself even when the driver leaves the electric car. At CES 2024, Sony Honda Mobility, led by Representative Director, President, and COO Izumi Kawanishi, shared that AFEELA also features a thematic cabin. Here, the driver can choose a certain theme that they want for their driving experience, and the smart cabin will automatically change its lighting, sound, and display to correspond to the chosen theme.\nthe 2024 prototype of AFEELA is geared towards mass production\nGlancing at the front exterior, users may see a strip of LED dipslide just below the curved light. It is here that they can find AFEELA\u2019s Media Bar, which acts as an external information display. It can alert anyone outside the car about certain information, such as flashing a warning sign if the vehicle is too close to a rear bumper, projecting the battery percentage, and playing animated sequences to make it look like billboard advertising on the go.\nFor specs buffs, the AFEELA electric car is set to have a front and rear electric motor power of 180 kilowatts and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery capacity of 91 kilowatts. Stepping inside the vehicle, a noticeable low-contrast color palette and series of fine textures create an inviting space for the driver and passengers, with seats that are made of aluminum and glass. While AFEELA is already heading towards mass production, Sony Honda Mobility has yet to announce a defined timeline for its electric car.\nSony Honda Mobility teams up with Epic Games for the game-like AR road maps of the electric car\nAFEELA is also expected to have Microsoft-backed, voice-enabled personal mobility agent\nPresident and COO Izumi Kawanishi presenting AFEELA at CES 2024\ninside the AFEELA electric car with panoramic display\nSony Honda Mobility uses ultra-wide sensors and cameras for AFEELA so it can monitor its surroundings from any angle\nthe seats inside the electric car are made of aluminum and glass\nview of the steering wheel which visitors to CES 2024 can see\nsnippet of the game-like AR road maps developed by Epic Games for AFEELA\nSony Honda Mobility is yet to announce the production timeline of the AFEELA electric car\nproject info:\nname: AFEELA\ncompany: Sony Honda Mobility\nevent: CES 2024\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (323)\nCAR DESIGN (776)\nCES 2024 (12)\nELECTRIC AUTOMOBILES (629)\nEPIC GAMES (6)\nHONDA (70)\nMICROSOFT (33)\nSONY (64)\nPRODUCT LIBRARY\na diverse digital database that acts as a valuable guide in gaining insight and information about a product directly from the manufacturer, and serves as a rich reference point in developing a project or scheme.\ndesignboom will always be there for you"

Sure, it looks exactly the same, because physically it is, but the partnership says that the development happening behind the scenes is making the hardware better and better in advance of its release, which the company still says is on track for later in the decade.\nWhile Honda has a robust (though far from perfect) driver aid suite, the company has stopped short of offering higher levels of driverless autonomy, choosing instead to focus their EV development on more driver-centric themes. We've yet to see a major autonomous concept from Honda itself since the company committed to electrifying, even if it has teased the notion that self-driving cars are seen as inevitable.\nThe company also announced that it will bring new \"experiences\" to the cabin thanks to a partnership with Epic Games, so we can expect to see some Tesla-like entertainment options floated, games included.\nFor the time being, SHM has just a couple of years to show us a fleshed out production car.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nI played Horizon Forbidden West inside Sony and Honda's Afeela concept EV at CES 2024\nThe Afeela EV inches closer to reality and goes on preorder next year.\nA year since Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) announced its debut EV concept, the Afeela, the company is back at CES 2024 in Las Vegas to offer more details, more collaborations and a driving simulator.\nThe name of the concept vehicle hasn\u2019t changed since last we saw it. What is new, however, is the car's ability to be driven around with a PlayStation controller. I didn\u2019t get to do that \u2014 it was a stunt operated by one of the company's employees \u2014 but there was a DualSense controller involved in my demo.\nSo let\u2019s begin where SHM left off. At last year\u2019s CES 2023, Sony revealed the Afeela Concept EV, which packed in 45 cameras and an expansive \u201cmedia bar\u201d that spread across the vehicle's dash, showing a mix of car information, navigation, music players and more. The steering wheel was redesigned as a yoke so that the driver can better view that sumptuous dash. The company also further teased some mixed-reality tricks in collaboration with Epic Games.\nThe Afeela EV itself looks mostly the same as the prototype from last year, although it now has a substantial LiDAR bar above the windscreen that looks like a giant smartphone notch. The company says that the car will be available for pre-order in 2025 before going on sale in the US the following year.\nAt CES 2024, I got to step inside an Afeela, while an SHM representative gave me a tour of everything that\u2019s so far been crammed into this concept vehicle.\nCombining both Sony and Honda\u2019s expertise, the Afeela will create its own noise cancellation bubble, apparently \u201ctailoring the cabin for entertainment\u201d using Sony\u2019s Spatial Audio technology. According to SHM\u2019s renders, there appear to be roughly 30 speakers, although that\u2019s more than likely to change as the concept further evolves. A spokesperson added that over 42 sensors grace the Afeela\u2019s initial spec sheet.\nIn one of the most surreal experiences I\u2019ve had at CES, I also got to play Horizon Forbidden West on the Afeela's expansive dashboard display. No, there isn\u2019t a PS5 baked into this concept EV \u2014 why not, though? \u2014 but a demonstration involving PlayStation\u2019s long-running Remote Play feature. Sure, the Bluetooth connection to the controller was temperamental (CES is just hundreds of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals clashing), but conceptually, you get that it\u2019s possible. The two screens for passengers sitting in the rear would also be able to display games, movies and more; however they were just dummy screens in this demo car.\nSHM also announced during Sony\u2019s CES show that it\u2019s already teamed up with Microsoft to use its Azure OpenAI technology to create a \u201cMobility Personal Agent\u201d \u2014 a conversational in-car virtual assistant for drivers and passengers alike.\nIt\u2019s also working with Polyphony Digital, the company behind Gran Turismo, on a nebulous goal of developing vehicles that \u201cfuse the virtual and the real, mainly in the area of human senses.\u201d For now, that collaboration has resulted in an Afeela you can drive in Gran Turismo.\nBut it\u2019s the new dash, combined with AR graphics overlays and that LiDAR notch, which intrigues me most. The EV will draw information and imagery from its sensors and create 3D models of the outside world. This can be used for frivolous things, like Godzilla-styled monsters on your dashcam feed and augmented reality games. Or more simply, rich, detailed overlays for navigation to nearby businesses and destinations.\nWhile we weren\u2019t driving the Afeela EV around Las Vegas, SHM tried to offer the next best thing: a car simulator made in collaboration with Epic Games (and what appears to be that Unreal Engine 5 Matrix demo). Steering around the virtual world, in an Aveela cockpit (in a moody black colorway, different from the light gray showroom car I sat in earlier), the digital wing mirrors also displayed the same highly realistic 3D world. The dash display then offered an AR overlay, showing vehicles, objects and pedestrians, flagging nearby hazards in red.\nSHM is still putting a lot of its focus on developing its autonomous driving technology and advanced driver assistance systems, the latter are non-autonomous helper features, similar to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot. With Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Ride SoC powering the concept vehicle\u2019s advanced driving features, the Afeela could reach limited Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. At that point (and we\u2019re not there yet) a vehicle can manage most aspects of driving without any human intervention. A spokesperson added it would be capable of Level 2 Plus autonomous driving in urban settings. SHM also teased traffic monitoring through the sensors, detection for objects like traffic cones, and apparently, using what it calls a Vision Transformer that will work to detect environmental characteristics \u201cin a broader perspective\u201d \u2014 this could translate into predicting future traffic jams before you meet them or alternative driving routes.\nThe car will also utilize all those sensors more frivolously, to detect drivers' approach and open the door for them. The same sensors, including LiDAR and cameras, will guide the Afeela as it parks itself.\nMany of us still wonder if SHM\u2019s EV will ever exist as a consumer vehicle. The commitment to getting its car on roads by 2026 is still there, and while CES may be the perfect audience for the hype being served up, will car buyers think the same?\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

        "raw_content": "Sony\u2019s Afeela needs to be more than a feeling\nSony\u2019s Afeela needs to be more than a feeling\nStepping into the Sony Honda car.\nBy\nSean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\nShare this story\nIt\u2019s been four years since we called Sony\u2019s concept car the best surprise of CES. And I get it: one does not build a car company overnight. But here at CES 2024, it feels like Sony Honda Mobility is still building a concept car \u2014 dare I say, a Vision \u2014 rather than a vehicle focused on the road. Maybe that\u2019s part of the charm?\nThe Afeela has gotten more car-like in some ways since last year\u2019s full announcement: big side mirrors, wireless phone chargers, and some more actual car specs. The all-wheel drive prototype has two 180kW motors (roughly 483 horsepower), a 91kWh lithium-ion battery pack, and up to 150kW fast DC charging.\n1/20\n1/20\nBut when we climbed inside the Afeela\u2019s cabin for the first time at CES, as you\u2019ll see in our embedded gallery and video, Sony Honda wasn\u2019t focused on the car part. Rather, Sony Honda wanted us to know that its car is a thumping movie theater and entertainment cockpit, despite its narrow (but impressively wide) strip of screen, and that the front bumper can help make you a rolling advertisement for Sony movies and Sony video games (not kidding) by pressing a button in its dedicated smartphone app.\nWe did get to briefly touch the steering wheel and open the doors, but everything else was hands-off \u2014 we were there to experience the mere feeling of being in an Afeela, and that\u2019s all. (I would describe that feeling as \u201ccushy neon.\u201d)\nWhile the company maintains the car will be available for preorder in 2025 and begin deliveries in 2026, it\u2019s still not done adding to its more concept-y features, inking new partnerships with Microsoft to use Azure to create an AI \u201cconversational personal agent\u201d and with Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital to \u201cdevelop vehicles that fuse the virtual and the real.\u201d\nThe driver\u2019s seat rumbled impressively while watching a Gran Turismo movie trailer; less impressively, we discovered that its ability to play PlayStation games on that strip of screen is currently just a PlayStation Remote Play connection to your PS5 at home \u2014 a PlayStation Portal on wheels.\nAt least, for now. Whether an actual PlayStation might appear in the car is one of the many things that\u2019s still undecided, Sony Honda Mobility president and COO Izumi Kawanishi tells The Verge. The car\u2019s speed and range aren\u2019t decided yet or even the basic driving functions, though the car will be made in a Honda factory and benefit from Honda\u2019s expertise. When I ask what keeps him up at night, Kawanishi says it\u2019s the AI because key features like Level 3 self-driving and the personal assistant aren\u2019t there because the AI itself isn\u2019t finalized.\nFrom the beginning, it felt like Sony badly wanted this car to feel different than its peers, and maybe it does, but not yet in the way that Sony Honda wants. Kawanishi, a longtime Sony exec who worked on the PS3, PSP, Sony Mobile phones, and the fourth-generation Aibo, says his goal is to \u201ccontribute to the evolution of the future of mobility.\u201d When I ask him how Afeela will do that, he says he believes the future of mobility is autonomous driving and the personal assistant \u2014 that this car needs to be intelligent. Right now, it\u2019s not.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t mind driving a concept-y, high-tech car rather than one whose edges have all been sanded off to cater to the masses, and I suspect that\u2019s one of the reasons Tesla has been so successful with its software-updatable vehicles \u2014 including controversial features that go too far. But Sony Honda hasn\u2019t yet given us enough concrete reasons to want an Afeela.\nThe next time we slide into the cockpit, here\u2019s hoping it won\u2019t be a hands-off experience with a Sony Honda rep at the controls \u2014 but us driving a car that\u2019s clever enough for both gearheads and nerds to love.\nPhotography by\u00a0Sean\u00a0Hollister\u00a0/ The Verge\nGoogle CEO tells employees to expect more job cuts this year\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s new goal is creating artificial general intelligence\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is smarter, pricier, and just as big as ever\nBose\u2019s wild-looking Ultra Open Earbuds are here \u2014 kind of\nHere\u2019s our first look at Bethesda\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nWi-Fi 7 quietly took off while everyone was looking at AI\nClicks hands-on: this BlackBerry-like iPhone case could be a winner\nSamsung is showing off earbuds cases with screens.\nCorsair, Asus, and others are making it easier to build a beautiful PC\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Honda and Sony Team Up to Launch New EV Brand\nAfeela will focus on advanced driver assistance and a user-centric interior, with a goal to achieve Level 3 automated driving under limited conditions.\nHonda and Sony say they are teaming up to create the car of the future. Afeela is the brand name, designated as a company that represents \"feel,\" and we can expect the joint-venture electric vehicle from Honda and Sony to arrive in the US by 2026.\nUnveiling a prototype at CES with the Afeela name on the hood, the JV brand has now finally come to fruition after years of concepts. The first silhouette of the prototype machine appears as ultramodern, but still in line with current EV design trends.\nWhat sets the new Afeela prototype apart from the traditional automotive market, however, is its approach to mobility. Sony Honda Mobility Inc. CEO Yasuhide Mizuno took the stage at CES to explain the joint company's ethos, calling for a focus shift from \"power and performance to software, networks, and user experiences.\" But what exactly does this mean for the model itself?\nThe initial details of the Afeela prototype are focused entirely on design, with no pricing or power figures to be seen. In spite of this, the design aspects are fascinating. For example, the company fit 45 cameras and sensors within the concept vehicle, in addition to its 800 Tera Operations Per Second of maximum computing power for the electronic controller.\nThe driving experience will be dictated by Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 Snapdragon Digital Chassis, a cloud-connected automotive platform that helps control the chassis dynamics and driver-assistance features.\nWith this computing power and array of sensors, SAE Level 2 driver assistance will be standard and useable in most situations, including urban and city driving. The company also claims a limited Level 3 autonomous driving system is in the works.\nInside the Afeela prototype is a steering yoke, dash-length screen setup, and open concept center console. A company designer says this creates a \"gentle rounded tone\" for the cabin, in the hopes that occupants will feel wrapped in a \"soft cocoon.\" The interior colors were picked with minimal distraction in mind, aiming to make drivers less fatigued.\nOther notable features include intuitive navigation through augmented reality and the creation of a model-based video game world with the help of Epic Games. The twisting of reality doesn't stop there, however, as the company plans to create its own metaverse as well.\nSony Honda Mobility says it will develop a production version of the Afeela. Prospective customers can pre-order the model in the first half of 2025, with delivery slated for spring of 2026.\nSony Honda Mobility isn't the first brand to take a swing at disrupting the traditional power and performance market with a focus on user experience. Hyundai's new Ioniq 6 is approaching the market from a similar angle, targeting interior design, lighting, and augmented driver capabilities.\nWhat's most important to you when buying a car\u2014performance, interior experience, or styling?

This sleek electric sedan has undergone several noteworthy changes, offering a good idea what we can anticipate when it officially launches in 2025.\nVisually, the Afeela shows a more polished appearance, starting with a revamped front-end design. The front bumper now has a sporty black strip on the lower bumper, with illuminated badging, a full-width light bar, and wrap-around headlights. The adoption of traditional side mirrors and slightly thicker roof pillars, albeit with a gloss black finish and flush fitment, were probably necessary in the transition from a concept to a road-ready vehicle.\nAt the rear, the Afeela boasts a beefier bumper and an active rear spoiler, while the trunk lid retains its attractive design. There are clearly visible hints of Lucid Air and Toyota Crown influences in the vehicle's overall aesthetic.\nThe Afeela also reveals significant cabin updates. While some features carry over from the original prototype, such as the yoke-style steering wheel and a wide dashboard-spanning screen, the latest version introduces a larger center console with dual wireless charging pads.\nThe vehicle will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for its driver assistance systems, working in conjunction with several undisclosed sensors. Sony Honda Mobility plans to implement Vision Transformer, a deep learning model specialized in image recognition, for path planning, with a redundancy system in place to ensure safety. Qualcomm's\nchipsets will power these systems.\nOn the entertainment front, Sony Honda Mobility has joined forces with Epic Games to create immersive displays capable of simulating external environmental conditions for pedestrians, weather, and other vehicles. Utilizing the Unreal Engine 5.3 gaming engine, this partnership might pave the way for in-car gaming experiences a class above what is currently available in the market.\nSony Honda Mobility has more exciting plans for gamers, announcing a collaboration with Polyphony Digital to introduce the electric Afeela to Gran Turismo 7 later this year. The company is also working with Microsoft to co-develop a \"conversational personal agent\" based on Azure OpenAI software, aiming to establish itself as a leader in sophisticated digital assistants.\nAs a quick reminder, the Afeela features permanent magnet synchronous motors on both front and rear axles, each producing 241 horsepower, resulting in a total output of 482 hp. While Sony Honda Mobility hasn't disclosed the vehicle's range, it can be charged at up to 150 kW on a DC charger. Interestingly, the Afeela has grown slightly in size, now measuring 193.5 inches in length, while all other dimensions remain consistent with the prototype.\nSource\nReader comments\nnew company, sonda or honny?\nSony Ericsson \u274c\nSony Honda \u2705\nEV finder\nHome\nNews\nCompare\nAbout us\nRSS feed\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\n\u00a9 2022-2023 ArenaEV.com\nMobile version\nEV Finder\nGlossary\nPrivacy\nTerms of use\nFrom the team behind GSMArena.com"

This comes as a part of the joint venture between Sony and Honda that commenced in 2022. The initial debut of their collaborative efforts was witnessed at CES 2023. The showcased prototype not only previews the outgoing model but also represents the evolution of the Afeela electric sedan, which made its first appearance as the Sony Vision-S concept in 2020. With several design updates since then, the sedan is poised to enter production in 2025.\nLet\u2019s quickly have a look at some key details of Afeela Electric Sedan:\nAs part of the CES 2024 press conference, Sony unveiled the Afeela electric concept, a joint development with Honda. The CEO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc., Yasuhide Mizuno, took the stage to share insights into the in-car software experience. A notable highlight was Mizuno\u2019s demonstration of remotely driving the electric vehicle on stage using a PlayStation 5 DualSense controller.\nThe updated prototype of the Afeela electric sedan boasts a redesigned front bumper and a distinctive protruding nose, complemented by a digital display. Sleek headlamps, positioned under a lighted strip on each side of the display, contribute to the sedan\u2019s modern aesthetic. The design incorporates conventional side mirrors and thicker pillars, with anticipated updates to the taillights and rear bumper.\nNotably, the Afeela electric sedan has undergone revisions in its dimensions, now measuring 4,915 mm in length, 1,460 mm in height, and 1,900 mm in width. The longer wheelbase of 3,000 mm adds an extra 20 mm compared to the previous model. Inside the cabin, while maintaining the overall concept, the electric sedan introduces a new center console and a double wireless smartphone charger. Additionally, the interior enhancements include a revised steering wheel and an all-new rearview mirror.\nPowering the Afeela electric sedan are two electric motors integrated into an all-wheel-drive system. Positioned on the front and rear axles, these motors collectively deliver 482 bhp, with each motor capable of producing 241 bhp of peak power. The energy is drawn from a 91-kWh lithium-ion battery set, showcasing Sony and Honda\u2019s commitment to advanced electric propulsion technology.\nLooking ahead, Sony and Honda aim to launch the Afeela electric sedan in 2026.

        "raw_content": "3 cool things Sony showed at CES 2024\nCES 2024 featured some interesting keynotes, from Kia's modular car revolution to Samsung's AI-home renovation schemes. Sony's showcase also boasted several wow moments that stole the stage at this year's conference.\nThere was a lot that Sony covered from its ventures in filmmaking, its cameras, and even some cool floor-based haptic feedback for its theme park. However, if you don't feel like watching the full-hour-long press conference we broke down the coolest moments from Sony's presentation.\nAfeela as a giant RC car\nThe belle of the ball for Sony's CES 2024 keynote was Afeela, an electric vehicle that the company is partnering with Honda to make. Afeela is Sony's attempt at entering the EV market with a car that heavily integrates the company's various entertainment vectors\u2014offering Sony movies, shows, and games into Afeela's entertainment console. There's also a massive amount of cameras and sensors\u201445 in total\u2014in the car, as well as a display built into the front bumper to relay information to cars and pedestrians.\nAnd if it isn't strange enough that the company that makes your PlayStation is entering the vehicle manufacturing game, then you'd love to see the car be controlled with an actual DualSense controller. Yes, in case you haven't seen it already, Izumi Kawanishi, president of the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, drove the car with a PS5 controller during the press conference.\nNo, you won't be able to drive this car with a PS5 controller. But it does seem that Sony has grand ideas for the use cases for the DualSense controller. However, for now, Sony says customers can preorder Afeela in 2025 and expects it to ship in 2026.\nLegend of Zelda movie\nThis was a real blink-or-you-miss-it moment but during the various announcements of Sony's plans to adapt its first-party gaming franchises, the company updated the world on the Legend of Zelda movie. The big reveal from President of Sony Pictures Television Studio Katherine Pope was that the studio will be partnering with Nintendo to bring the Hyrule warrior and his princess to the silver screen.\nIt's a kind of weird endeavor, given the history between Sony and Nintendo, and nothing of much detail was revealed other than the movie is still happening.\nSony also updated viewers that the planned Prime Video's God of War and Netflix's Horizon Zero Dawn shows are beginning pre-production. We also got a quick glimpse of some pre-production footage of the Gravity Rush film adaption as well.\nA new mixed-reality headset\nOne of the recurring themes at CES is virtual reality. Everyone wants to have a virtual reality machine and so does Sony. While the company already has the excellent PSVR2, Sony announced that it has a mixed-reality headset on the way to compete with the Apple Vision Pro.\nYou won't have to wait long for this. Developed in partnership with Siemens, the plan is to have these headsets out in 2024 to target content creators and professionals. It'll be powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip and will feature micro-OLED displays for that stunning 4K resolution for the eyes to feast on.\nThere is, bafflingly enough, no name for this headset as Sony has only referred to it as the \"spatial content creation system.\" As Sony stated during the conference, the goal of this headset is to assist in \"sophisticated 3D content creation.\"\nTopics\nCES\nFilm\nSelf-Driving Cars\nCurrently residing in Austin, Texas, Chance Townsend is an Assistant Editor at Mashable.
