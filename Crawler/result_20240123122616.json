This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the \u2018Smart Life Solution\u2019 Experience\nIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company\u2019s AI-powered smart home utilises various sensors to not only digitise people\u2019s lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customer\u2019s words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitise customers\u2019 heart and breathing rate, analysing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ\u2122 will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices will detect the furry friend\u2019s presence, automatically asking whether to download the \u2018pet mode\u2019 on LG ThinQ\u2122 UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ\u2122 app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers\u2019 daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customised services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalised advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations such as hotels, retail spaces, and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG\u2019s Future Mobility Concept\nGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \u201cpersonalized digital cave.\u201d To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG\u2019s mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilises cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG\u2019s unrivalled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers\u2019 needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG\u2019s EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative: LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG Vision\nLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company\u2019s experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavours at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlight its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives.
