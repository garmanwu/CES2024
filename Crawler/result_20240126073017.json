        "raw_content": "CES 2023: Owl AI launches monocular 3D thermal ranger computer vision for ADAS & autonomous vehicle\nOwl Autonomous Imaging announced the availability of an Evaluation Kit for their new Thermal Ranger\u2122 ADAS & Autonomous Navigation Development Platform.\nThis hardware and software kit enables Tier 1 and OEM automotive companies to easily evaluate Owl AI\u2019s Thermal Ranger imaging solution for use in their Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking (PAEB) and other ADAS applications supporting L2, L2+ and L3/L4 requirements. \u00a0Owl\u2019s monocular thermal camera solution enables 2D & 3D perception for object classification, 3D segmentation of objects, RGB-to-thermal fusion and highly accurate distance measurements.\n\u201cOur unique, patented solutions deliver panoramic thermal imaging and dense range maps are superior to HDR RGB cameras, and/or LiDAR or RADAR sensors for difficult night and blinding light situations,\u201d says Chuck Gershman, CEO of Owl Autonomous Imaging. \u201cUnlike cumbersome stereo camera approaches, a single Owl AI 3D thermal camera delivers distance information throughout the entire field of view (FOV) and is immune to vehicle vibration for reliable and robust mapping. Thermal sensing is an important camera modality which can see in complete darkness as well as in blinding light, which is critical for pedestrian safety.\u201d\nThe Monocular 3D Thermal Ranging Solution, the Thermal Ranger platform not only enables cars to see at night, it also enables the vehicle to know how far away the living object is and what it is.\u00a0\u00a0 Owl\u2019s 3D\u00a0Thermal Ranger\u00a0currently provides VGA image resolution. However, in the near future, using our in-development HD imaging, Ranger will provide a\u00a0150X improvement\u00a0in\u00a0resolution and cloud density over other sensing modalities.\nIt operates day and night, in all weather, and definitively classifies vulnerable road users (VRUs) including pedestrians, cyclists, animals and vehicles, all the while calculating position and direction to enable safe autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicle operation.\nWhen other cameras and perception sensors are blinded by the environment, thermal ranging cameras work.\nThe Thermal RangerTM\u00a0Platform:\nThe platform consists of a thermal imaging camera, an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin AI processor, and the Owl AI software suite including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ROS applications, AI/ML framework and drivers, and necessary cables and adapters. The CNNs operate on the thermal images to provide 3D Object classification and ranging information using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Publish/Subscribe interface. Several example ROS applications are also included.\nAll required software is supplied installed and ready for use. In addition to the software required for operation of the NVIDIA processor, the following modules are included:\nRelated Articles\nBaidu introduces autonomous driving platform for public in Guangzhou\nAutonomouStuff Selects Qumulo to Deliver Fully-Integrated, End-to-End Autonomous Vehicle Research, Data Analytics and File Solutions\nHuawei to invest $1 billion to develop EV and Self-Driving car technology\nMoovit to deploy May Mobility\u2019s autonomous vehicle tech\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024, All Rights Reserved \u00a0|\u00a0 Telematics Wire\nContact: info@telematicswire.net"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: What to expect to see from the automotive industry\nClaimed to be the world\u2019s largest technology event, CES returns to Las Vegas this week and is expected to bring in more than 4,000 exhibitors and 130,000 attendees from across the globe this year.\nAlthough the event touches all industries, the automotive industry will once again take over a large section of the show floor. With many new announcements waiting to be unveiled, here\u2019s an inside glimpse of what to expect to see.\nOwl AI\u2019s thermal night visionOwl Autonomous Imaging (Owl AI), a 3-D thermal night vision sensor and camera solution developer, will demonstrate its new ADAS safety technology for nighttime pedestrian automatic emergency braking (PAEB). With the company\u2019s new HD thermal camera technology and its AI software, the long wave infrared (LWIR) thermal imaging sensors will enable cars to not only see living objects (pedestrians, bicyclists, and large animals) ahead on the road but also to identify what they are, then to tell the driver to slow down or stop. If the driver doesn\u2019t respond quickly enough, it will enable the car to slow down or stop automatically. The sensors are designed to work in complete darkness, bright light, rain, snow, and fog, and can identify warm objects in total darkness up to 200 yards ahead.\nSupernal\u2019s electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle\u00a0Supernal, a U.S.-based mobility service provider, is returning to CES to reveal its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) concept vehicle and Vertiport. Part of Hyundai Motor Group, Supernal\u2019s mission is to make Advanced Air Mobility an additional safe and reliable option for everyday transportation needs. The five-seat, battery-powered electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle is projected to launch in 2028.\nVinFast\u2019s new EV concept\u00a0VinFast is set to introduce its latest EV concept, along with its mini eSUV VF 3 and DrgnFly electric bike. It will also display its all-electric VF 9 full-size SUV which incorporates a new streaming service into the vehicle.\nHyundai Mobis\u2019 \u201ccrab-like\u201d concept vehicleHyundai Mobis is expected to unveil 20 new mobility technologies at CES 2024 \u2014 and they are already prepared to start mass production. This includes their Innovative Display Series which comprises a transparent display. By utilizing holographic optical elements, this display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays. Hyundai Mobis will also introduce its future mobility vehicle that has \u201ccrab-like\u201d lateral driving capabilities (all four wheels turn 90 degrees).\nKIA\u2019s \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicle\u2019Kia will be launching its global \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicle\u2019 (PBV) business at CES and will introduce its future product lineup and business vision. Five concept models will be on display at the show, including its first PBV which is scheduled to hit production in 2025.\nHonda\u2019s all-new global EV seriesHonda will be debuting its all-new global EV series. With its goal to achieve carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities by 2050, the company has proposed an aggressive goal of introducing 30 new EVs globally by 2030. However, no further information has been shared.\nContinue Reading\nPhoto Gallery: CES 2024\nManufacturing, Engineering, Education: Illinois\u2019 New EV Innovation Hub\nSponsored Recommendations\nAutel IA900WA Single System & Workflow: Wheel Alignment & ADAS Calibration\nIA900WA Single System & Workflow: Wheel Alignment & ADAS Calibration\nQuick Tip: FIAT 500 Proxi Alignment\nQuick Tip: Multi Channel Cam/Crank Correlation\nVoice Your Opinion!\nTo join the conversation, and become an exclusive member of Vehicle Service Pros, create an account today!\nLatest in Company/Association News\nAutel Energy debuts MaxiCharger DC HiPower at CES 2024\nEndeavor Business Media\u2019s Vehicle Repair Group Supports Women in Auto Care\nMost Read\nVideo: Top 10 products of July 2023\nVideo: Matco Tools Maximus 5.0\nVideo: Bidirectional testing with Noregon's JPRO\nSponsored\nRecently Introduced Products\nDPF Regeneration: A Comprehensive Guide\nBrushless Fuel Pump - Benefits, History, and How To Read On A Diagnostic Tool"
