Innovation will be the key to helping people take advantage of longer and healthier lives in the coming years, the 38-million-member association says.\nCOVID-19 has made technology more important than ever and helped close the generational tech divide. AARP\u2019s study of technology use shows that ownership, use, and spending among the 50-plus is growing with no signs of slowing down. In that context, the new AgeTech Collaborative is convening leading AgeTech startups, forward-thinking venture capitalists, enlightened industry leaders, and creative testbeds to bring meaningful change and help solve the challenges of aging.\n\u201cCOVID radically grew the world\u2019s reliance on technology, a shift that\u2019s especially notable among people 50-plus,\u201d said Andy Miller, AARP Senior Vice President of Innovation and Product Development.\u00a0\u201cThe AgeTech Collaborative\u2122 is more than an event or forum \u2013 it\u2019s an ecosystem, a one-stop destination, and a sustained effort to make the promises of AgeTech a reality. Everyone 50-plus, families and caregivers will be the ultimate beneficiaries of new, better products and services for the second half of their lives.\u201d\nThe AgeTech Collaborative\u2122 is launching with nearly 50 participating startups, six testbeds where companies can trial their products, more than ten major investors and venture capitalists, several top companies with a stake in the 50-plus community, and service providers helping catalyze startups\u2019 work with tools and services.\n\u201cThere is a pressing need for products and services that help people make informed choices about how they live as they get older,\u201d said Nigel Morris, Managing Partner of QED Investors. \u201cWe want people to make better financial decisions, save for retirement and feel empowered to have financial resiliency. That is why we\u2019re so excited by the efforts of AARP\u2019s AgeTech Collaborative\u2122. AARP is bringing together VCs, industry leaders and entrepreneurs, providing innovative fintech startups the funding and support they need to build truly world-class disruptive companies that will meet the needs of the growing AgeTech community.\u201d\nAdded Kevin Collins, head of Retirement Plan Services: \u201cOne of our priorities at T. Rowe Price is to provide accelerated digital solutions that are personalized, easy, and integrated to help retirement savers achieve the outcomes they desire. We are pleased to work with AARP, one of our plan sponsor clients for over 18 years, in this new way. The AgeTech Collaborative\u2122 will give us the opportunity to increase our exposure to innovative solutions in this emerging space.\u201d\nThe AgeTech Collaborative\u2122 In Detail\nWatch this video about the AgeTech Collaborative\u2122 or visit: agetechcollaborative.org\n# # #\nAbout AARP\nAARP is the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering people 50 and older to choose how they live as they age.
