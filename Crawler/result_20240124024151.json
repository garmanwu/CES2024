        "raw_content": "The e-magazine for KNX home & building control\nAnnual Review: KNX has all the answers\nSimon Buddle looks back over significant developments for KNX in 2023 and forward into 2024, including LED control, RF radiator valves and KNX being embraced by the MDU market.\nAnother year down and possibly time for a little reflection. It is an integral part of the new year along with resolutions, fitness regimes and of course the obligatory dry January to make amends for all the party excesses of the past few weeks.\nIn the KNX world, there have been several new products which I see as huge leaps forward, most notably how we control LED lights. MDT, Jung, Zennio, Meanwell \u2013 \u00a0the list goes on \u2013 have all introduced products that control LEDs in the extra-low-voltage range. This removes the need for third-party drivers by putting KNX in direct control of the LED. For many outside of the KNX community, tuneable white, RGBW and even simply dimming LEDs can still represent challenges. But not for us.\nWhat am I looking forward to in 2024? I think the introduction of the long-awaited RF radiator actuator from ISE. For the retrofit market this will no doubt be a fantastic addition.\nKNX comes of age in the MDU market\nReflecting on 2023, I think the most impressive part of the KNX world must be just how many MDUs (multi dwelling units) have had KNX products specified and installed in them. We all know the value of a well-designed KNX system, and for sure, the core of many of our businesses has been providing bespoke KNX and AV systems for homeowners. Whilst there are elements of each installation that are similar, it is equally true to say that they are all unique or bespoke in nature, tailored specifically to the needs of the individual.\nThe MDU market, however, is different. You are not working for an individual but for a property developer and M&E consultant. Add to the mix the fact that most MDUs are nearly identical in design and layout (apart from an additional bedroom or bathroom here or there), and we can see the same set of KNX products installed repeatedly. Apartment by apartment, the system equipment is identical and the ETS project file is all but the same from one property to the next. So why is KNX so important for us? There are two reasons:\n1. KNX solves problems others cannot\nHistorically, most technical solutions for MDUs have been kludged together using products from many manufacturers, all communicating via different languages. This leads to expensive translator products (BACnet to Modbus or similar) and no end-to-end ownership of the controls. There are three technical issues KNX solves all of the time, every time:\na) Temperature sensor in the lighting keypad, meaning no need for a separate thermostat.b) The heating and cooling by default are interlocked, therefore meeting building regulation requirements and simplifying functionality for the end-user.c) Centralised plantroom control with real-time feedback from all apartments.\nI could list another ten, but we do not have time. One last thought worth mentioning is how easy it is for KNX to provide real-time energy monitoring that can be used for billing to the homeowner. That is a very common feature for many MDUs now.\n2. The world of M&E has woken up to this fact and is now using KNX in a way that no other system on the market allows\nIt feels as if there has been a bit of an epiphany for many in the M&E world. This means that the message is getting through and the solution is working for them. For all the reasons above and many more, the KNX installer can say \u2018yes\u2019 to items that have posed technical issues for consultants for many years.\nProving its worth\nDuring 2023 I worked in five different MDUs either as an extra pair of hands or as part of the M&E team. The first development has two towers totalling 139 apartments. The second, when finished, will have more than 600 apartments. The list goes on. KNX is being specified because it works, it solves many issues, and it is robust. It is a single solution for multiple applications that does not need any crazy expensive language converters. And most importantly, it does not leave any room for interfaces/connections to fall between the specification cracks.\nConclusion\nSo, for me, the highlight of 2023 must be witnessing first-hand KNX\u2019 coming of age as the \u2018go to\u2019 solution for M&E consultants in the world of the MDU. This is validation of the products, the communications protocol and most importantly, those who design and install systems. It means that the message is spreading, and the M&E community are embracing KNX, they understand that it solves problems, that it fits aesthetically, and most crucially, that it works and does the job it is designed to. In turn they can influence the decision makers \u2013 the money people \u2013 that KNX is the right solution to back, in their development. All of that is a testament to the work that the KNX community has done and continues to do. Advertising, evangelising, demonstrating, but more than anything, technically nailing it, job after job, house after house, development after development, and that is what is driving the success of KNX. Things are looking up for 2024!\nSimon Buddle CEng MIET, is a consultant for Future Ready Homes, a specialist in BMS and ELV services system design.\nwww.futurereadyhomes.com\nSPONSORS\nSMALL PRINT\nSHORT CUTS\nCONTACTS\nAll enquiries can be sent to info@knxtoday.com.\nKNX - THE STANDARD\nThe KNX Association is the creator and owner of KNX technology \u2013 the worldwide standard for all applications in home and building control.\nKNXtoday is edited by SYPHA.

It was also good to attend the international KNX National Group event in Berlin in person after a few years of online meetings only, and on the subject of Germany, the consolidation of KNX Germany has given KNX yet another boost and makes us even stronger.\nOver the past year, trends which particularly caught my eye have been the market\u2019s direction towards the IoT, the strengthening of cyber security regulations, and the worldwide push towards CO2 reduction, to name just three. All of these are being addressed by KNX Association and our Members, and I am proud that KNX has done its homework in being well prepared for this brave new world.\nIndeed to all KNX customers, KNX Partners, KNX Members and KNX associated organisations and personnel, I say this: you can be proud to be part of the leading global system for home and building control, and we in the working groups, as well as all Association staff, will work hard to maintain KNX as the market leader. We greatly appreciate your continued support and wish you all\u00a0a merry Christmas and a good start into the New Year!\nJean-Christophe Krieger, Vice President, KNX Association\nAfter some turbulence with the release of ETS6, I think one of KNX Association\u2019s major achievements during 2023 was the release of version 6.1.1, which is very robust and stable. It also brings a great function, namely Serial Commissioning, that will save our Partners a lot of time.\nIn terms of challenges and opportunities, KNX is a hybrid and customer-centric system, so with the arrival of matter, there is on-going work to standardise the way in which matter devices are integrated into a KNX installation. In addition, with the EU\u2019s Cyber Resilience Act coming, KNX Secure will become the standard solution to meet European expectations.\nLooking ahead, I just want to say that KNX has a great future. With the right strategic directions and focus (cybersecurity, the IoT, and energy management), KNX is ready to face current trends and challenges to make a better sustainable world. And stay tuned, because KNX Association is already preparing the next phase to make it unavoidable!\nJoost Demarest, CTO, KNX Association\nOne of the strengths of KNX lies in the fact that every product branded with the KNX trademark has had to go through third-party testing. During 2023, we invested heavily in preparing the test infrastructure for agreed system extensions, be it segment couplers, security proxies, KNX RF S-Mode Multi as well as now with high speed, completing the KNX IoT Point API system test templates. This is all to the benefit of KNX integrators and end users: certified interoperability!\nOver the past year,\u00a0I\u2019ve noted that questions on the availability of an alternative home automation protocol supported by the tech-giants have been growing, especially concerning the position of KNX on\u00a0this\u00a0matter.\nKNX continues to believe that its technology is the right solution for the professional market, where integration to the last detail of many applications from different manufacturers is the goal, be it in the home or the building.\nIn the coming year, the availability of the first KNX IoT products will undoubtedly be a game changer, especially since the KNX Classic system was unable to convince some manufacturers to also adopt KNX technology in their products. KNX Point API fully based on IPv6, and the start of the certification procedure for this kind of product, will open up a lot of doors that have been closed to KNX until now.\nMy message to the KNX community is that\u00a0KNX is continually striving to improve its technology, including the ETS design and configuration tool. We recognise how important it is that integration work for simple applications becomes easier, and in accordance with this, we plan to present the first results (code named \u2018smart linking\u2019) at the forthcoming Light + Building show in Frankfurt.\nHeinz Lux, CEO, KNX Association\nDuring 2023 I was thrilled that for the first time ever, KNX participated at the CES in Las Vegas \u2013 the home of the Smart Home! It was, of course, a great success. Other highlights for me have been the focus on energy efficiency and energy management\u00a0by KNX Associates and Members; the KNX National Group meeting which once again showed how important and energetic the international KNX community is; and the B2C activities of KNX Association in increasing awareness of KNX within the consumer market. Indeed I am more than proud of the great achievements of KNX Association staff in Brussels.\nI was also impressed by the startups who are driving the development and adoption of KNX IoT \u2013 the KNX IoT Startup Summer Pitch online event was excellent and helped forge new connections and exciting investment prospects in our vibrant community. KNX and Thread are also technology partners with a great future.\nFor the coming year, the focus for KNX Association will be on technology-driven sustainability; semantic communication; increased development of KNX IoT; and making KNX Secure standard for all KNX devices.\nMy message to the KNX community is that\u00a0KNX is 33 years young and still a rolling stone which has always defined smart home and building technology, and now defines future connected devices with semantic communication between smart home and smart building devices. We can look forward to KNX IoT and KNX Secure becoming standard in 2024, and I encourage everyone to embrace KNX-driven sustainability.\nI am so proud of all of the great technological and developmental achievements of KNX Members, the phenomenal projects of KNX Partners, the imaginative new KNX training offered by KNX training centres, the innovative research of our scientific partners, and the amazing activities of our KNX national groups. Together with the KNX Association staff in Brussels, we can look forward to another great KNX year in 2024!!!\nwww.knx.org\nYasmin Hashmi is the Editor of KNXtoday magazine.\nSPONSORS\nSMALL PRINT\nSHORT CUTS\nCONTACTS\nAll enquiries can be sent to info@knxtoday.com.\nKNX - THE STANDARD\nThe KNX Association is the creator and owner of KNX technology \u2013 the worldwide standard for all applications in home and building control.\nKNXtoday is edited by SYPHA.
