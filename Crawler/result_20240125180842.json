But even large companies with high security standards are not immune to the advanced techniques of professional hacking organizations.\nTop risks: Phishing, Faster Ransomware Attacks, AI Deployment\nTop risks such as phishing and faster ransomware attacks continue to dominate the threat landscape, according to T\u00dcV Rheinland experts. The growing number of connected devices exacerbates the threat of ever-increasing vulnerabilities. The use of AI takes the ability to exploit these vulnerabilities to a new level. New technologies are making cyberattacks more effective, while geopolitical crises are creating an environment of heightened risk. \u201cThe alarming increase in cyberattacks in recent years has made it clear that companies and institutions of all sizes should consider cybersecurity as a strategic priority,\u201d says Petr L\u00e1hner, Business Executive Vice President Industrial Services & Cybersecurity at T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nTen key trends for 2024\nT\u00dcV Rheinland\u2019s Cybersecurity Trends 2024 provide an overview of ten key trends that organizations need to prepare for.

        "raw_content": "Search:\nWhat are the challenges we face in an increasingly interconnected world?\nAs the world becomes more digitized and interconnected, the opportunity for attacks is greater than ever. Additionally, rising new technologies and geopolitical crises fuel cyberattacks and make them more effective. As a result, in 2024, the question for many will no longer be whether they will be hit, but rather when.\nStricter Legal and\nRegulatory Requirements\nNIS2, IT-SiG 2.0, NIST, CSA-iot, TEC, CLS and co.: Cybersecurity regulations create a common framework for increasing the resilience of targeted systems. With updated standards and guidelines, legislators are helping more companies increase their cyber defenses.\nOrganized cybercrime has attained an\nexceptionally high level of maturity\nThe cybercrime of the future will feature improved organizational structures, an increasing division of labor, and the formation of alliances and partnerships. We share how increased maturity and criminal team play make cyberattacks more successful.\nRansomware resilience\nRansomware remains the No. 1 threat and poses an enormous challenge to government, business, and society. Hence, resilience remains key in the coming year for those who want to protect themselves against the leading cause of cyberattacks.\nFormation of cybersecurity alliances\nBecause cyber threats cross borders and often require coordinated responses, joint defense alliances and coalitions of companies and institutions are becoming increasingly important. Learn how shared know-how can be effective in the defense against cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are threatening the\neconomic existence\nThe financial cost of cyber incidents and data breaches is higher than ever. And when there is a risk of significant financial, operational, legal, and reputational damage, under certain circumstances even the economic survival of a company may be at stake. Find out how high the total damage is.\nArtificial Intelligence enables more\nsophisticated cyberattacks\nAutomated mass attacks via phishing that are tailored individually to the targeted companies are becoming more and more common. We reveal how artificial intelligence plays into the hands of cybercriminals and how you can use AI to ward off attacks.\nSupply chain\nattacks\nVulnerabilities can also be exploited within the supply chain of a software or hardware product. In this case, malicious modules or components are integrated into the product by third parties or suppliers to outsmart the security mechanisms of the intended target.\nNumber of security vulnerabilities\nat a record high\nToday, more than ever, only those who know their vulnerabilities can effectively protect themselves from attacks. The drastic increase in the number of security vulnerabilities is therefore a particularly worrying trend, making vulnerability management a monumental task.\nMass connectivity\nCurrently, there are reportedly nearly 42 billion connected IoT devices, with the number expected to rise to 75 billion by 2035. And anything that is connected is vulnerable, which is why mass connectivity increases the attack surface by multiple times.\nAutomotive cybersecurity\nOur cars have long been driving computers. As a result, advancing digitization, autonomous driving and increased connectivity pose new challenges for cybersecurity. Learn more about the transition of the automotive industry.\nHow do you plan to navigate the growing cyber threat landscape?\nThese past few years have been a wake-up call for companies of all sizes as the number and severity of cyberattacks have been increasing in Germany and around the world. This alarming increase made executives more aware of the urgency of making cybersecurity finally a strategic priority.\nIn our increasingly interconnected and digitized world characterized by geopolitical tensions, the targets for attacks have expanded considerably. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which often underestimate their vulnerability, are being targeted in particular. And even large companies that already maintain high security standards are not immune to the advanced methods used by professional hacker organizations.\nTop risks such as phishing and faster ransomware attacks continue to dominate the threat landscape, while the growing numbers of devices connected to networks are adding more vulnerabilities, which further compound the threats.\nAnd with the use of AI, the ability to exploit these vulnerabilities is being propelled to a new level. It is no longer just connected end clients, IT and OT components, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are being targeted. Other industries, such as the automotive industry, must also protect their assets and software-defined vehicles against cyber threats better than ever before.\nBut what can you do if, in the worst case, your own economic existence is threatened by the impact of a cyberattack? Should you form alliances to share valuable security know-how and arm yourself against cyber gangs that are also increasingly working together? Or should you lean on the ever more stringent standards and regulations to help increase your own cyber defense capabilities?\nRegardless of what your answers are, our Cybersecurity Trends 2024 will identify the challenges you need to prepare for.\nCybersecurity at T\u00dcV Rheinland\nFor more than 20 years, the cybersecurity services provided by T\u00dcV Rheinland have been helping companies from various industries to securely use innovative technologies. In order to achieve this, we combine our cybersecurity expertise with a high level of industry know-how.\nYour benefit: Our cybersecurity solutions aim to combine security and data protection in an increasingly vulnerable world of connected systems and devices.

        "raw_content": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- T\u00dcV Rheinland, an international independent third-party testing, inspection, and certification organization, has issued \"Realistic Visual Experience\" certification for the flagship TVs developed and produced by TCL Industries Holdings Co., Ltd. at Consumer Electronics Show 2024. The certified flagship TVs are the QD-Mini LED 4K TV series, namely the X11G (85X11G), X955 (85X950, together with 134 other models), and C755 (65C757X2, together with 262 other models).\n\"Display technology has evolved over many years, successfully transforming the TV from a simple window for obtaining video information into a window for visual enjoyment of a vast array of video content. In this context, the ability of a TV product to truly replicate the visual experience in real-life scenarios is one of the key factors affecting user experience. As the currently popular new generation of display technology, the Mini LED TV has won the favor of consumers with its excellent picture quality experience. Since 2012, T\u00dcV Rheinland has established a solid partnership with TCL, and our two sides have carried out extensive and in-depth cooperation in the field of visual health. In the future, T\u00dcV Rheinland will continue to leverage its global advantages in technology, talent, brand, and resources, develop more new standards and technologies that meet consumer needs, provide comprehensive and professional services for TCL Industries, and help Chinese quality TV products and quality 'Made in China' lead the global market\", stated Frank Holzmann, Global Vice President of T\u00dcV Rheinland Business Field Electrical.\nBased on research into human eye perception of true colors, user visual experience, and various application scenarios, T\u00dcV Rheinland conducted tests on TCL's QD-Mini LED 4K TV series X11G, X955, and C755. The tests, conducted in accordance with T\u00dcV Rheinland's self-developed standard 2 PfG Q2860/03.23, evaluated peak luminance, checkboard contrast, ambient contrast, color gamut, color volume, luminance uniformity, color uniformity, and flicker-free display. The results demonstrate that the display performance of these three flagship TV series closely aligns with the actual visual experience of the human eye when observing objects. The related technology has reached a globally leading standard.\n\"Since 2018, TCL Industries has been dedicated to the development of Mini LED technology. After three generations of technological innovation, we have emerged as leaders in the Mini LED TV industry and have successfully launched the QD-Mini LED TV products in recent years. We aim to utilize this technology to deliver highly precise local dimming, and by harnessing quantum dot matrix control technology, we can make our TV products smarter. This allows us to provide users with truly smooth, uniform, bright, high-performance backlight TVs, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience. We are delighted that our three series of QD-Mini LED 4K TV products have passed the T\u00dcV Rheinland 'True Visual Experience' certification, further consolidating our leading position in large-screen flagship TVs and Mini LED display technology. Looking ahead, we anticipate broader cooperation with T\u00dcV Rheinland, enabling global users to enjoy pinnacle audio-visual technology from China and propelling 'China's high-end manufacturing' onto a wider global stage\", stated Zuo Bo, General Manager of TCL Industries Global Product Operations Center.\nAs a leading global technology service provider, T\u00dcV Rheinland has been deeply involved in the display field for decades, launching standards and certification services for various products such as low blue light, retinal protection factor, flicker-free, eye comfort, and global eye protection. It is committed to guiding the display industry to continuously improve technology and achieve superior performance, earning widespread recognition in the industry. In the future, T\u00dcV Rheinland will continue to join hands with TCL and other industry partners, solving key technical issues in the process of industrial development through industry-academia-research-application cooperation, ensuring the health, environmental friendliness, and comfort of display products, and jointly promoting the high-quality development of the display industry.\nAbout T\u00dcV RheinlandT\u00dcV Rheinland stands for safety and quality in virtually all areas of business and life. The company has been operating for more than 150 years and ranks among the world's leading testing service providers. It has more than 20,000 employees in over 50 countries and generates annual revenues of around 2.3 billion euros.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

With the wide application of anti-reflection products now being integrated into daily life, we must pay ever closer attention to the cost-effectiveness, user comfort, and visual effects of screen protectors. By cooperating with T\u00dcV Rheinland, we will continue to pursue and promote higher standards in anti-reflection products and lead the development of the industry.\u201d\nDuring the use of electronic devices, the screen will produce diffuse reflection or mirror reflection due to the influence of indoor lighting, outdoor light, and even the user\u2019s own image. This reflection significantly reduces the screen\u2019s contrast, color volume, grayscale, character clarity, etc., affecting the readability of information on the screen, thereby causing visual fatigue, distraction, or decreased concentration. Anti-reflection screen protectors reduce the reflection of ambient light and improve screen readability under various ambient light conditions by increasing surface roughness or applying an anti-reflection coating.\nT\u00dcV Rheinland has defined the standards for anti-reflection optical performance under normal use conditions, conducting tests from two dimensions, optics and durability, to ensure that a product can reduce the reflection of ambient light and be durable. The criteria include optical testing such as unwanted reflection against different ambient light conditions, Specular Component Included (SCI), haze, or luminous transmittance. The durability testing includes heat/cold environment, simulated surface cleaning with 75% alcohol, steel wool abrasion, and artificial skin scratch.\nThe testing results show that this anti-reflection screen protector from WTL Technology can significantly reduce interference from ambient light in different indoor and outdoor application scenarios, allowing users to view screen content more clearly and reduce visual fatigue.\nFrank Holzmann, Global Vice President of T\u00dcV Rheinland Business Field Electrical stated: \u201cIn October last year, we issued Recycled Materials Verified certification to WTL Technology\u2019s AQA screen protector. The issuance of Anti-Reflection Accessory certification demonstrates its unremitting pursuit of technological innovation and product upgrading. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation in the future. T\u00dcV Rheinland will continue to assist WTL Technology in researching new technologies, developing new products, continuously improving the user experience, and providing consumers with higher-performance, healthy, and eco-friendly accessory products.\u201d\nContact us for press inquiries:\nMichael Garc\u00eda Carbajal\nPhone: +52 55 3488 2108\nEmail: Michael.Garcia@mex.tuv.com"
