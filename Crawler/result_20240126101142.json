        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Their exceptional product innovations have garnered international acclaim, leading the way in tech trends and solidifying local R&D capabilities.\nBoth award-winning companies are graduates from HKSTP's Incubation and Acceleration Programmes.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way.
