        "raw_content": "The Korea Creative Content Agency - KOCCA\nThe Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) is a government agency that oversees and coordinates the promotion of the Korean content industry. KOCCA was established by the Korean Broadcasting Institute, the Korea Game Agency, and the Korea Culture & Content Agency. Therefore, the aim of KOCCA is to introduce Korean content to the world. Korean content such as Korean Dramas (K-Dramas), Korean Music (K-Pop), Korean Beauty, Korean Fashion, Korean Games, and Korean Animation just to name a few. KOCCA has played a major role in taking Korean culture & content globally. Furthermore, KOCCA has been incorporating new technologies for future projects and has been working with Korean startups to expand Korean content to the globe. Therefore, by working with Korean startups, KOCCA has access to new and innovative technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution.\nThe Rise in Demand for Korean Content\nThe Korea Creative Content Agency was created by the Korean government due to the rise of interest in Korean content. The global popularity of South Korea\u2019s cultural economy is called \u201cHallyu\u201d (The Korean Wave). The exporting of Korean pop culture such as TV dramas, movies, and music has played an important role in the growth of the Korean economy. Therefore the Korean government has played a major role in becoming the world\u2019s leading exporter of popular culture. In addition, they have been sending delegates to promote Korean content to countries all around the world.\nFor example, the Korean Culture and Information Service have set up over 30 Korean Cultural Centers in over 25 countries across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa to promote Hallyu. Now, it is estimated that Hallyu added an estimated $15 billion to the Korean economy.\nThanks to Hallyu, there has been a rise in Korean tourism. Furthermore, tourists from around the world come to Korea each year to experience Korean culture for themselves. Therefore, many Korean tour companies offer packages that include visits to famous K-drama shooting locations and various towns and resorts made famous by Korean movies, dramas, and K-Pop videos.\nCompetition for Korean Content Increasing\nKOCCA did an online survey back in 2019 to see which kind of Korean content is on the rise. The survey showed that K-pop and Korean drama fans around the world were willing to purchase Korean food, Korean fashion, and Korean beauty. There was a clear correlation between interest in Korean culture and Korean product consumption. Therefore KOCCA has been focused on creating the right content for its marketing strategy to help get Korean content into the US TV market on new streaming platforms. In 2023, expect to see a lot more Korean content starting with Netflix.\nNetflix has been putting a lot of money into gathering as much Korean content onto their platform as possible. In addition, SK Telecom has launched an OTT platform called Wavve in order to compete with Netflix. Kakao subsidiary Kakao M launched Talk TV in 2020 with a focus on short video clips. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus also made inroads into the Korean market in 2022. Therefore Wavve, Talk TV, and Netflix Korea will have more competition this year.\nAs competition has been getting more fierce among domestic and foreign online streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney+, Wavve, and TVing, demand for Korean drama has increased and there has been more investment in production. This trend has stimulated the diversity of Korean drama,\u201d said the General Director of Broadcasting, Do Hyoung Lee.\nThe Rise of the Gaming Industry in South Korea\nThe gaming industry in South Korea makes up 13% of the entire content industry in South Korea. It has been growing at a 6% rate year after year and the trend is not slowing down even during COVID. The gaming industry in South Korea reached over $16 billion in 2021. Therefore there is not only a high demand for game developers but more and more young Koreans want to work in the gaming industry in Korea. Therefore the gaming industry in South Korea will contribute a lot to Korea\u2019s job creation market.\nThere are globally competitive gaming startups in Korea in the online/mobile gaming industry that are also on the rise. Unicorn gaming startups such as NC Soft, Netmarble, Krafton, etc remain key players in the gaming market not just in Korea but internationally as well.\nKOCCA has been supporting the gaming industry in Korea for years. They have helped Korean gaming startups scale up through investments in their HR training and infrastructure. In addition, KOCCA is looking to develop Esports in Korea by incorporating the latest technologies such as VR and AR. With the adoption of 5G technology in Korea, look for new and innovative gaming startups to come out of South Korea.\nThe Rise of K-Animation\nKOCCA has been funding K-Animation for many years now through annual projects. Some of these projects offer funds of up to 2 million won ($1,700) for promising animations. Some of these animations have found success on streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Ghana\u2019s GHone TV, and the Chinese portal site Tencent. Since\nWhat is the Korea Creative Content Agency?\nKOCCA was founded in 2009 as a government agency that deals with policy and actions regarding the promotion of Korea\u2019s content industry. Their goal is to develop Korea into one of the world\u2019s top 5 producers of content. In doing so, they will play a vital role in creating jobs and improving the quality of life in Korea. Therefore KOCCA is in charge of supporting the development and production of Korean content. These forms of content include:\nKOCCA helps the expansion of Korean content to the global market. Therefore, they have created strategic bases for overseas business in Los Angeles, San Paulo, London, Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Shenzhen, Jakarta, and Tokyo just to name a few. They are continuing to develop new markets to promote Korean content. These strategic bases offer 1 to 1 business consulting, localization support, and overseas application. Furthermore, they help with the marketing of Korean content and products abroad.\nThe \u201cAge of Light\u201d Project in Gwanghwamun\nOne of the biggest projects for KOCCA for 2021 was the \u201cAge of Light\u201d project in Gwanghwamun. The project turned Gwanghwamun into a hub for history, art, and culture through 8 immersive works. The aim was to create a content \u201cRenaissance\u201d in Korea through immersive content that people can enjoy. It had the full support of South Korean President Moon Jae-in who said it was an essential initiative in Korea\u2019s K-New Deal Culture Content Industry Strategy.\nThe \u201cAge of Light\u201d Project turned Gwanghwamun into a playground that featured the latest tech advancements. It had VR, AR, AI, and holograms that incorporated 5G technology. The South Korean government allocated over $300 million through 2025 to develop immersive content and nurture over 1,400 professionals in the immersive content field.\n\u201cThe best way to heighten demand for something is to let people experience it themselves. So by creating a place where people can experience immersive content, we plan to \u201cimmerse\u201d people in immersive content at the center of Korea,\u201d said Kim Young-jun the President of KOCCA.\nImmersive Experiences at Age of Light in Gwanghwamun\nGwanghwa Media Canvas \u2013 This was a large-scale interactive LED panel media work installed outside the walls of the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History.\nInternational Events Hosted by KOCCA\nIn order to continue the rise of Korean content, innovation will be the key. Therefore, Korean movies, music, and cultural products need to continually innovate. This is where KOCCA will play a major role in the innovation of Korean content. In addition, KOCCA analyzes the latest trends and statistics and develops long-term strategies for the Korean content industry. Furthermore, it will be vital to continue to capitalize on the popularity of the Korean wave and keep its appeal to the global audience.\nKOCCA\u2019s Support of the Korean Startup Ecosystem\nKOCCA is very active in supporting the Korean startup ecosystem. They started CKL(Content Korea Lab) which helps entrepreneurs in Korea turn their ideas into startups. CKL is a platform that offers mentoring, networking, funding, and marketing for content creation startups. In addition, they offer open space and facilities to promote creative activities and form prototypes. They have different levels of support for each stage of a startup. For example, there is the Startup Farm, Content Startup League, and Startup Masters. To generate innovative ideas from entrepreneurs in Korea, CKL has created the Idea Fusion Factory which is a kind of imagination camp. In addition, KOCCA runs content creation training for teenagers, supports content-specialized high schools in Korea, and has an online Content Academy.\nKOCCA operates programs to support content firms to help Korean startups go global. Some of these firms include the Global Game Hub Center, Popular Culture & Art Support Center, CKL Business Support Center, CKL Planning Center, and the Story Creation Center (Ilsan Center).\nKOCCA Opens a Content Creator Support Center in Los Angeles\nKOCCA opened up a new facility in Los Angeles to support content creators, Korean artists, and business ventures in the US market. It is a support center that offers exhibition rooms, meeting rooms, and expert consulting for funding and business development.\nKOCCA\u2019s Support of Women\u2019s Rights Issues\nKOCCA signed an MOU with the Women\u2019s Human Rights Institute of Korea, the Korean Artists Welfare Foundation, and the Korean Film Council for their cooperation in creating education programs dealing with sexual violence and a hotline system for victims. In addition, KOCCA has started providing basic cultural education for teenage artists which includes sex-related issues.\nThe Future of Korean Content Exports\nSouth Korea\u2019s export of Korean content did not slow down in 2019. The export of Korean content reached close to $12 billion in 2019. This is an average annual growth of 16% over the past five years.\nThere are over 2,500 cultural content companies in Korea that employ over 650,000 people. Therefore, Korea knows the importance of content creation, content marketing, and content strategy. The world is changing and those changes are being determined by consumers. These consumers are what is driving the latest content trends. KOCCA hopes to enrich the lives of not only Koreans but people all over the world with creative content.\nNeed Help Breaking into Korea?\nPopular\nStartups\nKorean Fintech Startups Focusing on Invest-Tech\nStartups\nE-Commerce Solutions in Korea Helping Businesses Go Online\nStartups\nKorean Pet Startups Creating Innovative Products\nStartups\nKorean Cab-Hailing Startups Revolutionizing the Ride-Hailing Industry\nJohn is the Co-Founder of Seoulz.

KOCCA's overseas business centers support Korean content firms' foray into global markets by providing necessary information and holding promotional activities for K-content firms.\nAdditionally, KOCCA said a dedicated department for content intellectual property will be established to build a system for discovering and nurturing \"super IPs.\"\n\"IP spans across various genres and requires connections with diverse industries, (and making use of IP) requires intricate problem-solving (skills),\" said KOCCA President Jo Hyun-rae during a press conference held in Seoul on Tuesday.\n\"Therefore, we are creating a dedicated department with the responsibility to not only collaborate with other departments in KOCCA but also work with other institutions to vigorously promote IP (related projects),\" said Jo.\nKOCCA said it will also launch a review system under which internal experts will actively participate in selecting the recipients of the agency's various support programs. Currently, KOCCA periodically selects projects spanning diverse genres such as games, animations and drama series for financial support.\nFurthermore, initiatives to establish specialized content clusters in regional areas will be pursued in a bid to ease the concentration of content businesses in the metropolitan area, according to KOCCA.\nArticles by Lee Yoon-seo\nMore from Headlines\nThe Korea Herald by Herald CorporationCopyright Herald Corporation.

Beyond simple characters, the expansion of original character IP is emerging, such as creating various licensing products through collaboration with various companies. In addition, direct distribution is activated online\u00a0due to the prolonged COVID-19 restrictions, increasing the importance of the online and offline licensing market.\nWhat patterns are you seeing in the way audiences consume content and how does that influence the consumer product strategy?\nI think content is an area of individual taste and so, accordingly, consumption methods and patterns have become very diverse. When it comes to characters, collective character products are popular. Sellers have the advantage of re-purchasing existing products, and buyers have the better choice of collective toys with a long duration of enjoyment.\nWhat are Korean consumers looking for when engaging with a character?\nThere are cute images of the character, but it also seems to put meaning on the background that the character has. For example, in the case of \u201cKakao Friends,\u201d there are relationships and backgrounds between various characters, so each character\u2019s characteristics seem to be embodied and interested and allows consumers to connect and engage with the character.\nThat also plays into the Korean gaming market, which is one of the largest in the world. Why is that market growing so rapidly in the region and what are the trends that you are seeing in gaming and entertainment?\nGames and characters have an inseparable, positive synergy relationship. Various character IPs are being showcased in games. In the case of \u201cCookie Run,\u201d by Dev Sisters, was a very popular game in Korea; it\u2019s not only fun but also famous for characters. That therefore leads to an increased consumer products program around the IP.\nCan you talk about some of the key IPs in the region and tell us a little about why those resonate with fans, particularly from licensed consumer products perspective.\nThere are so many different character IPs in Korea. I think the key thing with the majority of the IP we work with is that they feature characters that men and women of all ages alike are able to connect and resonate with the various stories.\nWe will be showcasing IP from 16 amazing companies from Korea at Licensing Expo in Las Vegas in June. If you're curious about them, please come to the booths J192 and J206 and enquire.\nKOCCA will be showcasing IP from Aurora World Corp, Alimolistudio, Chungdahm Media, Devsisters Corp, EUNHUHOLDINGS, ICONIX, MESE, MONOVERSE, Qtizz, Roivisual, TOYTRON, Twin Spica, WOORI HOMESHOPPING, WHYJ contents, Korea Educational Broadcasting System and HWA HWA at Licensing Expo, which takes place June 13-15 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.\nFind KOCCA on booths J192 and J206.\nRegister for Licensing Expo 2023.\nRead more about:\nAbout the Author(s)\nIan Hart\nSenior Digital Editor U.K. & EMEA, License Global\nIan joined the License Global editorial team in May 2022 as digital editor for the U.K. and EMEA, becoming Senior Digital Editor in April 2023.\nIan is a huge fan of sports and entertainment brands and, as a father, toys and kids' brands are a large part of his life!\nHe has been at Informa (formerly UBM) since 2018, where he was previously the editor of SHP, a B2B digital publication aimed at health & safety professionals.\nIan studied journalism at university before spending seven years in online fantasy gaming.

KOCCA President Jo Hyun-rae announced that the budget will not only be used in strengthening the competitiveness of Korean content in the global intellectual property industry, but will also promote startups and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\u201cKorean content has made a significant development, but it faces many hurdles on the global stage and requires various strategies to respond to the fast-changing environment of content industry. Our agency narrowed down the major challenges and created strategies to support Korean creative contents,\u201d Jo said at the 2023 KOCCA Conference held at Coex in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul.\nJo shared plans to promote Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, and provide a better environment for workers in related industries.\nThe media content division saw its budget rise by 183 percent, the biggest increase among 15 divisions in the agency. While Korean print comics called \u201cmanhwa,\u201d animated characters and global business among other sectors saw on-year rises in their budgets, music and fashion business decreased 34.7 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively.\n\u201cRanging from research, development to production and distribution, the media content and animation division seeks to support the local creators from start to finish. The funding for media content in broadcast and local streaming services will be increased to 3 billion won,\u201d Kim Sang-hyun, general director of KOCCA\u2019s media content and animation division, said at the conference Wednesday.\nThe agency will assist small and medium-sized production companies with intellectual property issues, supporting creators to promote popular projects in the global content markets, including Hong Kong International Film & TV Market, The Spring International Television Market, International Production & Entertainment Content Market and Singapore Media Festival.\nThe agency will also continue its funding for the animation business and production studios.\n\u201cAlthough the outlook for 2023 seems tough, I believe the Korean content industry will grow and develop. I hope our strategies for next year provide appropriate support for the various sectors of the content industry,\u201d Jo said.\nArticles by Lee Si-jin\nMore from Headlines\nThe Korea Herald by Herald CorporationCopyright Herald Corporation.
