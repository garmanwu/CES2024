The demand for silicon anode materials is rapidly increasing in the expansion of the EV market. Using a smart silicon anode material production facility, Daejoo Electronic Materials responds flexibly to market demand.\nBy next August, Daejoo Electronic Materials plans to promote the initial project to build a smart factory at its Siheung plant in Gyeonggi Province. The Siheung facility for silicon anode materials was its first facility, and plans to upgrade into a smart factory.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials is the first in the domestic industry to mass-produce silicon anode materials and enhance its production capacity. When the facility will becomes a smart factory, it will be able to have a capacity of 3,000 tons of silicon anode material, which is the largest amount in Korea. This will greatly increase the automation rate of the silicon anode material manufacturing process, and will improve production efficiency and quality competitiveness simultaneously.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials\u2019s silicon anode material has 10 folds higher energy capacity than the existing graphite anode material. It is under the spotlight as a core material that can enhance the charging and discharging performance of EV batteries.\nThe silicon anode materials are growing at an average annual rate of 54% to meet the demand for EVs according to a market research firm. Daejoo Electronic Materials supplies anode materials with a silicon content of 5% to global auto manufacturers, and is developing products with a silicon content of 5%. This product was installed in the EV battery of LG Energy Solution. Daejoo Electronic Materials is increasing the production scale of its domestic business facilities in order to meet the demand for silicon anode materials. It plans to reach an annual production capacity of 3,000 tons by next year, and expand the capacity to more than 100,000 tons by 2030.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials is planning to expand investment for converting its facility into a smart factory.\nIt is expected that additional investments will be made to upgrade into the smart factory in order to expand production capacity.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials is enhancing its business competitiveness to develop silicon anode materials as a future growth engine. The company also minimizes the burden of production cost by directly producing raw materials for silicon anode materials, which is mostly produced in China.

They will increase their silicon anode material production capabilities fivefold by the end of 2024. The large-scale expansion is a measure to respond to the rising demand of EV batteries.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials decided to expand their current silicon anode composite oxide (Daejoo Metal Silicon Oxide, DMSO) production line with an annual production capacity of 2,000 tons to 10,000 tons by the end of next year and began investment. In addition to the 56.9 billion KRW announced through a recent public announcement, they made plans to increase their production capacity fivefold through additional investments next year. The total scale of investments is expected to easily surpass 300 billion KRW.\nSilicon anode materials are products that are drawing attention as next-generation battery materials. It expands the charging capacity and improves the charging efficiency of batteries to shorten the charging times of EVs and enable them to run longer.\nThey began to emerge as silicon anode materials were first commercialized in Porsche\u2019s EV, the Taycan. Daejoo Electronic Materials made the silicon anode materials, while LG Energy Solution made the batteries for the Taycan.\nCurrently, commercially available silicon anode materials contain about 5% of silicon. Battery and material companies are attempting to raise this ratio. With the development of 100% silicon \u2018Pure Silicon\u2019 as a leading example, such developments are being promoted to simultaneously improve EV battery performance and replace graphite, the main raw material of anode materials. This is because replacing natural graphite with silicon can help reduce the cost of batteries and improve resource dependency as well.\nDaejoo Electronic Materials has stood out since 2019, as they began to supply LG Energy Solution with silicon anode materials. With the demand for EV batteries soaring starting with 5% silicon anode materials, it is currently growing. The company sales which were around 150 billion KRW in 2020 grew to 190 billion KRW by 2021, and it is estimated to have exceeded 200 billion KRW last year. In the conductive paste-centered business structure, silicon anode materials are establishing themselves as a new growth engine. It is known that Daejoo\u2019s silicon anode materials have been applied to Hyundai Motor\u2019s IONIQ 6 as well.\nIt has been reported that Daejoo Electronic Materials plans to expand their production capacity to 20,000 tons by 2025 and 40,000 tons by 2027 as mid to long-term plan goals in step with market growth. An official of the company said that, \u201cWe plan on continuous investment.\u201d In addition to Siheung, where their headquarters are located, they are preparing to build a new factory in the Jeonbuk Saemangeum Industrial Complex. The construction of the factory in Saemangeum is set to begin this year.\nThe number of companies expanding into and increasing their investments into this field is increasing due to the growth potential of silicon anode materials. SK Materials Group 14, subsidiary of SK Materials specializing in silicon anode materials, recently began to invest in factory 2 before they began to operate factory 1, and POSCO Chemical and Hansol Chemical also threw their lots into the silicon anode material business.\nAlthough silicon is attracting attention as a replacement for graphite, it has the problem of its volume expanding by over 4 times when it comes into contact with lithium ions. The question of whether this can be solved will be considered a difference in technical capacity.\nReporter Ji-woong Kim (jw0316@etnews.com)\nDue to COVID-19 containment policy and US regulations\nExports to China last year were 1.37 billion USD\n40% drop from the previous year\nDomestic manufacturers also reduce facility investment\nSK Hynix, Operating Loss of 1.7 Trillion In The Fourth Quarter...
