The new gadget brings a lot to the table at a relatively low cost for the segment. Although it\u2019s arguably more functional with Apple products than with Android.\nThat\u2019s because Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is a smart lock that supports Apple\u2019s latest enhancement to the HomeKit experience with home keys capability. In fact, it\u2019s among the first. And that means, using home keys in Apple Wallet, users can tap to unlock the deadbolt with their iPhone or Apple Watch. More specifically, that\u2019s without the need to open any apps up. And that includes the ability to open up the lock even up to five hours after their iPhone battery funs out thanks to a feature called Power Reserve.\nWhat else makes Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt a great CES 2022 gadget?\nOf course, Apple-related features aren\u2019t the only thing worth noting here either. In fact, both the Schlage Home app and Apple HomeKit can be paired and managed simultaneously. So the deadbolt can also be used with Android gadgets. Including via Alexa and Google Assistant via voice commands, and at the same time.\nIn terms of other features, the Schlage smart lock announced at this year\u2019s CES event also packs everything the company\u2019s original smart lock did. Namely, homeowners can check the status of their locks remotely. And the deadbolt can, once connected to the app, be unlocked or locked remotely too.\nMoreover, activity logs are created for the lock, including individualized activity logs for up to 100 access codes. Complete with push notifications and access codes for sharing created in-app. And, of course, those codes can be set to provide permanent, recurring, or temporary access.\nPricing and availability\nSchlage has also laid out the pricing and availability for its new Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt, albeit not precisely in terms of location or launch date. The lock will become available in late spring. And it will come with an MSRP cost of $299.\nCopyright \u00a92022 Android Headlines.

        "raw_content": "Lockly is bringing Matter and facial recognition to your front door in 2024\nLockly makes some of the most intriguing smart locks on the market \u2014 including the premium Vision Elite and minimalist Flex Touch Pro \u2014 and now the company is gearing up to bring Matter and facial recognition to its lineup. Several new devices were revealed at CES 2024, including a Matter hub that\u2019s backward compatible with most existing Lockly products.\nThe Matter Link Hub is Lockly\u2019s first attempt at bringing the interoperability standard to its roster. By syncing your smart lock to the hub, you\u2019ll be able to integrate it with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and (for the first time) the Apple Home app. Best of all, you won\u2019t need to sacrifice any countertop space for the Matter Link Hub, as it connects directly to an electrical outlet and should take no more than a few minutes to install.\nLockly also revealed the Visage Smart Lock \u2014 a high-end smart lock equipped with facial recognition technology and support for Apple HomeKey and the Apple Home app. It\u2019s expected to work with Matter, though its certification is still pending approval. Other standout features include a fingerprint sensor, a digital keypad, the ability to issue temporary codes, and built-in Wi-Fi for remote access.\nWhile Lockly primarily focused on products designed for the average homeowner, the LocklyPro team \u2014 focused on commercial applications \u2014 debuted a new collaboration with Alarm.com. The Lockly Guard Deadbolt Z-Wave will allow users to control its performance remotely through the Alarm.com app. It will be available in two formats, allowing users to choose one either with or without a fingerprint scanner.\nThe Matter Link will be available sometime this year for $80. The Visage Smart Lock will launch this summer for $349, while release and pricing details for the Lockly Guard Deadbolt Z-Wave are yet to be announced.\nSamsung first revealed Ballie -- its rolling smart home hub -- at CES 2020. Now, at CES 2024, the adorable robot is making a triumphant return, this time sporting a new built-in projector. Samsung didn't have a physical Ballie roving around at CES, but the team showed off a home bot demonstration video, revealing how the robot has evolved over the years.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ballie, think of it as a roving smart home hub, capable of taking orders from you and syncing with the rest of your smart home. Along with dishing out commands to your connected gadgets, it can serve as a patrolling security guard, giving you a live stream of your home while at work or on vacation.\nKohler showed off a bevy of new products at CES 2024, including a luxurious lineup of new smart home gadgets, all of which are designed to transform your bathroom into a \"personal sanctuary.\" Along with updates to the Numi 2.0 smart toilet and high-end Stillness Bath, Kohler showed off a new fan, sink, and bidet, as well as smart valves and more.\nThe Anthem+ Digital Control was one of the most intriguing items at the Kohler booth, as can power nearly all aspects of your bathroom from a single control panel. Via its touch display, it allows you to control water, light, sound, and steam. All told, it can connect to 12 water outlets to power a variety of sprayers, showerheads, and body sprays.\nSegway -- the company responsible for Paul Blart's preferred mode of transportation -- already has a surprisingly robust smart home lineup. The company expanded its catalog at CES 2024, revealing a new series of robot lawn mowers (Navimow i Series) and a new portable power station (Segway Cube Series).\nThe upcoming Navimow i Series makes a few big improvements over Segway's existing H Series. Along with the ability to work without wires (which are typically used to set boundaries for the robot), the i Series employs a technology known as the Exact Fusion Locating System (EFLS). Segway says this will let the robot lawn mower better track its location and ensure it's cutting your lawn as close to specifications as possible.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
