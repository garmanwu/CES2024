        "raw_content": "From revolution to real-world value: How companies can benefit from Web3 in 2024\nIn 2023, the excitement of the grand metaverse dream\u2014a virtual, augmented-reality online existence championed by tech giants including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2014vanished. While the concept had gained early traction among tech enthusiasts, most consumers didn\u2019t get the appeal. As investors started pulling back on metaverse investments and flocking to generative AI, many business leaders were left questioning the broader value of Web3.\nIn short, Web3 is the vision of a decentralized, user-owned Internet built on three foundational technologies: blockchain (a distributed ledger); smart contracts (the ability to execute agreements without third party oversight); and tokens or tokenization (digital representations of assets, such as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, stablecoins, cryptocurrencies or tokenized real-world assets).\u00a0Despite the disillusionment of the past year, there are green shoots of value in this space, with a shift away from the casino mindset that pervaded in Web3\u2019s earliest days and toward chasing real-world value.\nThe\u00a0rise of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a real-life currency or asset,\u00a0which now tops\u00a0$130 billion in global circulation,\u00a0is enabling companies\u00a0to make transactions faster and cheaper. The digital exchange platform\u00a0Airtm, for instance, uses Circle\u2019s U.S. dollar-tethered (USDC) coin to deliver low-cost cross-border payments, saving up to 35% when paying remote workers.\u00a0Blockchain and smart contracts are enabling the\u00a0tracking and tracing of\u00a0materials\u2014from gold to airplane parts to carbon\u2014across complex ecosystems.\u00a0Tracr, a De Beers company blockchain,\u00a0now tracks more than 100,000\u00a0diamonds a month, roughly 15%\u00a0of the world\u2019s production. Brands such\u00a0as\u00a0Nike\u00a0and\u00a0Puma\u00a0are also demonstrating success leveraging Web3 technologies in conjunction with physical campaigns for customer engagement.\nThis quiet shift towards more practical, value-based applications of Web3 has led industry leaders like\u00a0Citi to estimate\u00a0that $5 trillion of central bank-issued digital currencies, or CBDCs, could be circulating by 2030, with tokenization of real-world assets approaching $4 trillion. That\u2019s a far cry from the Web3\u00a0obituaries that have been written over the past year.\nFrom revolution to real-world value\nThe early versions of Web3\u00a0were born out of a revolutionary ideology of insurgents with a vision of an alternative to established institutions. But the reality that has emerged is that Web3 is now being embraced by savvy incumbents, like JPMorgan Chase, Nike, and BlackRock,\u00a0and even being integrated into the fabric of existing institutions it was once meant to destroy.\u00a0The goal is now more practical: embedding Web3 technology in processes, assets, and value chains that aim to solve global problems that are not possible with Web2 alone.\u00a0(Web2 refers to the second era of the Internet, emphasizing user collaboration and interaction, with centralized ownership and control of data by major tech companies.)\nIn order to realize that potential, however, companies old and new first need to rethink how they approach Web3 and derive value from it. Many large companies are already engaged in this process. But many more companies of all stripes could and should be doing the same. For that to happen, their leaders need to update their Web3 understanding in three ways: 1) Web3 must be seen as an accelerator, not a replacement; 2) it must move away from general-purpose technology towards focused, value-proven use cases; and 3) ecosystem strategies must shift their focus from dominance to networked partnerships.\nAn accelerator, not a replacement\nThis key change in Web3\u2019s outlook as a means of enhancing current Web2 propositions and infrastructure means that instead of focusing on creating distinct virtual worlds such as Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds, Web3 needs to be embedded in companies\u2019 tech stacks and integrated into business strategies.\nThe Starbucks loyalty program Odyssey is a prime example of a modern Web3 loyalty program\u00a0embedded within existing journeys and real-world experiences. Odyssey members earn stamps (NFTs) redeemable for exclusive rewards, such as invitations to real and virtual events; the stamps can also be traded on NFT marketplaces. The beta program is\u00a0estimated\u00a0to have generated over $1 million in revenue, despite targeting only a fraction of Starbucks customers. That return, if extrapolated out, could mean tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.\nEnterprise tools are also increasingly integrating Web3 components to match companies\u2019 interest.\u00a0Salesforce\u00a0now offers smart contract templates, Web3 data models, and wallet risk scoring, to make it easier for companies to launch Web3 loyalty programs.\u00a0Solana Pay, a decentralized payment protocol, is providing customers near-zero-fee Web3-native payments through integrations with global commerce giants such as Shopify.\nAudius, a decentralized music streaming platform that\u00a0attracts between\u00a07 million and 8 million monthly users, has been successful offering a highly integrated, user-friendly experience that includes custodial wallets for fans operated by the company. Rather than expecting music lovers to be Web3 aficionados, Audius\u2019s CEO says the aim is for fans to get \u201cthe benefits of decentralization without having to be super aware of using a wallet.\u201d\nThere has also been a recent wave of interest in the convergence of Web3 and GenAI, as companies explore how blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger and decentralised digital identities could create greater trust in and verifiability of AI-generated content. Web3\u2019s recordkeeping of information could help determine whether content is human-generated or AI-generated.\u00a0Aptos Labs and Microsoft\u00a0are exploring the convergence of the technologies to determine whether training data is bias-free and whether LLM-generated outputs are authentic and trustworthy. Shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman announced the launch of new company,\u00a0Worldcoin, to provide \u201cproof of person\u201d digital identity for the AI age.\nArtists, meanwhile, are combining AI and Web3. Singer and songwriter\u00a0Grimes\u00a0has merged the two to allow users to transform their vocals into Grimes\u2019s unique vocal style. Resulting royalties would be automatically split\u2014using smart contracts\u2014between the collaborating artists and Grimes. The generative power of AI combined with the pay-out ability of smart contracts offer a powerful integrated solution.\nEmbedding Web3 technologies into Web2 infrastructure to enhance rather than replace existing propositions is essential to drive adoption. But for more widespread adoption, use cases must also be embedded within regulatory guardrails. New regulations, such as MiCA (EU Markets In Crypto-Assets Regulation), were launched in 2023, but stronger focus on regulation is needed for Web3 technology to proliferate more widely.\nMoving away from general-purpose use cases\nRather than being deployed as all-purpose use cases, Web3 is valuable when focused on specific scenarios where it adds to what Web2 alone can already offer. The best examples of Web3 applications moving from general-purpose to specific technologies are in the realm of tokenization. When NFTs first launched, they were used to drive speculative value, but had limited functionality. Companies flocked, creating NFTs with limited consumer value, and as a result the NFT market quickly crashed.\nWe now see investment shifting towards utility-based NFTs. Companies like\u00a0book.io\u00a0are using utility-based NFTs to transform ownership of digital content, such as e-books. Currently, when readers buy e-books, they don\u2019t own the book itself, only a license to view the content. That means they can\u2019t resell, lend, or give it away. In addition, authors have limited opportunities to take advantage of secondary market royalties. The advancements in NFT infrastructure and decentralized storage aim to address these problems.\nNFTs are also being used as proof of ownership for real-world assets including art and luxury collectibles. The platform\u00a0BlockBar\u00a0specializes in NFTs of luxury liquor brands that serve as proof of authenticity. The company\u00a0Arianee\u00a0allows brands more broadly to create digital product passports connecting physical products to a digital identity that can be tracked and traced.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0established companies such as\u00a0JPMorgan Chase now offer tokenized deposits to develop new trading, borrowing, and lending services through\u00a0blockchain platforms such as JPMorgan\u2019s\u00a0Onyx.\u00a0And fungible assets such as stablecoins are making it easier and cheaper to make virtual transactions. According to a\u00a0recent\u00a0report,\u00a0in 2022, stablecoins settled over $11 trillion worth of transactions onchain, almost matching the payment volume of Visa ($11.6 trillion) during the same period.\nChanging ecosystem dynamics\nThe rise and fall of Meta\u2019s metaverse vision showed that trying to exert market dominance while trampling ecosystem dynamics is counterproductive. To realize the benefits of Web3, co-opetition and partnership-building are essential. In 2024, we anticipate that more companies will adopt decentralized technology to advance solutions for collective, global problems. But what does that mean for a CEO looking to extract value from Web3?\nFor CEOs, when we think about the future, it\u2019s important to remember Web3 is no longer about technological disruption, but about co-optation of the new with the old to create infrastructure and ecosystems that solve problems jointly across a shared value chain. We\u2019re already seeing this assimilation across industries.\nOne example is\u00a0Project Guardian,\u00a0a collaboration between players across the global financial ecosystem, including policy makers and industry groups, to explore the feasibility of open, interoperable networks that enable digital assets to be used across global platforms for multiple use cases. This is an important step to jumpstart the move away from closed ecosystems with siloed use cases.\u00a0London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s recent announcement of a blockchain-based trading platform, after it had determined the public blockchain infrastructure was now \u201cgood enough\u201d to build on, is another indication that the nature of Web3 may be moving from private to more open, public infrastructure.\nWeb3 building blocks have the potential to address significant challenges in the carbon market, such as carbon credit credibility, standardization, and transparency across the value chain. Blockchain, smart contracts, and tokenization can contribute to providing the necessary global trading infrastructure to establish a unified, fluid carbon market. To make that happen, however, it is essential for participants in the ecosystem to come together across the value chain.\u00a0\u00a0Startups like\u00a0KlimaDAO\u00a0and\u00a0Toucan\u00a0are already in the market\u2014Toucan alone has tokenized over 20 million carbon credits, generating $4 billion in carbon trading volume\u2014and are being joined by incumbents like SAP, which is offering a \u201cgreen token\u201d using blockchain.\u00a0To truly unlock global value, however, we still need to see a more substantial shift in mindset to embrace ecosystem collaboration and open, public infrastructure.\nWhat now?\nThe reality is that Web3, including the metaverse, is not dead, but it is different. As we move from tech utopia to real use cases, having a clear strategy of when and how to use Web3 is important. Companies should look at how the building blocks of Web3 can enhance their tech stacks and business strategies, not replace them, and do this with a laser-focus only on use cases beyond what Web2 alone can offer.\nThere are key questions companies can pose to themselves to help assess if and how Web3 is needed.\u00a0Is there a deficit in transparency and trust that Web3 technologies, like blockchain, could address? Can Web3 mechanisms such as tokenization unlock liquidity where traditional methods have failed? In the age of unlimited content, how might utility-based NFTs and smart contracts ensure an effective digital asset ownership and reward strategy for creators and consumers?\nBeyond that, company leaders should rethink how they approach their ecosystem dynamics. Finding the right partners to build stronger network effects, from technology collaborators to industry peers and cross-industry stakeholders, will be vital for a strong ecosystem for success.\nRead\u00a0other\u00a0Fortune\u00a0columns by Fran\u00e7ois Candelon.\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois\u00a0Candelon is a managing director and senior partner at BCG and the global director of the BCG Henderson Institute.\u00a0Michael G.

But what technologies will spearhead this revolution?\nAn employee views trading screens at the offices of Panmure Gordon and Co (Carl Court/Getty Images)\nAn employee views trading screens at the offices of Panmure Gordon and Co (Carl Court/Getty Images)\nLong gone are the days of keeping rolls of cash under our mattresses. In our modern, mostly cashless society, we survive with all-powerful credit and debit cards and protect them with RFID-blocking wallets.\nContactless payments are only one facet of the digital economy \u2013 the corner of the global economy where economic activity is carried out online, accounting for e-commerce, digital banking, distributed computing and so much more. It\u2019s safe to say there is a revolution unfolding before us, and we\u2019re sitting in the front row seats. The World Economic Forum estimates that the digital economy will reach a valuation of $20.8 trillion by 2025. A whopping 40% increase from the $14.5 trillion in 2021.\nWith that, as we enter this new era of digital transactions, there is a rapidly growing emphasis on the capabilities of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are commonly referred to as asset classes by the mainstream, the underlying technologies of these coins are being used in many new and exciting ways.\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll look at the three most influential adaptations of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that have shaped the digital economy landscape and how they will mold our future.\n1. Tokenization of assets\nTo simplify, the buzzword \u201ctokenization\u201d refers to the process of converting an asset into a digital token. This digital token is a small piece of software code that lives on the blockchain and serves as a representation of asset ownership. It can be transferred between users without an intermediary.\nOne use case of tokenization is real estate, where the total value of a property is fractionalized and re-distributed in tokens. These tokens allow investors to enter the market and acquire certain portions of a property quickly and at a low cost.\nPut differently, tokenization can lower the barriers to entry, eliminate unnecessary fees and increase the liquidity of the underlying asset, all of which give investors much more flexibility and security with their investments.\nBeyond real estate, the tokenization process can also apply to just about any asset, such as securities (shares), precious metals, intellectual property, licensing rights, ticketing and fine art.\nSee also: Assets Will Be Tokens (And It Will Change Finance)\n2. The metaverse and artificial intelligence\nThe metaverse is a decentralized cyberspace that fuses the mechanics of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and the internet. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the functions that allow machines (our computers) to sense, understand, think, act and learn, just as we do.\nWhile the metaverse has a great premise to build upon, it is limited to the capabilities of current available technologies (and the lack thereof). This is where AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) \u2013 a subset of artificial intelligence \u2013 become a significant building block.\nIn short, greater investment in AIOps like big data analytics and machine learning will help build out the metaverse infrastructure needed to support additional users. This includes processing quadrillions of bytes of data per second, troubleshooting issues and restoring them, and ensuring security. Without it, it would be equivalent to navigating metropolitans without a map.\nOther than AIOps, the branches of AI that are integral to the development of the metaverse are Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI Bots, machine storytelling, creative AI and interface optimization.\n3. Improving privacy with Web3\nIt\u2019s no secret that our data and privacy are now at the mercy of Big Tech. It is largely up to these companies to decide what to do with our data, and we don\u2019t really have a choice but to play by their rules. This is the price we pay in order to access Web2, a term that refers to the internet as we know it today.\nWeb3 represents the next iteration of the internet, promising to intrinsically bring transparency, decentralization and ownership back to internet users.\nAt its core, Web3 is open source (anyone can modify it), trustless (no need for a third party) and permissionless (anyone can join). Simply put, it reduces the control any single party has over your data because it will be stored on a decentralized network instead of centralized servers.\nIn practice, Web3 technologies come in the form of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized apps (dapp), smart contracts, artificial intelligence as well as the metaverse.\nRead more: How to Build the Infrastructure of Web3 With Decentralized Data and Services\nExplore influential technologies in the digital economy at Consensus 2023\nSince 2015, Consensus has been the place to convene and discuss the future of some of the most promising technologies in the digital economy; cryptocurrency, blockchain, Web3, the metaverse and beyond.\nJoin us at Consensus 2023 this April 26-28 in Austin, Texas, to dive deeper into exciting new applications of cryptocurrency and its underlying technologies. The Money Reimagined Summit is ideal for institutional and retail investors, asset managers, venture capitalists, bankers, compliance officers, lawyers, custodians and anyone interested in exploring the future of the digital economy.\nTogether we\u2019ll explore rich new opportunities in the digital economy, address lessons learned from a brutal crypto winter and figure out where crypto solutions fit within the challenging post-pandemic global macro environment.\nDisclosure\nPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While we\u2019ve already seen some compelling use cases, these are a drop in the ocean compared to the flood of digitized assets that could move on-chain in the next few years.\nWhen will today\u2019s trickle of tokenization turn into a torrent? And what is holding it back?\nThis October, Forbes published a deep dive into the issue under the provocative headline \u201cWhy Tokenization is Failing.\u201d The author, director of digital assets research, Steven Ehrlich, provides a litany of failed or underwhelming digitization projects and concludes that the issue hindering adoption isn\u2019t technology, but trust.\nI beg to differ.\nYou\u2019re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\nThe primary reason why the tokenization market isn\u2019t in full flood is technical bottlenecks, limitations around current infrastructure and interoperability \u2013 an inevitable fact in a young, nascent space.\nThe last year, however, has seen incredible progress towards overcoming these issues. While it\u2019s easy to showcase the projects that didn\u2019t deliver, the true story of tokenization in 2023 is about the groundwork being laid that will enable the next wave of tangible on-chain results, driven by the might of major financial players entering the market.\nPrivate Equity Funds And Credit Are Leading The Charge\nSpeak to anyone intimately acquainted with the tokenization ecosystem, and they\u2019ll tell you that 2024 is full of immense promise. For starters, we see intense interest from private equity funds looking to develop new tokenization vehicles for their investors, even further, putting these ideas into production with haste.\nThis trend is set to continue into the New Year as TradFi titans, including Hamilton Lane and JP Morgan, develop tokenized funds. Inevitably, we\u2019ll soon see the development of even more structured instruments, including assets built from new revenue sources such as private credit - the logical next step for financial products that are inherently digital and relatively easy to migrate on-chain.\nThe Inevitable Expansion Into Other Assets\nThese instruments are just the start, though. The next generation of tokenized assets will include offerings like bonds and equities. In time, real-world assets such as art and automobiles, commodities, and fine wines will be traded on-chain. In fact, it\u2019s already happening, with use cases including fractional ownership of classic artworks.\nTokenized real estate, in particular, could be a significant boon for the market, which has traditionally been complex and slow-moving. Now, not only will these markets become digitally native, but they will also benefit from things like fractional ownership and near-instant settlement.\nThis stands to make investing more accessible and bring new liquidity into sclerotic markets. Entirely new generations of investors will begin to tap into the possibilities of tokenization and breathe new life into legacy markets. With new institutions and assets will come new payment rails, as well as the requirement for industry-wide standards that make all of these products and markets interoperable.\nNot only will this demonstrate the power and utility of tokenization, but it will also foster the trust that Forbes correctly identifies as the key driver of demand. In 2024, we can have every confidence that the flow of new tokenization will turn from a drip-drip into a deluge, marking the most profound revolution in financial affairs for centuries.\nEdited by Ben Schiller.\nLearn more about Consensus 2024, CoinDesk's longest-running and most influential event that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3.

By now, most of us are fully aware that everything we do online causes personal data to be generated and shared. The centralized nature of the companies and government agencies it passes through means they have total control over who sees it and what can be done with it. Even if we put trust in their privacy policies and compliance with regulations like GDPR, it doesn't eliminate concerns about data breaches and thefts.\nSome say that Web3, with its decentralized databases and blockchain-based apps, offers solutions. It promises enhanced privacy and security, giving us back control and ownership of our data. In theory, at least, Web3 tools and technologies, secured by encryption, are beyond the control or censorship of any single entity, including tech giants and governments.\nAlthough overshadowed by the buzz around generative AI in 2023, work on the next generation of web3 apps and technologies continues. Could 2024 be the year these innovations break into the mainstream? Let\u2019s explore the trends that will shape its trajectory over the coming 12 months and beyond.\nSustainability In Blockchain And Web3\nTop of the list of concerns must be the fact that blockchain and web3 technologies clearly have a sustainability problem. Computing using distributed and encrypted resources simply uses a lot of energy. At its peak in 2022, the Bitcoin\nBTC\nnetwork alone was estimated to consume the same amount of energy as Finland. In response, more efficient technologies, such as the Ethereum\nETH\nnetworks' proof-of-stake algorithms, have been developed, and green web3 initiatives have emerged. Regenerative Finance, for example, has emerged as a way of leveraging the technology for environmental and sustainable initiatives.\nSocial Web3\nWeb3 promises decentralized social tools that its champions say will lead to more private, censorship-free communications and networking, with users keeping control of their content and data. Transparent, open-source algorithms could help to track and block attempts at spreading disinformation, with policies administered democratically through blockchain-based voting mechanisms. We\u2019d probably have to look past 2024 to see something like this challenging the likes of Facebook or TikTok. But social tools like Mastodon that are built of decentralized principles are already emerging and growing in popularity, so I expect to see ongoing innovation in this space.\niOS 17 2 Is Coming Any Minute Now With Brilliant New iPhone Features\nGoogle Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages\nExpanding The Adoption Of Intelligent Technology To Catalyze Growth\nA Bitcoin Bull Run?\nCryptocurrency plays a big role in web3. It\u2019s no coincidence that many web3 projects fail when the price of Bitcoin crashes, causing funding to dry up. In 2024, another Bitcoin halving will take place, which traditionally has caused the value of the number one cryptocurrency to increase. Of course, I don't want to make financial predictions, but if it does happen, it will inevitably lead to an injection of funding and enthusiasm into web3.\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a term used for an emerging breed of financial services products built on blockchain and web3 technologies. Often, they are built around web3 capabilities of enabling peer-to-peer commerce and lending while circumventing \"middleman\" banks and financial institutions with their high fees. In recent years, these products have been attracting investment, meaning that in 2024, they\u2019re more accessible than ever.\nWeb3 And The Immersive Internet\nCall it \"metaverse,\" if you must. However, many web3 ideas are intrinsically linked to concepts of immersive online environments that mirror the real world. Web3 and blockchain technology have applications in online identity (such as avatars) and the creation of unique digital assets via NFTs. It can also be used to govern and administer online entities, from community groups to corporations, allowing members to democratically elect representatives and vote on the passage of rules and regulations. One prediction it\u2019s easy to make is that the web will continue to evolve to become more immersive in 2024, but we\u2019ll also get a better sense of what web3 will bring to the table.\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\nThese are essentially cryptocurrencies issued by central banks. Obviously, because they\u2019re under the control of the banks that issue them, they aren\u2019t decentralized. And they aren\u2019t supposed to be! Instead, CBDCs can be thought of as attempts to move the technology used to administer financial services onto blockchain infrastructure, where it can be managed more efficiently and transparently. China will continue piloting its digital yuan in 2024, joining other countries like the United Kingdom, Bahamas, Nigeria and Sweden that have launched or discussed plans for CBDCs.\nHigh-Profile Fraud and Other Crimes\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that a lot of fraudsters and criminals have made themselves famous (and often made a lot of money) in the crypto world that underpins web3. The FTX collapse and penalties handed out to Binance this year could just be the tip of the iceberg if the industry continues to grow at rates that some are predicting. With legislators dragging their feet, it's still very much a Wild West industry. So if you\u2019re going to be involved, be careful."

        "raw_content": "Web3 New Economy and Tokenization Whitepaper\nBy: HashKey Group\nExecutive Summary\nWeb3 refers to value networks represented by blockchain, which emphasizes data trustworthiness, data sovereignty, and value interconnection. In Web3, all values can be tokenized and efficiently, intelligently combined, transformed, circulated, and allocated in the Web3 value networks. These values have multi-level property rights implications, and in addition to ownership, the most important is the right to use. For example, only token holders of a certain blockchain network, system, or application have the right to use that network, system, or application. The core of the market for usage rights is stakeholder capitalism. Organizational forms will undergo significant changes, becoming open-source organizations, non-profit organizations, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). The tokenization of usage rights is the key to understanding the development of blockchain infrastructure in the past 15 years.\nIn the next 15 years, Web3 applications built on blockchain infrastructure will become the new focus of development and have a revolutionary impact on human economic and financial activities, social interactions, and privacy protection in the digital world. The Web3 new economy will create new money markets, capital markets, and commodity markets, requiring the use of different types of tokens as value markers for economic activities, including utility tokens, security tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing usage rights, ownership rights, and digital certificates, respectively. We call this the \"three-token model.\" In the Web3 new economy, the \"three tokens\" will fulfill their respective functions and fully utilize the stakeholder principle through incentive mechanisms.\nThe foundation for the healthy development of the Web3 new economy is in-depth research and continuous practice of tokenomics. In tokenomics, monetary policy, mechanism design, and financial engineering are a \"trinity\" relationship. The goal of monetary policy is to regulate token supply and demand, making the effective supply and circulation speed of tokens adapt to the development needs of the Web3 new economy. The goal of mechanism design is to achieve incentive compatibility through designing dynamic game-theoretic mechanisms and algorithms for decentralized decision-making to coordinate the actions of multiple participants under asymmetric information and inconsistent objectives. The goal of financial engineering is risk-return conversion, designing financial products and markets suitable for the Web3 new economy. The overall goal of tokenomics is to stimulate stakeholders to actively participate in Web3 new economic activities by reasonably designing token supply mechanisms, application scenarios, and related financial products and markets to promote token value growth.\nThe Web3 new economy will surpass the Internet economy in terms of the economic system, economic organization, financial system, value creation laws, value distribution laws, stakeholders, business models, distributed decision-making mechanisms, and value capture. Unlike the value capture feature of the \"thin protocol, fat application\" in the Internet economy, the Web3 new economy is \"fat protocol, fat application\". The underlying protocol stack of the Web3 new economy has built-in money systems and value systems, and value creation can be performed at the protocol layer. At the application layer, the Web3 new economy will integrate many digital technologies, and the space for value creation will be no less than that of the Internet economy.\n1. Outlook on the New Web3 Economy\n1.1. Web3: Underlying Logic and Evolutionary Trends\nSince the mid-19th century, driven by advances in communication technology (CT), information technology (IT), and digital technology (DT), humanity's digital migration has continued to deepen, and our ability to collect and process data has steadily improved. Data has become an unprecedented new driving force for the development of human society and economy, breaking through the limitations of physical time and space, restructuring economic laws, and leading business organizations towards openness, sharing, and collective governance.\nHumans are social animals, and the history of human development is also a history of network evolution: from the relationship networks of ancient tribes to various physical forms of public infrastructure networks, and then to the digital web. Networks have deeply influenced human work, life, social, economic, and political aspects.\nThe digital web is a highly efficient information exchange network that has developed based on the Internet since the end of the last century. The development of the digital web can be divided into three stages. Web 1.0 is an \"information network\" represented by portal websites. Users can easily obtain various online information, but in most cases, information dissemination is one-way. Web 2.0 is a \"data network\" represented by social media. Users create a large amount of content and leave behind massive data on online identity and behavior, and information dissemination becomes interactive. Web 2.0 platforms have generated enormous commercial value through the collection and analysis of user data but also created complex governance issues such as weak user privacy protection, platform monopolies, and unpaid use of news content. Web 3.0 is a \"value network\" represented by blockchain, emphasizing data trustworthiness, data sovereignty, and value interconnection. In Web 3.0, all values can be tokenized and efficiently, intelligently combined, transformed, circulated, and distributed in the Web 3.0 value network. These values have multi-level property rights meanings, and besides ownership, the most important is usage rights.\n1.2. The Market for Usage Rights\nThe importance of usage rights is most fully reflected in digital products and services. As shown in Figure 1, physical products can generally only be used by the same entity at the same time, and are accompanied by consumption, wear and tear, and depreciation during use. Digital assets and services generally have high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and non-competitive use. Digital products and services can be used by multiple people at the same time, which can have two effects.\nFigure 1: Comparison of Economic Characteristics between Physical Products and Digital Products & Services\nIn terms of supply, digital products and services have obvious economies of scale - the more produced, the lower the average cost. For example, developing software requires a high amount of investment, but the total cost will not differ significantly whether it is used by one person or one hundred million people after the software is developed.\nOn the demand side, the economic and social value of using digital products and services is greatly enhanced by network effects when multiple people use them. Kevin Kelly summarized this over 20 years ago as the \"fax machine effect.\" Suppose someone spends $200 to buy a fax machine. Once it is connected to a network of 10 million fax machines, he can exchange faxes with others and enjoy a network value that far exceeds the cost of purchasing one fax machine. Therefore, the fax machine also represents the right to use the fax network.\nFigure 2: Ownership and Usage Rights Comparison\nAlthough usage rights and ownership rights belong to different dimensions of property rights, they have significant differences. As shown in Figure 2, ownership is exclusive, and cannot be infinitely subdivided. Under the ownership system, a company's goal is to maximize shareholder value. This is known as shareholder capitalism, which is most evident in the stock market. Usage rights, on the other hand, are shareable and can be granted multiple times, mutually benefiting each other. For many digital products and services, usage rights can theoretically be granted an infinite number of times, and the path to expanding usage rights is through open source, open access, and permissionless systems.\nThe core of the usage right market is stakeholder capitalism. Organizational forms will undergo significant changes, becoming open-source organizations, non-profit organizations, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These organizations pursue the maximization of organizational value (or common interests). All participants in the organization collaborate on a large scale as stakeholders, making their contributions and sharing the value of the organization. In these organizational forms, ownership becomes insignificant, and usage rights are truly valuable. Although usage rights cannot be turned into equity, they can be tokenized.\n1.3. Blockchain Holding a Central Position in Web3\nOver the past 15 years, with the rapid development of the public chain ecosystem represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the underlying technology of blockchain has become mature. The blockchain development mechanism is rooted in the open-source community, embodying characteristics such as openness, sharing, and boundless innovation. Blockchain infrastructure is an important public product that is not owned by anyone or any institution. The distributed ledger of blockchain can extract usage rights from digital products and services, standardize and tokenize them in the form of tokens, and form digital asset markets. Digital asset markets can provide services such as issuance and trading of usage rights on a global scale. In terms of value capture, blockchain embodies the characteristics of \"fat protocols, thin applications.\"\nOver the next 15 years, Web3 applications built on blockchain infrastructure will become a new development focus and have a revolutionary impact on human economic and financial activities, social interactions, and privacy protection in the digital world. First, blockchain infrastructure protocols will be the basis for the development of Web3 applications, ensuring the effective operation of business activities on the blockchain through smart contracts. Second, Web3 applications will ensure their systems are trustless, open, transparent, and permissionless through decentralized governance mechanisms, with distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs) becoming the primary organizational form. Finally, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will serve as proofs of identity, capability, behavior, workload, contribution, activity, and product and service for Web3 application users. Based on these proofs, tokens will serve as incentive tools, establishing effective incentive mechanisms.\nWith clearer regulatory policies, security tokens will gain significant development. In the distributed economy built around Web3 applications, security tokens, utility tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will fully utilize the principle of stakeholder interests through incentive mechanisms based on their respective functions. The new Web3 economy will embed new economic and financial systems, creating economic and social value greater than the two organizational forms of profit-making corporate governance and open-source communities composed of volunteers. These values will be shared by holders of security tokens, utility tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In terms of value capture, Web3 is gradually showing the characteristics of \"fat protocols, fat applications.\"\n2. All values can be tokenized\n2.1. Re-understanding Token\nAll digital assets are essentially tokenized values based on blockchain technology. Technically speaking, they are tokens, including both fungible and non-fungible types. How can we understand the important role of tokens in the Web3 new economy? As early as the 1960s, when computer systems were first introduced, as shown in Figure 3, tokens represented permission to access and use computer systems. As the usage-permission tokens gradually evolved from the internet era to the blockchain era, usage permission was further standardized, fractionalized, and financialized, becoming tokens in the Web3 new economy. Tokens are a system for extracting usage rights from digital products and services and capturing value.\nFigure 3: Evolution of Token\nIn the Web3 new economy, all values can be tokenized. The basis of tokenization is the functions that are built into the blockchain, such as identity management, money and payment, asset registration, trading, and clearing and settlement. There are four main ways to tokenize. First, tokens represent usage rights. Second, NFTs represent proofs of identity, capability, behavior, workload, contribution, activity, and product and service, etc. Third, tokens represent off-chain values, such as central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, and tokenized green bonds. Fourth, tokens represent income rights, governance rights, or a combination of digital assets.\n2.2. The Real Value of Tokens\nFirstly, token issuance depends on a clearly defined algorithm model, where the key is to control the quantity and speed of issuance. The quantity limit and issuance discipline stipulated by the algorithm are the foundation of token consensus and trust mechanism, embodying the principle of \"Code is Law\".\nSecondly, tokens represent usage rights. Only those who possess tokens of a certain blockchain network, system, or application have the right to use it.\nThirdly, token circulation. Users consume some tokens every time they use a certain blockchain network, system, or application. Therefore, token circulation follows a deflationary model as a whole. For example, in Ethereum, the daily gas fee consumption has exceeded the daily issuance of ETH in the network, which has an important role in grounding the value of Ethereum.\nThe fourth is the security attribute of Token. In some blockchain applications, often the founding team not only utilizes the functional use of tokens but also the security use of tokens. For example, the founding team usually promises to use a portion of the project's cash flow income to repurchase the tokens circulating on the market, essentially transferring a portion of economic rights to token holders.\nThe fifth is the governance attribute of Token. In some distributed communities or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within blockchain networks or systems, Token is often used to transfer a portion of governance rights. Tokens are credentials for voting rights, and token holders can participate in community voting, decision-making, governance, etc.\n2.3. \u201cThree-token Model\u201d for the Web3 New Economy\nDue to their global nature, blockchain base protocols only require a \"one-token model\" for their built-in value capture system, with BTC and ETH being typical representatives. The Web3 new economy will generate new currency markets, capital markets, and commodity markets, requiring the use of different types of tokens as value markers for economic activities, including utility tokens, security tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing usage rights, equity, and digital certificates, respectively. This is the \"three-token model\".\nUtility tokens represent the right to use digital products and services. Only by holding the utility tokens issued by a network, system, or application can one have the right to use the relevant products and services. The more ecological applications and users there are, the greater the market demand for utility tokens. Utility tokens are also certificates for obtaining other rights. For example, a project team can lock an address holding a certain type of token as the target group and airdrop the project's governance tokens to that address. In practice, utility tokens can be given away as ecological points for free to incentivize users and launch the market. Utility tokens can be priced by secondary-market trading without financing activities such as \"issuance, sales, and subscription.\" The value of utility tokens comes from: 1. permission to use the network; 2. payment for gas fees and commissions; 3. companies repurchasing with part of their profits; 4. certificates of governance rights in certain communities; 5. priority for receiving airdrops and joining whitelists. Utility tokens are unit of measurement for network effects.\nThe founding team and early investors play a crucial role from the initiation to the implementation phase of a project. At this stage, if there are only utility tokens, it is not enough to incentivize the founding team, and the return on investment is not attractive enough to attract early investors. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce security tokens, which represent equity granted to the project team and early investors. In terms of economic nature, security tokens are essentially not different from stocks. Security tokens are not listed on stock exchanges but enter virtual asset exchanges through Security Token Offerings (STOs). STOs are sold on global networks such as public blockchains and are on the same trading platform as utility tokens, bringing together users and investors and usually achieving higher valuation levels.\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) play an important role in the authentication, permission, and proof of fully digital assets, and are the true \"digital certificates.\" NFTs can tokenize ownership of assets, enhancing their liquidity in secondary markets. NFTs can record contribution, activity, and behavior of stakeholders in the Web3 economic system, which can serve as a basis for rewarding stakeholders. In short, NFTs can connect everything, including Web2 and Web3, the real world and the virtual world, offline and online, digital twins and digital natives, users and communities, and consumption and experience. The value of NFTs comes from \"Play NFT to Earn\" and \"Play NFT to Own.\"\nIn general, the Web3 new economy is essentially a distributed network, where value is constantly generated, combined, transformed, circulated, and distributed. Utility tokens capture network value as usage rights in a distributed network. Some of the value is accumulated in enterprise nodes, and security tokens represent corporate equity. NFTs play the role of digital tokens in a distributed network.\n3. Tokenomics\n3.1. \"Trinity\" Methodology\nIn tokenomics, monetary policy, mechanism design, and financial engineering form a \"trinity\" relationship. The goal of monetary policy is to regulate token supply and demand, the goal of mechanism design is to achieve incentive compatibility, and the goal of financial engineering is to risk and return transformation.\nFigure 4: \"Trinity\" Methodology of Tokenomics\nAll token economies are influenced at the macro level by the supply and demand of tokens, at the micro level by the incentive mechanisms of stakeholders and cannot do without financial engineering methods in the design of financial products and markets. The research goal of tokenomics can be summarized as follows: to stimulate the active participation of stakeholders in Web3's new economy activities through the rational design of token supply mechanisms, application scenarios, and related financial products and markets, thereby promoting the growth of token value.\n2.2. Monetary Policy\n2.2.1. The Impossible Trilemma of Tokenomics\nIn the Web3 domain, innovation will mainly revolve around two \"impossible trilemmas,\" as shown in Figure 5. The first is the \"blockchain impossible trilemma,\" which refers to the fact that no blockchain network or system can achieve all three goals of decentralization, scalability, and security at the same time. The second is the \"impossible trilemma of tokenomics,\" which refers to the fact that no token economic model can simultaneously achieve the goals of free tradability, price anchoring, and independent issuance. The \"impossible trilemma of tokenomics\" is the key to understanding the sustainability and intrinsic stability of token economic models. In a sense, the breakthrough of the \"blockchain impossible trilemma\" is the fundamental driving force behind the innovation of blockchain technologies, while the breakthrough of the \"impossible trilemma of tokenomics\" is the fundamental driving force behind the innovation of tokenomics.\nFigure 5: Two \u2018Trilemma\u2019 in the Web3 Field\n2.2.2. Separation of Asset Function and Money Function\nIn the Web3 new economy, the price of tokens is influenced by factors such as ecosystem development, secondary market liquidity, and investor sentiment, causing fluctuations. If tokens are used as payment tools for economic activities, price fluctuations may inhibit the development of economic activities. Token price fluctuations may also lead to inherent instability within the tokenomic model.\nTo ensure the stability of the Web3 economic system, it is necessary to separate the asset function from the money function when designing a tokenomic model. Tokens that represent the asset function represent the share of participants in the Web3 new economy, intending to capture the value brought by economic development. Tokens that perform the money function can isolate the impact of price fluctuations of the former type of tokens on economic activities, allowing participants to focus on economic activities. In certain stages of the development of the Web3 new economy, there will inevitably be a situation where token prices fall, which needs to be avoided to prevent irreversible damage to economic activities, community cohesion, and so on. This way, when the market fundamentals improve, token prices can be restored.\nTokenomic models need to embed stability mechanisms: during the phase of token price decline, the participation cost of economic activities decreases, the economic activity increases, and the token issuance and circulation speed also decrease. This provides strong support for token value and prevents the occurrence of a \"death spiral\".\n2.2.3. Token Issuance and Circulation Mechanisms\nToken issuance and circulation mechanisms have a crucial impact on the stability of the tokenomic model. In the real world, the growth rate of the money supply is generally equal to the sum of the GDP growth rate and the inflation rate. In the Web3 new economy, the effective supply and circulation speed of tokens need to adapt to the development needs of the Web3 new economy. The core issues include: first, the initial issuance quantity and speed; second, the issuance speed after the appearance of secondary market prices; third, the relationship between token prices and mainstream or related tokens (i.e., token exchange rate model), and its impact on the economic model; fourth, token recycle, redemption, buyback, destruction, and deposition in usage scenarios.\nSeveral mechanisms can regulate the effective supply and circulation speed of tokens. Firstly, expanding the application scenarios of tokens so that some tokens are \"locked\" in application scenarios instead of being traded in the secondary market. Secondly, introducing a token-burning mechanism, such as automatically destroying the tokens that users pay in certain application scenarios. The token buyback mechanism is also very important, and the buyback speed can be non-linear or accelerated to achieve deflationary effects. Thirdly, the staking mechanism essentially regulates token liquidity across different periods. In the short term, staking will \"freeze\" a portion of tokens, but in the long term, these tokens will be released, and the staking yield will vary with the issuance of new tokens. If the fundamentals of the Web3 new economy can improve during the staking period, the liquidity of the tokens released in the long term can be absorbed.\n2.2.4. Mechanism Design\nEvery rational economic actor participates in market activities based on self-interest, but individual pursuits of self-interest may go against collective interests or affect the overall goals of society. If there is a mechanism design that can make each participant's pursuit of self-interest maximization coincide with the goal of maximizing collective interests, this mechanism design is incentive-compatible.\nFigure 6: Core Principles of Token Mechanism Design\nAs shown in Figure 6, incentive compatibility is the core principle that tokenomic model designs must follow. Only by satisfying the incentive compatibility condition can collaboration be promoted in a decentralized and trustless environment, where the individual interest of participants aligns with the collective interests and prevent community fragmentation due to unfair incentives.\nIn the Web3 new economy, there are significant differences among participants in terms of psychological factors, cognitive biases, and behavioral tendencies. Therefore, achieving perfect incentive compatibility in mechanism design is difficult. It is imperative to design dynamic game mechanisms and algorithms to support decentralized decision making and coordinate the actions of multiple participants with asymmetric information and inconsistent goals.\nIn the \"three-token model\" of the Web3 new economy, mechanism design has significant practical value. Security tokens are subject to securities regulation and must meet securities regulatory requirements or exemption criteria in their issuance and trading. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the Howey Test to determine whether digital assets have securities attributes. The Howey Test consists of four criteria: investment of money, in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others. In the design and use of utility tokens, in addition to not touching on the four criteria of the Howey Test, it is best to distribute them for free in the form of ecological rewards. In this case, before the utility tokens enter the secondary market, their starting price cannot be determined based on past financing, but a Dutch auction can provide guidance for the starting price. Dutch auctions are conducted on the blockchain in an open, transparent, secure, and decentralized manner. Whether utility tokens can be listed on exchanges can also be decided by quadratic voting mechanisms.\n2.2.5. Financial Engineering\nTokenomics uses financial engineering methods to transform risk and return, with 5 main objectives: First, to support resource allocation across time and space; Second, to design corresponding financial products according to different scenarios and user needs; Third, liquidity management, especially to reduce liquidity costs; Fourth, asset pricing; Fifth, risk management.\n4. Web3 New Economy's Surpassing of the Internet Economy\nIn terms of economic systems, economic organizations, financial systems, value creation and distribution rules, stakeholders, business models, decentralized decision-making mechanisms, and value capture, the Web3 new economy will surpass the Internet economy.\n4.1. Economic System\nFrom the perspective of property rights and profit distribution systems, economic models can be divided into the \"Main Street Model\" of the industrial economy, the \"Silicon Valley Model\" of the Internet economy, and the \"Shared Capital Model\" of the Web3 new economy.\nThe \"Main Street Model\" ha a centralized property rights structure and capital profits were enjoyed individually, resulting in the emergence of numerous big capitalists in this stage.\nIn the \"Silicon Valley Model,\" property rights are decentralized, and the scope of capital is expanded. Capital is no longer limited to the amount of funds available, but knowledge has also become an important form of capital. Entrepreneurs attract venture capital with business plans and realize the monetization of knowledge. The \"Silicon Valley Model\" is no longer a monopolistic capital and exclusive profit distribution model but instead, through shareholder capitalism, ownership and profit can be shared.\nThe \"Shared Capital Model\" is a more advanced model than the \"Silicon Valley Model.\" All stakeholders can share all the value created by economic or business organizations.\n4.2. Economic Organization\nUnder the \"Main Street Model\" and \"Silicon Valley Model,\" economic organizations are usually centralized companies. When companies first emerged, they mainly adopted top-down decision-making mechanisms and had a U-shaped structure. With the diversification and globalization of corporate economic activities, business units and regional units gradually emerged, and the power of the group headquarters was gradually decentralized, presenting an M-shaped structure in terms of the overall architecture.\nThe \"Shared Capital Model\" essentially inherits the M-shaped structure of corporate organizations and gradually forms a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) form, distributing organizational rights or benefits to stakeholders through tokenization.\n4.3. Financial System\nThe Web3 new economy may have two sets of capital market systems. The first one is shareholder capitalism based on industrial and internet economies. The financial activities of shareholder capitalism are shown in Figure 7. Companies raise funds from the market through equity financing, and equity represents the standardization and financialization of ownership of the company. Holding equity entitles one to receive the company's profit-sharing and governance rights.\nFigure 7: The financial activities of shareholder capitalism\nThe second type is stakeholder capitalism based on the Web3 new economy. Shareholder capitalism emphasizes ownership and uses equity as incentives to encourage the establishment of new companies and businesses. Stakeholder capitalism emphasizes usage rights and uses tokens to represent stakeholders' share of rights. The financial activity form of stakeholder capitalism is shown in Figure 8. Tokens are standardized, shareable, and financialized usage rights in the open ecosystem. Holding tokens means having the right to participate in the governance of the open ecosystem and the right to use digital products or services in the open ecosystem.\nFigure 8: The Financial Activity Form of Stakeholder Capitalism\nShareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism can be integrated. As shown in Figure 9, there will be some corporate nodes in the Web3 new economy. Corporate equity is not only a compliant financing channel but also provides incentive mechanisms for the founding team and early investors. Corporate shareholders can transfer part of their interests to utility tokens in the corporate ecosystem, and utility tokens can leverage the network effect to promote the development of the corporate ecosystem. As long as the network value enjoyed by shareholders is greater than the benefits transferred, both shareholders and utility token holders will benefit. Utility tokens can be used to launch the market through non-financing issuance, representing the right to use and govern the ecosystem, and capturing value from the open ecosystem.\nFigure 9: Integration of Shareholder Capitalism and Stakeholder Capitalism\n4.4. Law of Value Creation\nThe Industrial economy pursues the maximization of company value, the Internet economy pursues the maximization of shareholder interests, while Web3 new economy pursues the maximization of organizational interests.\n4.5. Law of Value Distribution\nThe Industrial economy has high fixed costs and increasing marginal costs. Therefore, the pricing model of the Industrial economy is basically cost-based pricing and there can be no free model.\nFor the Internet economy, the free model dominates, and the saying goes \"The wool comes from the sheep, but it is the dog that pays the bill.\" The reason why it is free is that the Internet economy has the characteristics of high fixed costs, but decreasing marginal costs that tend to zero. However, internet products that appear to be free may actually be more expensive than manufacturing industry products. This has also created some internet companies with a market value of over one trillion dollars.\nThe value distribution in the Web3 new economy follows a fair, just, and transparent distribution mechanism, allowing stakeholders to share profits.\n4.6. Stakeholders\nThe business model of the Web3 new economy is described as \"Player to Earn\", where \"Player\" refers to stakeholders, including developers, creators, contributors, consumers, investors, etc. All participants will be players in Web3.\n4.7. Basic Business Model\nThe classic business model of the Web3 new economy should be \"Play NFT\" and \"Earn Token\". As mentioned earlier, NFT is a proof of contribution, and Token is a standardized and shareable right to use. Usage rights can be traded on the secondary market to monetize the value of contributions.\n4.8. Decentralized Decision-Making Mechanism\nThe decision-making mechanism of the Web3 new economy is decentralized. The purpose of decentralization is not to resist censorship, reject compliance or refuse regulation, but to introduce a fairer decision-making mechanism through digital technology. In the balance between efficiency and fairness, the Web3 new economy's business scenarios need to find a suitable balance point.\n4.9. Value Capture\nThe value capture of the Internet economy is usually referred to as \"thin protocol, fat application,\" while the Web3 new economy is \"fat protocol, fat application.\" The difference between fat and thin lies in the ability to capture value.\nThe core of the Internet is the TCP/IP model, which allocates network addresses through the IP protocol and relies on the TCP protocol for communication. The Internet protocol lacks a value capture system, which makes it unfriendly to protocol layer developers in terms of economic incentives. The Internet application layer relies on \"surveillance capitalism\" to capture a lot of value from user data and attention (including users passively watching advertisements pushed by Internet platforms).\nThe Web3 new economy's underlying protocol stack includes money and value systems, which can create value at the protocol layer. In the application layer, the Web3 new economy will combine many digital technologies, and the space for value creation will be no less than that of the Internet. Both the Web3 protocol layer and the application layer are based on token-based distributed economies, essentially market networks where participants trade directly, and economic value is shared by stakeholders.\nThe commercial value of the distributed economy is not reflected in shareholder equity but is inherent in the market network and ultimately reflected in token value, which is positively correlated with the magnitude of economic activities. The token-based distributed economy has strong network effects. The increase in user base leads to a higher increase in the value of the distributed economy (n^2 order of magnitude) compared to centralized businesses (linear order of magnitude).\nClick here to download the pdf.\nshare :\nDon\u2019t\nMiss Out !\nSubscribe now to receive notifications of our articles and newsletters:"

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nThe Top 5 Things You Must Know Midway Through Davos 2024\nSandy Carter, Author, at Davos\nNestled amidst the stunning vistas of Davos, over 800 CEOs, 1,600 companies, and representatives from hundreds of nations converge to engage in pivotal conversations about emerging technologies and their profound implications for businesses and global economies. The atmosphere is electric with spirited debates and the level of public-private collaboration is unparalleled.\nMidway through Davos, I've selected the top 5 discussions that are essential for staying abreast of the game-changing trends in technology!\n1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on jobs present a complex picture.\nRecent research by the IMF, titled \"Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work,\" indicates that AI could affect up to 40% of jobs worldwide, with the number rising to 60% in countries like the United States and dropping to 26% in low-income countries. The influence of AI is double-edged: on the positive side, it has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and serve as a tool for entrepreneurs, facilitating innovation and idea generation. Conversely, there is a risk of job displacement. The development and application of AI should not be accepted as predetermined; policymakers have a crucial role to play in shaping its trajectory. Given AI\u2019s disregard for national borders, international collaboration is essential. Ensuring that labor policies align with these technological advances is critical to realizing AI's net benefit for humanity.\nAs Ray Wang, Davos speaker and CEO and founder of Constellation said to me \"Organizations must recognize the gravity of their role in the era of artificial intelligence. It's not just about leveraging AI for efficiency and profitability; it's about taking prescriptive and proactive steps to build a foundation of trust and safeguard reputations. As we navigate this technological revolution, the onus lies on institutions and the AI community to demystify AI, clarifying its tools and uses. Education is paramount. It's our collective responsibility to ensure that as AI transforms the workplace, it also opens doors for job creation and up-skilling, ensuring that the evolution of work is inclusive and beneficial for all.\"\nRay Wang on the Live from Davos Disrupt TV!\nAI is poised to transform the global economy, particularly within labor markets. Advanced economies might encounter the effects of AI more rapidly than their emerging market and developing counterparts, attributed to their workforce's concentration on cognitive-intensive tasks. Exposure to AI varies, with women and those with higher education often being more vulnerable, yet potentially standing to gain the most from AI advancements. Conversely, older workers may find it challenging to adapt. If the synergy between AI and high-income earners is substantial, labor income inequality could rise, as could wealth inequality through increased capital returns. However, substantial productivity gains could elevate income levels for the majority. Amidst this transition, it is imperative for advanced and developing economies alike to invest in regulatory frameworks and labor reallocation strategies that protect those at risk, and to emphasize the development of digital infrastructure and skills.\nBitcoin Will Never Be \u2018Money\u2019 Precisely Because It\u2019s Nothing Like Gold\n3 Best Gold Stocks To Buy For 2024\nJPMorgan s Jamie Dimon Says He Won t Talk About Bitcoin Anymore After Trashing It One Last Time\n2. Redefining Leadership for the Era of Emerging Technologies like AI, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing\nIn an ever-evolving technological landscape, leadership must evolve to keep pace with advancements in AI, blockchain, and quantum computing. At recent discussions in Davos, I was thrilled to engage in conversations about how our new world necessitates a transformation in leadership styles. It's clear that cultivating a culture where employees feel secure about the impact of AI on their organizations is crucial. Additionally, comprehensive training on emerging technologies is no longer optional but essential. It was refreshing to see culture and leadership becoming focal points for CEOs, government leaders, and entrepreneurs at Davos.\nA significant insight shared about AI was the endorsement of a deliberate and calculated approach to innovation. The prevailing opinion is that a slow and steady progression ensures the establishment of a robust foundation for responsible AI development. This methodical path includes the formulation of explicit ethical standards, the development of a highly skilled workforce, and the construction of the necessary infrastructure to underpin this rapidly expanding sector. By adopting this approach, we can proactively tackle potential issues, ensuring alignment with the overarching objective of sustainable and ethical development in AI.\nRhonda Vetere, a speaker at Davos and Global STEM Ambassador, Board of Directors, emphasized the need for a new breed of leadership. \"The traditional C-suite leadership model is now outdated. In this age where life and leadership are not mere transactions, it's imperative to lead with empathy and recognize the astonishing rate at which everyone is adapting to technological change. Remember, people are the priority. Invest in your team. It's vital to proactively disseminate frameworks for upskilling and career development,\" she remarked.\nRhonda Vetere at Davos 2024\nLeaders today must not only be visionaries in technology but also champions of human capital. They must commit to nurturing talent, sharing knowledge, and creating pathways for continuous professional growth. Only through such a holistic approach can we fully realize the potential of our technological advancements and the individuals who power them.\n3. Tokenization and it\u2019s power.\nThe consensus at Davos is clear: tokenization stands as a pivotal topic for 2024. But what exactly is tokenization? It is the process of converting the rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain, thus facilitating its trade and ownership digitally.\nThroughout various panels at the event, tokenization was heralded for its potential to enhance productivity and efficiency in our increasingly digital world. A compelling application is the tokenization of satellites, which offers a shared approach to costs and expenses.\nShelli Brunswick, a panelist at Davos and CEO of SB Global, emphasized the transformative impact of this innovation: \"Tokenization, or fractional ownership of space assets, can open doors for developing nations, academic entities, and small businesses, potentially triggering significant advancements in workforce development and economic growth.\"\nShelli Brunswick at Davos 2024\nThe tokenization of satellites also offers a novel solution to the growing challenge of space debris. By assigning and tracking ownership of space assets through blockchain, responsible behavior in space can be incentivized. This approach not only promotes sustainable use of space but also aligns with the broader goals of environmental responsibility and international cooperation in space governance.\nThe discussions also ventured into the realm of agriculture, highlighting the tokenization of food products to ensure traceability and origin verification. This transparency extends to the manufacturing sector, where it can be used to certify the sustainability of materials, allowing retailers to validate the eco-friendly nature of their fabrics with confidence.\nFurthermore, tokenization is not just a tool for improving transparency and collaboration; it is increasingly seen as a mechanism for enhancing security and creating new investment opportunities. For instance, with the advent of more sophisticated cyber threats, tokenization provides a secure and immutable record of asset ownership and transactions. In the financial sector, the potential for tokenized bonds and stocks is being carefully examined, with several panels highlighting pilot projects that could redefine investment and liquidity in the markets. Such innovations could give rise to a new era of democratized finance, where a broader range of investors can participate in markets that were traditionally less accessible.\n4. AI and Open Source: Bridging Gaps for Efficient Deployment\nAI and the debate around to Open Source or not continued at Davos. During a session at the MIT Dome, Aditi Joshi from Google\nGOOG\nCloud shared insights on the development and deployment of machine learning (ML) models, highlighting the obstacles to their broader application. The high computational demands of ML models present a significant barrier, especially given infrastructure and resource constraints. A further complication is the lack of standardization in ML deployment, leading to a patchwork of compatibility issues linked to specific frameworks, hardware types, and applications.\nAditi Joshi, Google, at Davos 2024\nThe extensive efforts developers must undertake to ensure models work across various hardware setups can be challenging. Developers must invest considerable time and effort to ensure that models built on specific frameworks function correctly across different hardware setups, requiring specialized knowledge. These complexities impede developer productivity and limit the potential of ML models in terms of architecture, performance, and versatility.\nIn response to these challenges, a consortium of leading ML industry stakeholders, including tech giants like Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Apple\nAAPL\n, and innovators like Hugging Face and Intel\nINTC\n, has initiated the development of OpenXLA. This open-source compiler and infrastructure ecosystem is designed to bridge the compatibility gap between ML frameworks and hardware. Its goal is to boost developer productivity by facilitating seamless deployment across a variety of hardware backends, including GPUs, CPUs, and specialized accelerators. The consortium's focus on high performance, scalability, portability, flexibility, and affordability aims to ensure efficient and cost-effective deployment of ML models.\nFor business leaders, your engineering and developers will need to consider how to develop and deploy.\n5. Space the Davos Frontier.\nSpace had a big stage at Davos. At the Hedera\nHBAR\nleadership dinner, there were Astronaut whispers and there was a full day dedicated to space as well. Tonight I\u2019m in a round table on Space with AI and Tokenization! In the modern era of technological innovation, space has emerged as a new frontier akin to the influential gatherings in Davos, where global leaders converge to shape the future. This cosmic domain is no longer the sole province of governmental space agencies; it has become a crucible for private enterprise, technological advancement, and innovative financial models. Two pivotal forces driving this transformation are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the tokenization of space assets, like satellites.\nAI's role in space exploration and utilization is multi-faceted. From optimizing satellite trajectories to analyzing vast amounts of cosmic data, AI is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool. One of the most groundbreaking applications is in autonomous spacecraft operation. AI enables spacecraft to make real-time decisions without Earth-based control, crucial for deep-space missions where communication delays are inevitable.\nIn satellite technology, AI enhances Earth observation capabilities. By processing and interpreting data at an unprecedented scale and speed, AI facilitates more accurate weather forecasting, efficient resource management, and timely disaster response. This leap in data handling and analysis is not just a technical upgrade; it represents a paradigm shift in how we understand and interact with our planet and beyond.\nDavid Bray, a Davos keynote speaker and one of \"24 Americans Changing the World\" by Business Insider, told me that \u201cWe are experiencing simultaneous tech revolutions in the commercialization of sensors, AI, space, biology, and quantum. We *must* ways to empower and uplift communities locally, regionally, and globally in ways that don\u2019t exacerbate tensions, divisions, and even more disinformation; rather business, governments, and non-profits together must develop and activate more people-centered tech adoption approaches to co-create shared futures ahead.\u201d David is hosting a roundtable at Davos around Space tech and emerging technologies.\nIN SPACE (Photo by SpaceX via Getty Images)\nAs space becomes the new Davos frontier, the integration of AI and tokenization is not just an incremental step but a giant leap. It paves the way for more inclusive, sustainable, and efficient space exploration and utilization. The future of space is not just about reaching new celestial bodies; it's about harnessing cutting-edge technologies to create a space economy that is accessible, accountable, and advances humanity.\nThe Future:\nThe Future: Davos is not just a spectacle of present-day thought leadership; it is a signal for future perspectives. The dialogues of Davos serve as a catalyst for change, inspiring innovation and fostering collaborations. As we depart from the snowy peaks that have housed these pivotal discussions, the imperative to not only envision a better future but to lay down the practical groundwork for its realization is perhaps the most valuable takeaways from this year's gathering."

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Novel approaches are critical to regaining or maintaining digital trust and ensuring the long-term sustainability of Web 3 tokenization infrastructures.\nThis proposed pioneering deep tech-powered\u00a0Web3 Trifecta\u00e2\u201e\u00a2\u00a0can prepare and secure business leaders' market and strategic positioning in a highly competitive, volatile global ecosystem.\nIn the exponentially evolving Landscape of Web 3.0, tokenization stands as a pivotal force, offering decentralized and transparent systems. Digital trust for Web 3 tokenization could be accelerated by deploying this deep-tech trifecta, which leverages the combined capabilities of edge computing, quantum computing, and digital twin technology.\nThis article underscores the global landscape reshaping Web 3 tokenization with increased investments, the rise of converging technologies, and population demographic shifts, highlighting the profound impact and challenges associated with this transformative journey, ultimately paving the way for future research directions. The combined deployment of edge computing, quantum computing, and digital twins for Web 3.0 tokenization marks a groundbreaking exploration into the synergistic benefits of these three cutting-edge technologies.\nThis novel and unrivaled\u00a0Web3 Trifecta\u00e2\u201e\u00a2\u00a0represents an avant-garde endeavor, pushing the boundaries of decentralized systems by leveraging the unique capabilities of each component. Edge computing enhances real-time processing and reduces latency, quantum computing fortifies security against evolving threats, and digital twins introduce transparency and automation. This unprecedented integration is a testament to the commitment to innovation within Web 3.0 tokenization.\nGlobal Landscape\nThe global Landscape of Web 3.0 is witnessing unprecedented investments, fueled by the convergence of cutting-edge technologies and a dynamic population demographic. Investors increasingly recognize the potential of decentralized systems, propelling tokenization into the forefront of technological innovation. The global\u00a0Web 3.0 Market\u00a0is projected to grow from USD 0.4 billion in 2023 to USD 5.5 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 44.9% during the forecast period, according to a new report by MarketsandMarkets\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. Web 3.0 signifies a profound shift toward a more decentralized and democratic Internet ecosystem. A diverse demographic further accentuates this convergence, with digital natives driving the demand for secure, efficient, and transparent digital ecosystems.\nAs highlighted by a World Economic Forum Report, 2023 witnessed the increased tokenization of assets, marked policy changes, and expanded mainstream use cases. One of the landmark developments was the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF), the\u00a0World Bank, the\u00a0Bank for International Settlements\u00a0(BIS), and Switzerland's Central Bank collaboration designed to explore the leveraging of tokenization technology to streamline financial processes and enhance global economic development. Furthermore, The World Bank and OECD reports have also signaled a profound recalibration and reconfiguration of the Web 3 and digital assets ecosystem.\nThe Web3 Trifecta's Impact of Edge Computing, Quantum Computing, and Digital Twins on Web 3 Tokenization\nIn Web 3.0 tokenization, edge computing emerges as a powerful tool, enhancing processing capabilities the network's periphery. This paradigm shift reduces latency, ensuring real-time execution of smart contracts and facilitating seamless token transactions. The integration of edge computing mitigates the reliance on centralized servers, fostering a more robust and resilient decentralized ecosystem.\nQuantum computing injects an unprecedented level of security into Web 3.0 tokenization. Its cryptographic algorithms and capabilities to process vast datasets enable the creation of quantum-resistant cryptographic mechanisms, fortifying the infrastructure against potential threats. Quantum-resistant tokenization algorithms ensure the longevity of digital assets in an era where classical cryptographic methods may be vulnerable to quantum attacks.\nDigital twins, replicating physical and digital entities in real-time, could introduce a new dimension to Web 3.0 tokenization. These virtual replicas could enhance tokenized ecosystems' transparency, traceability, and accountability. Smart contracts, executed through digital twins, automate complex processes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. This symbiotic relationship between tokenization and digital twins optimizes resource utilization and streamlines supply chain processes, augmenting the overall effectiveness of decentralized systems.\nChallenges\nThe design and deployment of an unparalleled Web 3 trifecta might be challenging but will be needed. Legal and regulatory frameworks will need to adapt to the decentralized nature of these systems, addressing issues related to ownership, liability, and dispute resolution. Standardization and governance mechanisms must be established to ensure interoperability and scalability across diverse platforms. Scalability, a perpetual concern, demands innovative solutions to accommodate the increasing volume of transactions without compromising efficiency. Customized KPIs and OKRs will have to be designed, deployed, and monitored to improve the performance of Web 3 tokenization platforms continuously.\nOpportunities\nA dual cyber-ethics approach can be a powerful strategy to gain, regain, or sustain digital trust. Zero-trust cybersecurity, characterized by continuous verification and strict access controls, forms the backbone of this approach. Scrutinizing every interaction mitigates potential threats and reinforces the security perimeter. Innovative ethics approaches such as Swarm Ethics\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 leaning on collective and decentralized applied swarm intelligence can also secure systemic digital trust via an agile, robust, resilient, proactive, organic, and shapeable value system. Simultaneously, a proactive zero-trust cybersecurity model complements these ethical advancements, offering a robust defense against cyber threats. The convergence of zero-trust cybersecurity and innovative, ethical approaches establishes a resilient Web 3 trifecta, instilling confidence in digital ecosystems by prioritizing security, accountability, and ethical considerations. As technology advances, this dual approach becomes indispensable in optimizing data governance and redefining and maintaining digital trust.\nLatest Research Highlights and Future Research Directions\nResearch published since 2023 presents a nuanced exploration of Web3 from diverse perspectives. For example, Ray's comprehensive review thoroughly analyzes Web3's background, technologies, applications, and future directions. Guan et al.'s ecosystem approach, published in the \"Journal of Electronic Business & Digital Economics,\" outlines a systematic review and research agenda, emphasizing the interconnected elements of Web3. Liu et al.'s contribution to \"IEEE Network\" explores the challenges and opportunities inherent in Web3 technologies. Nicholson et al.'s work investigates the transformative intersection of blockchain and quantum cloud in the Web3 era.\u00a0 Another recent paper introduces Web 3.0 as a decentralized internet driven by blockchain, semantic communication, edge computing, and AI. The article proposes a blockchain-based semantic exchange framework. This framework tokenizes semantic information into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for fair and efficient interactions, utilizing a Stackelberg game and Zero-Knowledge Proof for privacy-preserving trading. A case study on urban planning illustrates the proposed mechanisms, highlighting the potential challenges and opportunities in leveraging semantic extraction and communication within Web 3.0.\nThese papers contribute a deeper understanding of Web3's evolution, challenges, and potential breakthroughs.\nAs the trajectory of Web 3.0 tokenization unfolds, future research directions will have to focus on refining legal frameworks to accommodate decentralized models, fostering global acceptance and collaboration. Advanced cryptographic algorithms resistant to classical and quantum threats will need to be developed. Research endeavors should also concentrate on establishing robust international web 3 tokenization standards and customized governance structures that facilitate seamless interoperability among decentralized networks. Scalability\nand sustainability should be focal points to meet the growing demands of decentralized ecosystems, ensuring the sustained evolution and maturation of Web 3.0 tokenization infrastructures.\nReferences\nRay, P.
