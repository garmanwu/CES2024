        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water.

This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.

        "raw_content": "The best products and ideas at CES 2024 | The DeanBeat\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nThe CES 2023 tech trade show is finally over in Las Vegas, after a grueling six days for me and crowds that numbered perhaps around 130,000.\nI walked around a lot to find the coolest tech. At or ahead of CES 2024, I recorded around 80 press events, interviews, and sessions. I walked 46.78 miles, or 105,407 steps, over six days compared with 38.81 miles (or 87,447 steps) over five days a year ago. My feet hurt and my back is sore.\nI wrote 67 stories ahead of and during CES and I moderated one panel. I recorded 96 sessions, interviews and product descriptions. I have a lot more stories to write. This story is about the coolest tech I saw in Las Vegas. If you had some FOMO from not going to the show, maybe this list will help fill you in on the good stuff at the show. There are 19 products and projects from CES here, as well as updates on products I\u2019ve seen in years past.\nI don\u2019t know about you. But I felt like this was an amazing year for new technology, triggered by refinements in old ideas as well as the gift of generative AI.\nNow it\u2019s time to analyze and make some sense of this. I hope you like these ideas, whether they are concepts or finished products.\nHere\u2019s my list from last year at CES 2023 and the year before at CES 2022.\nThis year featured nearly 3,500 exhibitors, up from 3,000 exhibitors in 2023, and down from 4,000 (in-person) in 2020. Despite occasional warnings from security guards, I dragged my roller bag all over the place. Here are the things that caught my eye.\nSupernal S-A2 eVTOL air taxi\nHyundai\u2019s Supernal showed off its latest design for an air taxi at the CES 2024 tech trade show in Las Vegas this week.\nAir taxis and flying cars have been making a splash at CES for years now, but it\u2019s encouraging to see a big company like Hyundai taking it seriously and moving forward with designs. I thought it was the most interesting thing I saw at CES this year.\nThe Supernal air taxi is an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOL. The S-A2 is a second-generation design. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai unveiled its first S-A1 eVTOL program at CES in January 2020.\nThe aircraft will take four passengers. It can cruise at 120 miles per hour, and it has eight rotors that can rotate. It has four in the front of the wing and four in back to balance itself in a vertical takeoff. The engines will be quiet at 45 decibels during flight and 65 during takeoff or landing. That\u2019s as quiet as a dishwasher. It can go from zero to 60 miles per hour during takeoff.\nThis year, the company showed off a VertiPort, or a concept for the places in Los Angeles where you could catch an air taxi. As a division of Hyundai Motor Group, the company is not just developing an aircraft. It\u2019s creating a mobility solution. Neil Marshall, head of manufacturing and program management at Supernal, told me it\u2019s creating a mobility solution. The all-electric air taxi will have a range of 25 miles to 40 miles, with each trip taking just minutes instead of an hour in a car.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new form of taxi, a new form of mobility,\u201d Marshall said.\nThe trips will be short hops to places like downtown Los Angeles or Woodland Hills, long enough to skirt traffic in a 40-minute ride, but likely needing a ride-sharing solution to complete the last mile from the VertiPort to the rider\u2019s final destination.\nRather than make a flying car, Marshall thinks the rideshare car and the air taxi make for a better solution for mobility given the infrastructure that\u2019s already in place. At first, you\u2019ll make reservations for air taxis. But at some point, you\u2019ll just be able to go and catch the flights that are maybe 10 or 20 minutes apart.\nMarshall also showed off the proposed control room where air taxi traffic would be monitored and managed.\nThe air taxis need an air traffic solution, and they have to stay out of commercial air space for airports like LAX. So they will follow the routes of roads, making it easy to stay on course and out of the way of other air taxis. A flight from Universal Studios to Woodland Hills could take 38 minutes, flying over the roads. But it could take more than an hour at peak times in a car.\nSupernal is talking to the FAA and NASA about how to establish the routes properly. The air taxis will have to share the air with devices like drones. Marshall ultimately believes an air traffic control system that is not dependent on human controllers will be the best solution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about developing an aircraft,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s about developing a mobility solution. We\u2019re looking at the first mile and the last mile.\u201d\nAir taxis going one way will be able to fly at one elevation and those going another could fly at a different elevation. The elevation will likely be in the 1,500 feet range.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much each ride will cost yet. But Marshall said it could start service as early as 2028.\nClinatec brain-computer interface\nWhen it comes to a brain-computer interface, Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink isn\u2019t the only show in town. Clinatec also showed off its research at CES Unveiled during CES 2024. The research organization brings together multidisciplinary experts to treat neurological diseases and restore motor functions for those who have had brain or spinal accidents.\nClinatec is a biomedical research center at Polygone Scientifique in Grenoble, France, with biologists, nanontechnology experts and more. Clinatec was developed by the research division of France\u2019s CEA, Inserm and Universite Grenbole Alpes.\nThe biomedical research center in Grenoble, France, has developed a non-invasive brain implant that rests on the surface of the brain and helps restore electrical communication in areas of the brain that have been damaged, said Abdelmadjid Hihi, deputy director for scientific affairs and partnerships at Clinatec, in an interview with me.\nThe cerebral implant records neurological activity and it mimics the signals for making muscles work, said Hihi, who has a doctorate in biological sciences from Lausanne University.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on brain implant technology,\u201d said Hihi. \u201cThe concept is that it is possible to use brain activity that corresponds to movement intent to help people who have severe movement impairments.\u201d\nFor instance, someone with a spinal cord injury may not be able to move. Clinatec tries to record brain activity with a system that is bio-compatible and has electrodes which can send signals out of the brain. Those signals are then decoded in real time by machine learning algorithm-based software, Hihi said.\n\u201cAnd then this information was decoded is recorded into machines that can help people walk again or grasp again, or hear again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically use this system initially with people who had accidents.\u201d\nHe showed a video of an injured man taking steps with the help of an exoskeleton, and the man is able to do this with signals stimulating both the brain and the muscles. Clinatec has also worked with people who are paraplegics, giving them stimulation for the muscles to make them function.\nThe work has been going on for more than 10 years, and the first patient got an implant more than six years ago. France supports the research through a grant, and in the future Hihi said the group wants to work with those who have had strokes and need rehab.\nThe brain accepts the implant because it consists of bio-compatible materials that are tested before implantation. It doesn\u2019t go inside the brain tissue, but sits on top of it so it reduces inflammation and fibrosis. It makes me think of William Gibson\u2019s sci-fi short story Johnny Mnemonic.\nDexcom Stelo glucose monitor\nBack in 2020, I wore a Dexcom G6 Pro glucose monitor to see what it would be like to have to monitor my blood sugar as if I had diabetes. I am on the border of that condition, but like many millions of Americans I\u2019m at risk if I start to let me weight get out of control. Now Dexcom has something new in the Stelo.\nMy interest came out of being a tech narcissist. I\u2019ve been interested for years in how technology can deliver a \u201cquantified self,\u201d or data about myself and how I live. It measures sleep and steps, but what does it really tell us? In the case of a glucose monitor, it tells you the kind of foods that can send your blood sugar into high or low states. For those with Type 1 diabetes, this is a life-or-death situation requiring frequent insulin injections. They have to make sure their blood sugar stays within an acceptable band or they risk fainting or even death.\nAs I agreed to test the monitor, I realized that I was going to get a glimpse inside my body that most people never get a chance to do. I could look at what I was doing and what I was eating and figure out what the effect was on my blood sugar.\nI was astounded to learn that eating a big pile of spaghetti was one of the things that could push my blood sugar level off the charts and even put me above the 180 milligrams per deciliter threshold that doctors considered to be high.\nIt\u2019s not just the highs that can be bad news. At the same time, when I went for a jog, I found my glucose levels dropped so much that it dipped below 70 milligrams per deciliter and triggered alerts for me, as if I were in danger of fainting. The lows, known as hypoglycemia, can lead to hunger, trembling, heart racing, nausea, and sweating. When I was out of range, I got a notification on my iPhone.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Dexcom Stelo is that it is designed for Type 2 diabetes patients who don\u2019t need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don\u2019t always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nGlucose monitors measure the level of sugar in your blood. For diabetic patients, this is critical.\u00a0Diabetes affects more than 34 million Americans\u00a0and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. The traditional standard of care for glucose monitoring has been a fingerstick meter, which is painful as some patients need to test their blood by pricking their fingers up to 12 times a day.\nIn a patient with Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can\u2019t produce the hormone insulin, which helps the body absorb sugar and remove it from your bloodstream. For Type 2 diabetes patients, their body may not be able to produce or process insulin effectively. Either condition means people have to inject themselves with insulin to take their glucose levels down. But they can only do this if they can accurately measure their blood sugar levels in real time, something that hasn\u2019t been possible or convenient until recently.\nStelo will be a wearable device that sends data to your smartphone and has sensor that can last for 15 days.\nThe pricing will depend on insurance, but the company made the monitor so that it will be affordable for people who don\u2019t have good coverage.\nIt will have a cash pay option for those who don\u2019t have insurance coverage. The good thing is that Moore\u2019s Law is bringing down the cost of these devices.\nStelo is in the midst of getting FDA clearance and it could launch later this year.\nNvidia and Convai show AI characters in a ramen shop\nNvidia and Convai showed off another cool demo with AI characters in the ramen shop. The owner of the shop, Jin, is a non-player character with a realistic-looking avatar that you might find in any video game. In the past, AI showed off a limited demo of this scene. But I was able to do a 20-minute demo where I was able to test the generative AI in just about any way I wanted.\nPreviously, Nvidia and Convai created an amazing demo of the tech with a realistic ramen shop and its characters Jin and Kai. Now Convai showed off the next evolution in AI-driven character technology, which gives characters the ability to hold realistic conversations with players in games. This conversation showed off four different dynamic AI models.\nJin is powered by generative AI, as is his friend Nova, a cybersecurity expert who is a customer in the ramen shop. They were joined by me, playing as the character Kai. I had an open-ended conversation with them. Seth Schneider of Nvidia ACE and Purnendu Mukherjee of Convai guided me.\nIt starts with micro services from Nvidia ACE called ASR, or automatic speech recognition. It takes your voice and turns it into text. Nvidia puts that into a large language model, which can generate the response for the character. Then it has to be piped into a text-to-speech model, and then that has to be fed into a lip-sync program that matches the character\u2019s lip movements to the voice. All of this has to happen in real time, and I only detected a slight delay, perhaps second-long.\nNova and Jin could have talked among themselves and I could have listened in to that conversation as a fly on the wall. But we skipped that part of the demo when it had a hiccup. Jin did say that making ramen was an art. So I just started asking questions.\nThe latest from Convai empowers users to engage NPCs dynamically, seeking real-time responses and actions. Characters now execute complex tasks, fetch items, and initiate interactions with other NPCs. Even during idle moments in the game, Convai-enabled NPCs engage with each other, expanding the spectrum of their interactions and perceptions within the virtual world.\nDesigned to integrate seamlessly with game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, Convai\u2019s latest iteration redefines the behavior and responsiveness of AI-driven characters within interactive environments.\nThese NPCs now possess enhanced spatial awareness, dynamic character actions, and the ability to engage in meaningful interactions with their environment and other characters. Beyond scripted responses, Convai-powered characters navigate complex instructions, showcase emotional awareness, and participate in organic interactions. It has the potential to reshape the landscape of gaming narratives.\nIn a strategic partnership, Convai integrated Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) modules, specifically Nvidia Audio2Face and Riva. This integration enhances the realism, believability, and responsiveness of character interactions.\nNvidia ACE is a suite of technologies leveraging generative AI to bring digital avatars to life. Audio2Face facilitates industry-leading lip sync and facial animations, while Riva delivers high-quality, low-latency speech-to-text capabilities.\nConvai\u2019s technology enables developers to swiftly customize NPC backstories, personalities, and knowledge, granting NPCs the ability to respond uniquely and adapt dynamically. Through an intuitive playground or programmatically via the API, creators witness their characters embody spatial awareness and execute a myriad of actions, offering an unprecedented level of dynamic conversation.\nI asked Nova if she had any interesting cybersecurity cases lately. She asked if I had something interesting. I asked about the hack against Insomniac Games. She said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure but I can look into it if you want.\u201d I wondered if it was all the leaked info was real. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say but leaks like that usually have at least a grain of truth to them.\nI turned to Jin and asked if he could recommend some ramen. He suggested Shio ramen for something light and miso ramen for something adventurous. I ordered the miso ramen. I asked him how the crime in the neighborhood was. He noted how it\u2019s a rough neighborhood but now he has Nova on his side. But he said we don\u2019t talk about the fear of organized crime.\n\u201cJust enjoy your ramen and let the city do its thing,\u201d he said.\nI asked him about the good luck cat on the wall and he told me how it brought good luck. He also talked the most expensive bottle of sake in the shop. He noted how old man Tanaka told his life story from start to finish in six hours. I asked what was the most interesting part, and Jin said it was when Tanaka claimed he saw a real ghost.\nThere was one moment where I went too far and Jin let me know it. I asked how much money the ramen shop makes in a week, and he said that was private information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say the shop does alright and leave it at that,\u201d Jin said.\nConvai had set the aggression level pretty low for Jin, so he didn\u2019t sneer at me with his answer. That was a short conversation, but it was pretty amazing considering it was AI doing the talking.\nAI comes to your laptop\nMicrosoft\u00a0is adding an AI easy button to the Windows keyboard. It\u2019s the first significant change to the Windows PC keyboard in three decades.\nIt\u2019s a sign of the times and a lot of companies announced they would be adding it to their new desktops and laptops coming out this year, making 2024 the \u201cyear of the AI PC.\u201d\nMicrosoft added that the addition will be a big step towards \u201cmaking 2024 the year of the AI PC.\u201d The news comes after Microsoft\u2019s September announcement\u00a0that a new version of Windows 11 would have Microsoft\u2019s AI companion Copilot as part of the operating system. The PCs are coming in late February and through the spring, and they will be on Microsoft\u2019s own Surface devices.\nIntel joined the party by announcing its new Core Ultra processors would have neural processing units, while Advanced Micro Devices said it has already shipped more processors with NPUs on them already. These machines can run machine learning tasks on the local machine, resulting in tasks that are faster, use less battery and are more secure than running them from the cloud.\nHP, Asus, Acer, Lenovo and a bunch of other companies announced PCs with these features. Eventually, the AI on your own machine will become strong enough to perform tasks like analyzing your email inbox and giving you pointers about the people you will be talking to in your upcoming calendar, like the last time you talked to them and what you talked about.\nTransparent OLED TVs from Samsung and LG\nOLED TVs took a new step forward at CES 2024 with transparency. Both Samsung and LG showed off their own versions of the clear TVs.\nSamsung showed its micro-LED display technology which has both brighter and clearer images along with better transparency. This means you can see through the TV to view objects on the other side, such as a window in a skyscraper apartment. You could use it to see through a window-like TV at a private suite in a sports stadium and see both the TV and the action on the field.\nThe LG Signature OLED T is expected to go on sale this year. It is a 77-inch 4K OLED TV with a retractable screen. It\u2019s designed for great ambience, allowing your TV to fade into the background or display an image like a digital fish tank.\nJust an inch thick, it uses wireless Zero Connect, which puts the cables and I/O in a separate box elsewhere. And it has a rolling contrast screen that can turn it into a TV.\nPricing isn\u2019t available yet. The clarity and quality of the TV looked amazing.\nCelestron Origin intelligent home observatory\nCelestron introduced\u00a0the Celstron Origin as a way for telescope fans to turn their home into an intelligent home observatory.\nThis product brings state-of-the-art RASA optics to both novice and seasoned astronomers, enabling effortless exploration of the universe from the comfort of one\u2019s living room, backyard, or campsite. That could make Celestron competitive with Unistellar, which uses AI to filter out light noise in cities so you can look at other galaxies via a telescope in your backyard.\nCelestron said the Celestron Origin incorporates decades of its innovation and expertise, integrating the most sophisticated optical and astronomical technology available today.\nAt its core is a customized version of the Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA) f/2.2 optical system. This system, renowned for its extraordinary wide field of view and ultra-fast telescope technology, has been the preferred choice of professional researchers and government institutions worldwide.\nThe company said what sets Celestron Origin apart is its onboard camera sensor and AI-powered image processing capabilities, which bring celestial objects from deep space to users\u2019 smartphones, tablets, or smart TV/projectors in stunning color and detail within seconds.\nIn addition to its optical performance, Celestron Origin incorporates integrated software, a mobile app, and automated electronics that provide unprecedented convenience and ease-of-use, regardless of the user\u2019s skill level. Previously time-consuming tasks such as sky alignment, focusing, tracking, object identification, and location are now autonomously managed by Celestron Origin\u2019s all-in-one intelligent functionality.\nCelestron Origin offers users a complete star-concierge experience. Users can even schedule deep-space viewing while they sleep by preselecting multiple celestial objects, which are then autonomously captured and saved for later viewing or sharing with family, friends, and fellow astronomy enthusiasts.\nhe observatory\u2019s proprietary app, developed in collaboration with Simulation Curriculum, features a planetarium-style interface that provides educational audio presentations on the selected celestial objects. The app also allows for fully remote operation via smartphone or tablet, including the option to mirror the screen on a smart TV for indoor viewing comfort.\nThe Celestron Origin is the culmination of more than a decade of development, the company said.\nI would also give an honorable mention to Unistellar, which came out with its smaller Odyssey telescope at CES 2024. Its previous announcements spurred a competitive response from Celestron, a much bigger company. Unistellar\u00a0is also extending its pursuit of backyard astronomers with the launch of a new generation of its AI telescopes dubbed the Odyssey Smart Telescope.\nThe promise is to bring the cosmos closer than ever before through a transformative stargazing experience for both seasoned astronomers and enthusiastic novices on a cosmic journey from the comfort of their homes, even amidst urban landscapes, the company said.\nWithings BeamO health multiscope\nDigital health company\u00a0Withings\u00a0announced its\u00a0BeamO\u00a0\u201cmultiscope,\u201d a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe Beamo fuses the capabilities of thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. In other words, the multiscope can do more than a fitness watch and leapfrog other single-purpose devices.\nThe aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors in remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nTypically, temperature is the only health scan performed regularly at home, Withings said. BeamO is positioned to become the new thermometer of the future in every home and observe heart and lung health at the same time, the company hopes.\nWe don\u2019t have our Star Trek Tricorder yet, but we\u2019re getting there. Last year, Withings made headlines at CES 2023 with its\u00a0urinalysis tool\u00a0based on toilet readings.\nThis advanced \u201cmultiscope\u201d will place the ability to measure core health vitals taken during physician visits into the palm of the hand and will become available in the United States following FDA clearance, Withings said.\nFor the first time, BeamO will combine ECG, oximeter, stethoscope, and thermometer sensors to turn the humble thermometer into a powerful tool for regular monitoring of heart and lung health. Portable and smaller than a smartphone, it is designed to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and to substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.\nBeamO is packed with sensors that beam light waves to interpret blood flow patterns and temperature, as well as acoustic information. It performs multiple functions in one handheld device.\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes along its sides allow BeamO to perform blood oxygenation (SpO2) and heart rate readings simultaneously while also conducting a medical-grade 1-lead ECG. A simple light grip of BeamO initiates measurements that can be viewed by users in real-time on its animated colored LED display.\nBeamO conducts accurate and stable core body temperature readings with a noninvasive scan of the temporal artery. An advancement on the Withings Thermo sensor technology, the second-generation hotspot sensor is a mono-element thermophile that narrows the focal area of the infrared beam for contactless measurements. This increases the sensitivity of the scan, making it more robust to changes in distance from the skin or movement.\nA cutting-edge digital stethoscope, BeamO captures chest or back acoustic sound waves through a Piezoelectric disc. With intuitive tutorials, users achieve precise heart and lung measurements. Equipped with a USB-C to jack adapter, results can be heard through headphones and seamlessly transferred, stored, and shared in the app. During telehealth sessions, audio streaming enables physicians to guide device placement and focus on specific areas of interest.\nBeamO will retail at $250 in June 2024, following FDA clearance of its ECG capability. It\u2019s a high price for a glorified thermometero. But Withings notes BeamO will conduct a 4-in-1 health checkup of body temperature, heart, and lung health in under a minute.\nL\u2019Oreal AirLight Pro hair dryer\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Groupe\u00a0unveiled AirLight Pro, a sustainable hair dryer that can adjust to the type of hair it\u2019s drying.\nThe product is backed by 150 patents \u2014 not bad for a non-tech company that is 115 years old. But that\u2019s the nature of technology\u2019s broad reach these days, where non-tech companies are leading with technology products and the tech itself fades into the woodwork.\nAirLight Pro, developed in collaboration with Zuvi, a hardware startup founded by experts in drone engineering and science, boasts a blend of infrared-light technology and high-speed wind to revolutionize hair drying. The tool promises visually smoother and more hydrated hair while consuming up to 31% less energy across various hair types.\nThe brainchild of a partnership between L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s haircare expertise and Zuvi\u2019s technological prowess, AirLight Pro incorporates Zuvi\u2019s patented LightCare technology, utilizing infrared light and high-speed wind to efficiently dry hair while preserving internal moisture. AirLight Pro will be available in 2024 and will cost under $400.\nUnlike conventional heating hair dryers with only heating coils, AirLight Pro is equipped with a special 17-blade, high-speed motor and patented infrared technology powered by tungsten\u2013halogen bulbs designed for fast hair drying without excessive heat. By efficiently drying water on the hair surface, hair isleft with internal moisture in the strand resulting in smooth, shiny hair.\nAirLight Pro not only promises up to 33% more hydrated and 59% smoother hair but also features faster drying times and an enhanced user experience. It was built by a team of more than 100 engineers.\nThe Sphere\nIt\u2019s not on sale unless you\u2019ve got more than $1 billion. But The Sphere is an amazing technological achievement that was on display all the time during CES 2024.\nI was able to see Postcard from Earth in a group suite with Ansys. Sure, it wasn\u2019t U2. But the 2023 film about life on Earth and our climate risks was amazing. It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, and it was designed and shot for the 16K resolution video screen of The Sphere.\nIt\u2019s a 4D film with 270 degrees of viewing experience. It includes haptic seats that rumble with a stampede, scents and wind that blows at you as if it were coming from the screen. The Sphere\u2019s wind effects units can technically achieve blasts of up to 140 mph.\u00a0Spatial audio comes from 168,000 speakers.\nThe Sphere has 1.2 million LED lights on the exterior that you can see from miles away, and it\u2019s the largest such building in the world. The venue seats 17,385 people. We\u2019ll see if The Sphere keeps generating attendees. The advertising on the exterior alone is probably generating a ton of revenue.\nInside, the 160,000 square feet screen is the largest screen in the world. The giant LED screen wraps over and behind the audience, delivering a totally immersive visual environment.\u00a0While the film isn\u2019t that interactive, I imagine there will be more of that in the future. For now, it\u2019s a place where you can see back and relax and be mesmerized.\nPivotal\u2019s Helix light eVTOL aircraft\nKristina Menton, COO of Pivotal, showed off the Helix, a light electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that has been in the making for 12 years.\nWhen I saw a video of her flying the aircraft, I asked Menton if she was crazy. She said she was a trained pilot with a lot of hours in the aircraft, which is the first Pivotal aircraft that will be made at scale.\nWeighing in at just 348 pounds empty, the Helix is classified as an ultralight aircraft. It doesn\u2019t require a pilot\u2019s license to be flown, but it is prohibited in urban areas and can only be flown in rural areas. It costs $190,000 and up.\nIt runs on electric power, and it has a 20-minute or 20-mile range, with 20% reserved for safety purposes. It has digital instruments and simple controls. While Helix does not require a pilot\u2019s license for ownership, it does require a lot of training.\nIt can take off vertically and land the same way, but it flies like a plane with its fixed rotors, tandem wings and tilt aircraft. It\u2019s a single-seat aircraft with no passengers allowed, per requirements of Part 103 Ultralight regulations in the U.S. It has amphibious capability restricted to emergency landings. It\u2019s only 13 feet and 7 inches long, 5 feet and 3 inches high, and 13 feet and 5 inches long.\nThe wingspan is 33.13 feet. It can bear a load of up to 220 pounds and someone no taller than 6 feet 5 inches. It can fly at 55 knots, or 63 miles per hour. The aircraft is made from carbon fiber. It has a triple redundant flight control system, eight rotors with six required for flight and landing, and split elevons that tolerate servo failure.\nClicks case brings back the physical keyboard to smartphones\nClicks Technology\u00a0is bringing back the days of physical keyboards for iPhones. The company showed off its Clicks keyboard/case that will make you nostalgic for the good old Blackberry.\nThis accessory is a case and keyboard built in one, working with either the Lightning or USB-C connector (which is used on the newer iPhones like the iPhone 15). The company showed it at the\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0show and folks were lined up to check it out at the party where I saw it.\nIt\u2019s based on the belief that a tactile keyboard gives content creators and users a better experience reminiscent of older devices like the BlackBerry, known for its physical QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard has a soft touch and the case has a solid grip. You can turn on a backlight with a button push.\nWith a full set of real buttons, Clicks offers iPhone users an alternative to the virtual keyboard, liberating valuable screen space and empowering users to multitask more efficiently. Scheduled for availability starting February 1, the Clicks keyboard is available for pre-order at a pricey $139.\nIt comes from Michael Fisher, cofounder of Clicks Technology. Fisher is a YouTube tech reviewer known as MrMobile with 1.2 million subscribers, and Kevin Michaluk (known as CrackBerry Kevin), alongside a team of experts with mobile experience from companies like Apple, BlackBerry, and Google.\nThe Clicks creator keyboard enhances the iPhone experience with screen real estate. By removing the keyboard from the display, Clicks maximizes the screen, doubling the available space for content immersion.\nIt offers a more natural typing experience for people on the move. Clicks facilitates mobile creation tasks like writing notes, editing documents, or prompt action on ideas. And it introduces iOS keyboard shortcuts to iPhone users for improved navigation and task handling.\nUtilizing the Lightning or USB-C connection means that Clicks requires no separate battery or Bluetooth connection.\nThe Clicks Founders Edition, available in BumbleBee and London Sky colors, offers exclusive benefits including VIP support and early access to future releases.\nMuscle Suit Every gives you an exoskeleton\u2019s strength\nThe Muscle Suit Every from Japan\u2019s Innophys makes everything feel lighter. The exoskeleton is pretty low tech, but it lightens the load on your back, and it assists you with basic everyday motions like picking things up.\nThe suit weighs 8.3 pounds. The exoskeleton assists your movements with up to 25.5 kgf of auxiliary force. The Innophys rep told me that\u2019s like lifting 25 pounds and feeling like you\u2019re lifting five pounds. I tried it out and they helped me put it on in seconds. When I bent down, I could feel the suit deliver force to my hamstrings, making it easy to come back up. I saw a woman pick up a big man with the suit.\nThe artificial muscle uses air pressure. You pump it up when you want more strength. It adjusts to the movement of every person wearing it. It needs no electricity, as the manual pump comes with it.\nThe Muscle Suit uses a McKibben-type artificial muscle as its driving force. The rubber tube is encased in a mesh made from polyester monofilament and both ends are secured with metal in this simple configuration.\nThe Muscle Suit is made up of a back frame and thigh frame, and a rotation axis that connects the two. The upper end of the artificial muscle is affixed to the upper portion of the back frame, and the connected wire is affixed to the rotation axis at the lower end. With the compression of the artificial muscle, the wire is pulled and the back frame rotates around the rotation axis. As the thigh frame, which is affixed to the rotation axis, rotates in the opposite direction, the upper body is held upright using the thighs as the fulcrum.\nDoublepoint lets you control things via finger gestures\nFinland\u2019s Doublepoint Technologies launched a gesture-tech app on Google Play that shows off its gesture-touch technology for Android wearables such as watches.\nYou can do things like pinch at a virtual object with your fingers and the Android watch will detect your wrist movements and convey to the smartphone or computer that you\u2019re pinching your fingers. The company said it can very accurately detect such \u201cmicrogestures\u201d and do so much more cheaply than cameras, which are used in devices such as virtual reality headsets.\nThe app introduces the brand-new gesture-touch technology, coupled with instant Bluetooth connectivity to a myriad of devices, marking a leap in human-computer interaction, the company said.\nThe Finnish startup has released a version of its gesture detection algorithm, now compatible with WearOS smartwatches, aiming to elevate user experiences beyond traditional touch interfaces. You control things via a Bluetooth connection to the watch.\nRazer\u2019s Project Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept dubbed Project Esther. The company embedded the force-feedback tech in gaming chair cushion.\nI tried it out by playing a mech combat game where I had to shoot four different kinds of weapons at a bunch of enemies attacking my base. It was a frenzied scene where I could feel the haptics of explosions in my seat. But the rumble also came in through the game controller I was holding as well as the headphones that I was wearing. You could ratchet up or down the experiences. One of the coolest experiences was hearing and feeling the THX sound logo.\nProject Esther isn\u2019t available just yet. But it\u2019s pretty interesting how haptics is moving in new directions. Now all they need is a fan to blow wind and rain at you.\nStern Pinball\u2019s Jaws\nStern Pinball\u00a0said its latest line of pinball games inspired by one of cinema\u2019s most gripping motion picture thrillers \u2013 Jaws, from Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment.\nPlayers can now immerse themselves in the iconic trilogy with cool pinball technology and mechanical features that bring the film\u2019s best moments to life. The Jaws pinball games come in pro, premium, and limited edition (LE) models, providing enthusiasts with various options to dive into the game\u2019s narrative.\nThe Jaws-themed pinball games transport players to the picturesque yet perilous setting of Amity Island, off the coast of Long Island, New York. As the beloved fishing community gears up for Fourth of July celebrations, danger lurks beneath the surface as shark attacks threaten the island\u2019s peace.\nMirroring the film\u2019s intense storyline, players step into the shoes of Quint, the grizzled fisherman, tasked with combating the ominous ocean creatures. The gameplay features aiming pinballs at a motorized shark fin target, accompanied by animated lighting effects, while navigating through the Orca Boat upper playfield.\nI played two rounds and did pretty good. But it was hard getting time at the machines with so many people gathered around it.\nVarjo X4 headset can transport you to other places\nVarjo released its \u201cgaze-directed\u201d XR-4 Series mixed reality headset today for $3,990, or half the price of its previous enterprise VR headsets.\nVarjo\u2018s goal is to deliver mixed reality experiences that are indistinguishable from natural sight. The Helsinki, Finland-based company has made multiple generations of high-end VR and AR \u2014 mixed reality \u2014 headsets since 2016. I finally got a good look at it in a suite where I could see the fidelity of its 4K per eye displays.\nI put the headset on and it felt lighter, given the engineering to balance the headset on your head. I was transported to a scene in an artist\u2019s room. And it was pretty amazing how real it looked. It was a static scene in three dimensions, but everywhere I looked it felt like I was in another place that was real. I could also see someone else\u2019s outline if they came to close to me in the room. Things blurred when I moved.\nIt has added gaze-directed, high-resolution autofocus cameras in mixed reality with the XR-4 Series, which comes in either a Focal Edition or a Secure Edition.\nThrough the fusion of its highest-resolution displays, foveated capture stream, advanced LiDAR depth sensing and camera sensors, all of which mimic the function of the human eye, the Varjo XR-4 series offers virtual and mixed reality experiences that go beyond consumer-grade headsets by far, the company said.\nVarjo said rival headsets cater to 2D productivity use cases. But Varjo\u2019s 4th generation headsets are designed to deliver deeply immersive VR/XR experiences for industrial customers who require top visual fidelity and performance. The previous headsets came out in 2020.\nToday, over 25% of Fortune 100 companies are using Varjo\u2019s technology to train astronauts and pilots, radically shorten automotive production timelines, power medical breakthroughs, and render stunning 3D visualizations for architects and designers.\nPowered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and integrated into the Nvidia Omniverse, the XR-4 series allows developers and industrial users to render photorealistic scenes and unlock ray tracing in mixed reality.\nThe combined technologies dwarf the computational power that can be achieved with a mobile chip and are a game-changer for developers, Varjo said.\nThis headset has a 50% larger field of view than the previous headset, with a 120-degree viewing angle. It can produce 28 million pixels across both eyes.\nThe headset has dual 4K x 4K displays with a resolution of 51 pixels per degree (ppd) and over 50% wider field of view (120\u00b0 x 105\u00b0) compared to previous-generation devices, with double the display brightness (200 nits) and wider color gamut with 96% DCI-P3.\nIt also has dual 20 Mpx cameras for powering the industry\u2019s highest-fidelity, real-time photorealistic video pass-through mixed reality. And it has new ambient light sensors and 8 x improved LiDAR resolution compared to Varjo XR-3 that seamlessly blends real and virtual elements.\nGoodyear\u2019s demo of tire intelligence\nGoodyear announced that it has built tire intelligence into its tires with the help of tech-focused partners.\nI spoke about these developments with Chris Helsel, senior vice president of global operations and CTO at Goodyear, in an interview. Tire intelligence means getting data on the actual state of wear of a tire and making predictions about how long that tire will last or how it will perform in emergency conditions.\nThis is about getting real world information about the state of your tires and using that information for everything from scheduling replacement, getting maintenance or avoiding crashes. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is talking about this at its first booth appearance at\u00a0CES 2024 for the first time in its 126-year history. And it\u2019s why Goodyear brought its world-famous Goodyear Blimp to the show. I was lucky enough to get a ride in it.\nBut the coolest tech was down on the show floor, where I was able to get in a simulator. It showed me the stopping distance that I would have if the car used knowledge of the state of the tires along with other information coming from the car\u2019s sensors. The first time I went driving in the rain, I found I couldn\u2019t stop fast enough at a stop sign and I ran right into a deer. Fortunately, that part wasn\u2019t animated.\nThe second and third times, I was able to stop well ahead of the stop sign with the added capability turned on. I was also able to do demos that showed the tire handling in driving between cones, when I had different tires on the car at different times. And I was able to experience what hydroplaning was like \u2014 spinning out on a wet onramp \u2014 without fearing for my life.\nTranslation apps\nMymanu came back with live voice translation earbuds which can translate spoken words into your ears via earbuds or to a handheld device via text.\nThe day when you can\u2019t get by without a translator may be gone soon.\nThere were a lot of translators at CES. Another was the Vasco Translator E1, which goes on sale in June for $390. It can translate 50 languages in real time while connected to an app on your smartphone.\nVasco added translations from linguists who can address idioms when a literal translation will be wrong.\nThe translated text is visible in the app and spoken to your through your earphone. I haven\u2019t tried all of these out, but they all seem pretty space age to me.\nHonorable mentions\nHonorable mentions include the GE Smart Indoor Smoker, which lets you smoke meats and more inside your home; the $700 Xreal Air 2 Ultra augmented reality glasses that will give the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro a run for its money; the Samsung Ballie, which is a bowling ball robot that rolls around your home and answers questions for you and projects images on a wall; and the Rabbit R1 which is a $200 AI gadget that serves as an assistant for you.\nExcellent things that were back for another year\nSkyted\u2019s silent mask\nSkyted showed off a silent privacy mask that makes you look like Bane. It\u2019s the kind of mask that fighter pilots wear to keep all the noise of the jet engine away from their microphone as they speak into the jet\u2019s radio.\nThe mask is pretty tight, but it is not rated for HEPA or keeping out unhealthy germs. Rather, it\u2019s a privacy filter that is soundproof. When you speak into it, no one else can hear you. So you can take a private business call in a busy area, and you don\u2019t have to worry about being overheard.\nYou could talk in a library or even on a crowded airplane.\nThe Pimax Crystal\nI stopped by Pimax\u2018s booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center and saw some pretty good demos of games running on simulation rigs.\nThe people using the rigs wore Pimax Crystal headsets, which deliver an ultra-realistic virtual reality experience. At the show, Pimax was showing off the 60G AirLink, utilizing cutting-edge 60G millimeter wave(mmWave) technology.\nIt enables high-speed wireless data transmission and low latency, pivotal for video streaming and immersive VR experiences. It has good bandwidth and anti-interference features. Pimax showed off its 12K-EVT\u03b8 prototype with a wide field of view. Pimax also showed off a flight simulator and a racing simulator with players wearing the VR headset.\nMilo Action Communicator\nLoose Cannon Systems\u00a0was back with its\u00a0Milo\u00a0wearable action communicators as reimagined walkie-talkies for outdoor adventurers.\nYou can use them to speak with groups of friends and family while you ride, surf, ski and more. The Milo communicator is hands-free, phone-free, and requires no Wi-Fi or cell signal. It also has some cool AI technology built into it. Now it can verify who is in your group and easily add or delete people.\nThe latest model has more functions for folks who need to keep track of each other for social and safety reasons while out in the wild.\nHyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe\u00a0Hyundai Mobis Mobion enables cars to move diagonally, sideways, or even spin around in circles. It uses a new steering technology with advanced robotics that allow the vehicle to maneuver into different positions that you can run into when trying to get through crowds or parking a vehicle in a tight spot.\nHyundai hopes to be taking the tech to market in 2025. The wheels can move independently and more as you can see in the demo.\nHover Air X1 self-flying selfie drone\nThe HoverAir X1 is an easy-to-use self-flying selfie drone that sells for $350. It only weighs 4.4 ounces, and it sports a 2.7K selfie camera mounted in a drone with high-speed fans.\nI\u2019ve tested one of these and it is easy to use. You simply sync it to the app on the smartphone via Bluetooth. Then you turn it on, hold it flat in your hand, and then launch it via the app. It takes off and runs a pattern, like hovering by you, and it snaps a picture. It can also go high in the air, orbit around you, or follow you and take pictures.\nIt tracks you and captures you in cinematic moments from angles where you can\u2019t easily do it yourself.\nWacky AI item\nAI was all over the show, of course. But the winner of my wacky AI award goes to the AI Backpack from Happysites. The Happysites LED backpacks let you create your own light shows on the back of your backpack. But if you aren\u2019t feeling too creative, the company will let you use generative AI to help you make your own image or clip.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

It can set the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year and shine a spotlight on how companies intend to be part of those conversations.\n\u201cPerhaps the question to ask is what AI will not touch this year,\u201d said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at Forrester. \u201cChatGPT has fueled such a frenzy over the last year that companies feel the AI train is one they must scramble onto, even if they have no idea where it\u2019s going.\u201d\nChatterjee said to expect AI in everything such as chips and cards from companies including Intel and Nvidia, and consumer devices like refrigerators from Samsung with the \u201cAI Family Hub.\u201d Varying panel discussions will hit on AI\u2019s possible impact on jobs and ethical considerations.\nThe Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES each year, said it is expecting about 130,000 in-person attendees this year, up from about 115,000 last year and 45,000 in 2022 amid concerns of the Covid-19 Omicron variant. CTA is once again offering a livestream for some events this year.\nThe show will feature more than 4,000 exhibitors and 1,200 startups from all over the world. Featured speakers will include executives from companies such as Samsung, LG and Microsoft, as well as discussions with Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Apple, which is typically absent from CES, is once again not expected to participate.\nAbout 60% of the Fortune 500 companies will be in attendance, according to the CTA, enabling diverse product launches and discussions around all areas of tech and beyond. Beauty is now an official product category at CES, with L\u2019Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus delivering the company\u2019s first CES keynote.\nThe show also remains one of the fastest growing auto exhibitions in the world. Various forms of transportation, from floating and rolling to flying, will be featured this year.\nFor example, boating company Brunswick will show off electric boats and motors as well as self-piloting\u00a0recreational boats. VinFast, the Vietnamese electric vehicle company that only recently entered the US market, will unveil new models including a small SUV. And Hyundai will be there with an electric aircraft from its air taxi subsidiary Supernal.\nAs always, various automakers will also have exhibits showing off the latest in what people will be able to see and do inside their cars.\nBeyond AI\nFoldable displays, next-generation wearables and mixed reality-related accessories are also expected to get ample attention this year.\n\u201cExpect use cases [for AR and VR] beyond gaming like multimedia consumption and enterprise usage such as training, onboarding and collaboration,\u201d said Ramon Llamas, a director at market research firm IDC. \u201cIt\u2019s important for companies to stake their ground before Apple releases the Vision Pro later this year.\u201d\nNew wearable form factors will be on display, too. One gadget \u2014 called Dusk Rx, which is up for a 2024 CES Innovation Award \u2014 promises to be the world\u2019s first prescription-ready glasses that gives users control over the tint of their lenses via the frame or within an app. Meanwhile, a pair of high-tech leggings \u2014 also up for an Innovation Award \u2014 touts a high-tech microcurrent intended to boost athletic performance.\nSome companies could show off upgraded versions of previous innovations. Over the past few years, for example, voice-activated devices and smart speakers dominated CES as companies raced to add their voice assistants into everything from microwaves to toilets.\nWhile it was largely overestimated how consumers would use the technology, those same businesses could bring voice to the next level with generative AI, the technology that fuels products like ChatGPT.\n\u201cIt will be interesting to track whether a gen AI-powered capability can make the process of voice interaction far more intuitive and useful than before, resetting the clock on voice applications,\u201d Chatterjee said.\nAlthough CES overall is still a useful barometer to gauge market trends, the amount and diversity of the tech products on display makes it hard for anything to truly break through, noted Stuart Carlaw, a chief research officer at ABI Research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s akin to a group of blindfolded explorers trying to understand the full extent of the elephant they are interacting with,\u201d Carlaw said.\n\u201cThe one exception is AI,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an AI story, are you even a tech company?\u201d\nCES runs through Friday, January 12.\nCNN\u2019s Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

Health-tech for women rules the world\nThe intersection of health and tech is a key space for CES, which explains the explosion in panels, keynotes, and conversations at the show on the topic.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n6 trends to watch for at CES 2024: AI everywhere, Meteor Lake laptops, smart appliances, metaverse, and more\nA really big show\nThe future is just around the corner -- and you'll be able to catch a peek of it in early January. Every year, the technology industry gathers in Las Vegas for CES, an annual tech industry expo where the year ahead in products is previewed, tested, and talked about. It\u2019s like catnip for the technology world.\nTraditionally, CES highlights include flat-screen TVs, soundbars, and other consumer electronics, and for the curious, TechRadar has a great round-up of what to expect from CES 2024. I don\u2019t foresee much revolution in those traditional spaces landing at this year\u2019s show. But that doesn\u2019t mean innovation has slowed; here\u2019s my take on the biggest trends that will shape the show, and the products and innovations I\u2019m expecting to see \u2013 as well as those I\u2019d like to see more of.\nAnd since CES is also the launchpad for more hype than a rap record, I\u2019ve highlighted a few areas where the hot air will be hottest.\n1. AI everywhere \u2013 especially on your laptop\nArtificial Intelligence has been driving consumer electronics for ages now. Half a decade ago, I spoke with LG Electronics President and CTO I.P. Park, who told me AI could simplify complicated systems and help people get more out of their gear. \u201cWhen you\u2019re driving a modern luxury car most people are probably using only five percent of the entire feature set of the car,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s too complex \u2026 what AI will hopefully do is solve the problem of using complex systems so that the devices become smart. And smart devices will know exactly what you want,\u201d Park added. Everything LG makes would include it, he said.\nSo how much progress has been made in the last five years? Not all that much, I\u2019d argue. Until last year, that is, a watershed period that debuted generative AI (for better or worse), chatbots, and Microsoft\u2019s announcement that it would bake AI into a revolutionary new version of Windows expected for sometime next summer. They\u2019ll probably call it something horrible like Windows 1124H2, but think about it as Windows 12. And at CES 2024, AI PCs built for it will be all over the place.\nOn Dec. 14, Intel unveiled Meteor Lake, its newest chipset, which includes for the first time a dedicated AI processor component, called an NPU or Neural Processing Unit. AMD beat them to the punch, announcing at last year\u2019s CES the Ryzen 7040 notebook processors, which incorporate \u201cAMD XDNA AI\u201d \u2013 again, dedicated AI support. And at CES this year, we expect most major laptop manufacturers will unveil their AI PC lineups. Watch for huge, splashy reveals from Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer, Asus, MSI and more.\n2. Appliances get Serious AI\nBut what about Park\u2019s comments? Is your vacuum today AI-powered? Does your iron know just how much steam is too much? If AI is in all things, surrounding us like the Midi-chlorians that let Luke use The Force, why aren\u2019t our appliances better? Yes, today's washers and dryers use AI to sense humidity levels and adjust accordingly. But is this AI? Does this require intelligence or merely better sensors? And no standard-size oven can, for example, detect whether your Thanksgiving turkey is perfectly moist.\nWill CES 2024 change that? Doubtful, at least for traditional, full-size devices. Although fascinating advances continue: I\u2019m particularly impressed by Whirlpool, which will be showcasing a range of new appliances with SlimTech insulation, a proprietary material that can replace the bulky polyurethane foam in the walls of your current fridge. SlimTech can reduce the wall thickness by up to 66 percent -- allowing for up to 25 percent more capacity. Amazing! In 2023 LG showed off MoodUp, a color-changing fridge meant to one-up Samsung\u2019s beautiful Bespoke French door refrigerators. What will this year bring?\nApparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone.\nTo see the biggest changes, narrow your gaze: Look to the smaller, smarter countertop devices that have proliferated in recent years from June, Brava, and Anova. Those devices have limited AI built-in, nothing to rival the advances seen over the last year, but a ton more than traditional kitchen gear. And then there\u2019s Seer Grills, which recently launched Perfecta, billed as \u201cThe World\u2019s First AI-Powered Grill.\u201d Apparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone. And we\u2019ve seen remarkable new devices from GE\u2019s Profile division, which recently unveiled a countertop nugget ice maker. Will the new year bring anything new? We\u2019re looking at you, GE\u2026\nAnd one space in particular is thriving: robot vacuum cleaners. With household names like Eureka and Roomba competing against lesser-known names like Narwal and Ecovacs, it\u2019s going to be a messy fight. (See what I did there?) And there\u2019s plenty of innovation: At IFA 2023 in Berlin, Switchbot launched a vacuum that connects directly to your water pipes, letting it wash itself clean before going back to work for you. And since Matter unveiled support for robovacs in 1.2 of its sorta useful spec, they should hopefully work more seamlessly with all of your other digital gear. Maybe Matter will matter?\n3. Smarthome: Here comes the smart grid\nSpeaking of the smarthome, the industry is evolving.\nWhole-home chargers and solar power cells have become an enormous focus for the consumer electronics industry, as the power industry \u2013 at last \u2013 gets smarter. It\u2019s a logical advancement from companies that make batteries and chargers, starting with powerhouse names like Anker, which unveiled the Solix brand in June and will likely reveal more in the lineup at CES. Think of Solix and its ilk as giant battery packs for your house. Its largest capacity 180kWh array can apparently keep the lights on in a typical house for a whole week, which could come in handy if your local grid is impacted by extreme weather.\nLook for news from Jackery as well, which was named to TIME\u2019s Best Inventions of 2023 for its Solar Mars Bot \u2013 how cool is that? And there are dozens of companies looking at the home battery space, from big names like Schneider Electric and Bluetti to newcomers like Exeger and Ugreen and Goal Zero (and its $4,000 YetiPRO portable power station) and more.\nIt\u2019s also a place for new brand names to flourish like flowers under a solar-powered grow lamp (which you can also find at CES). And innovation in general: Samsung recently added the first ever EV charger to its SmartThings platform, letting users better manage and monitor the charge in their electric vehicle, as well as a partnership with Eve Energy to let you keep tabs on how much juice everything in your home is sipping.\nOne interesting twist on the standard battery comes from Palo Alto, California, start-up Coplanar, which sells portable hydrogen power generators and whole-home energy products. It\u2019s a renewable clean energy source using a chemical reaction rather than combustion, producing only water and heat as byproducts. Hydrogen power\u2026what could go wrong?\n4. Cars go electric, not autonomous\nWhile the worlds of tech and automotive seem to be racing at each other faster than Vin Diesel and his pals, the market for self-driving cars has already burst like a punctured tire. GM\u2019s Cruise self-driving car company lost $1.4 billion in 2022 alone, and Ford took a drubbing, writing off $2.7B in 2022 and noting in its earnings report that it would shift focus from the Level 4 autonomous systems being developed by Argo AI to driver-assistance tech such as adaptive cruise control and lane-switching assistance.\nThe market for self-driving cars has burst like a punctured tire.\nThis means there will be tons of real-world tech on display at CES 2024, actual stuff you can actually buy today for your next actual car. Will Chrysler and Tesla continue to lead the driver-assist world? Only time will tell.\nOf course, EVs will be all over the show, and rightly so. 2020 saw around 3 million in global EV sales; by 2023, that had rocketed to 10.25 million, and the number is predicted to hit the 17 million mark in five years. Electric vehicles are moving towards the software-defined vehicle (SDV) category, which means much of the vehicle's functionality (and even its powertrain) can be tweaked and updated via over-the-air updates (OTA). Ford recently discussed its plans for SDV features. Look for other makers to detail similar plans at CES.\nMeanwhile, tech companies continue chomping at the bit to get into cars. Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Huawei are jumping headfirst into this space, and we expect to hear from numerous other electric car startups, including Lucid, Polestar, Fisker, and Faraday Future. Okay, maybe NOT Faraday Future.\n5. Health-tech for women rules the world\nThe intersection of health and tech is a key space for CES, which explains the explosion in panels, keynotes, and conversations at the show on the topic. Among those speaking at CES are Linda Anegawa, Noom\u2019s Chief of Medicine; Jesse Ehrenfeld, President of the American Medical Association; Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna; and Gail K. Boudreaux, president and CEO of Elevance Health.\nThey reflect all aspects of the wide world of health, from award-winning pacemaker innovations from healthcare giant Abbott to smart beds, health monitors, fitness gadgets, digital doctors, and more. But one space stands head and shoulders above the rest: women's health.\nSometimes called femtech, innovations to help monitor, maintain, and improve women's health have been the source of many fascinating innovations lately. For just one example, consider the Evie smart ring from Movano Health, which debuted at CES 2023 and uses AI to connect the dots between menstrual cycles and sleep habits, among other things. In August the company filed for FDA clearance as a medical device; it finally ships in January, the company says.\nAnd expect day-to-day innovations in beauty tech, where smart mirrors and makeup aides are robotic wonders. L\u2019Oreal has an enormous history of innovation here: Last year it unveiled a computerized makeup applicator and the first at-home electronic eyebrow applicator. In 2017 it was a smart hair brush that we called \u201cthe combing coach you never knew you wanted.\u201d What will 2024 bring?\nThere's tech for all genders, of course. Withings has made a name for itself in the smart health space: The company invented the connected blood pressure monitor in 2011. And it continues to innovate on health gadgets: We have it on good authority that the company plans a multipurpose handheld device that looks intriguing for 2024. And we were impressed by NuraLogix at CES last year, which fairly accurately measures your blood pressure simply by taking a 30-second video. We\u2019re hoping this tech becomes a functional product in 2024.\nIf you\u2019re walking the show floor, look for an array of smart beds and massage chairs that always manage to give me a jolt of fresh energy. (Why don\u2019t I have one of these at home yet?)\n6. Hypewatch: VR/AR/MR, 6G and more\nIs it silly? Maybe! Is it over-hyped? Absolutely! Dare we call it just plain vanilla preposterous? You bet we do! But there are nonetheless advancements and work being done in augmented reality that might lead to an augmented future \u2013 with or without Mark\u2019s Meta.\nSoundscape makes a musical metaverse based on Unreal Engine 5, supporting avatars for an interactive VR music festival, for example. The company recently announced partnerships with GRiZ, Slash, Evanescence, Goose, and more, and promises additional partnerships with prominent labels before and after the launch at CES 2024. Heck, I\u2019d like to see a virtual concert. And VR for healthcare is absolutely a positive use of this technology. From immersive virtual reality and augmented reality for PTSD treatments to haptic feedback that can help restore lost senses, there\u2019s some reality amid the muck.\nAR is also just fun, with VR for cars, AR for astronauts, and MR for everything in between. But will it touch your life any time soon? We really, really doubt it.\nMeanwhile, watch out for big companies to slip the term 6G into presentations and displays. We know what you\u2019re thinking \u2026 and we\u2019re right with you.\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nAfter 25 years covering the technology industry, Jeremy Kaplan is a familiar face in the media world.

Every January, the industry's big shindig descends on this city in the Nevada desert, drawing tech manufacturers, retailers, distributors, members of the press, gadget fans, and regular old lookie-loos into the fray. The Las Vegas Convention Center, hotel expo halls, nightclubs, restaurants, and event centers are stuffed with talking screens, self-driving cars, flying cars, self-adjusting audio speakers, and ChatGPT-enabled appliances for the smart home. Indeed, this is the year that AI ate everything in sight; old products were freshened up by an injection of machine intelligence, and new products were launched to help people interface with these new generative tools.

These have been used to power chatbots, image generators and even office products but at CES AI will enter the real world.\nIntel has already announced its AI-heavy Meteor Lake chips, Samsung is adding AI to the Galaxy S24 series and companies like Snap, Walmart and Qualcomm are expected to make bigger moves in the AI space with keynotes at the event.\nOne of the big product areas for AI will be in accessibility, including smart glasses for the visually impaired using AI Vision models like GPT-4V or Gemini Ultra. We will also see robots capable of making decisions independently and chatbots in cars.\nWhat to expect from AI at CES 2024\nI\u2019ve already been sent details of robots that can handle food, grills with AI that can monitor cooking time and another AI tool that can learn your signature. Here are some of what I\u2019m either predicting or have already been told about for CES 2024.\nSmart home AI at CES 2024\nAlmost every smart home company will have some degree of AI in their products over the coming year. At CES we will see everything from simple tools to monitor cooking times through to home agents capable of connecting devices.\nAhead of the event, LG has already unveiled its cute two-legged AI robot that can walk around the home and act as an all-around independent household manager.\nA mini butler for the 21st century that controls appliances, connects devices and lends a hand in supporting smart tech. The agent also has sensors and cameras that it can use to take care of pets, detect unusual activities and send alerts to owners when they're not home.\nOther AI smart home announcements\nLG has also revealed an AI powered washer-dryer combo that can wash and dry clothes in under two hours using 60 percent less energy that others. It uses AI to detect fabric texture, soil level and load size and selects the optimal motions.\nSamsung is also adding AI to everything from refrigerators to cooktops. This includes a AI family hub refrigerator that uses AI vision to monitor how much you have of any item and whether you need to go grocery shopping.\nThere will also be smart televisions with built-in AI chatbots, mind-reading headsets and a smart lamp that uses AI to check for falls and monitor the health of residents.\nComputing with AI at CES 2024\nIntel and Qualcomm both have keynotes at CES where they\u2019ll expand on efforts to put AI into everything they make. There are also updates from AMD and others.\nAnnounced in December, Intel's Meteor Lake chips bring neural processing units to a new wave of Windows AI laptops. These allow for large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Microsoft Copilot to run on the device and not just in the cloud.\nAMD has dropped its \"Hawk Line\" of laptop CPUs that are also loaded with AI features. The features include software to boost AI performance by 1.6x when running Llama 2 or other vision models.\nOn top of a new lineup of AI-powered laptops and Qualcomm chips that can run large language models on a phone, Microsoft has also announced the first Windows keyboard update in 30 years \u2014 a Copilot key.\nAI Robots at CES 2024\nRobots are a big draw at any tech show, as they're a physical representation of artificial intelligence. This year we\u2019re starting to see robots with large language and vision AI models integrated into their systems for a deeper understanding of the world.\nWe\u2019ve already had details of the mini LG robot that keeps your house in order, watch your pets and even boost your mood, and a number of companies will be unveiling healthcare and assistive technology bots that have smiling faces to improve elderly care.\nOne of the robots on display will be a handwriting bot from a company called Handwrytten. It learns your signature and handwriting style through AI, then writes out greeting cards on your behalf to send to loved ones.\nAside from the next generation robots, there will also be new takes on the robot vacuum and mop. Among them is a Jet Bot Combo from Samsung that uses on-board AI to handle object avoidance and find stains.\nMore from Tom's Guide\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nRyan Morrison, a stalwart in the realm of tech journalism, possesses a sterling track record that spans over two decades, though he'd much rather let his insightful articles on artificial intelligence and technology speak for him than engage in this self-aggrandising exercise.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAfter a deluge of AI-powered products CES 2024 is making it tougher than ever to define what AI actually is\nAlgorithms, automation, and smart features\u2014what does it really mean to have a product powered by AI?\nThis week I've been at CES 2024: Stomping around Vegas for a week has left my feet sore, but it was worth it to get a first look at so many new products. This year, there were an overwhelming number of products brandishing AI abilities, and I'm left wondering what to make of it all.\nAnother CES, another buzzword. In previous years it's been blockchain, metaverse, and putting the word 'smart' in front of everything, but you don't win anything for guessing what it is for 2024. Artificial intelligence is the talk of the town and there was almost no escaping it during my travels of the Las Vegas tech show.\nIt's easy to understand why AI is taking the world by storm. The expeditious success of ChatGPT and image generation has the whole world watching. Now, most major tech firms are thinking about how they can integrate AI into their products, like Microsoft and Copilot for Windows or Intel with its latest Meteor Lake Core Ultra processors.\nThere's money to be made in AI. Nvidia is a trillion dollar company thanks to the propensity of its GPUs to supercharge AI. The creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has received billions in funding. These companies are bringing something genuinely new to the table, but not all AI features are so clearly brand new.\nSome of what I've seen advertised as AI over at CES 2024 looks like it could've been called a smart feature before the AI hype spiked, including sleep monitoring, automated timers, head tracking, and automatic mode switching.\nMany of these features existed before the AI boom. Is there something going on beneath the surface that makes any one of them more deserving of the AI tagline or is this tricksy marketing?\nWhat defines AI from other somewhat intelligent features is not altogether clear in many instances.\nFor some AI products, you'll find explicit references to training and learning, often with integration into a cloud-based system that takes on the brunt of the actual AI processing. Adobe, for example, offers AI algorithms that dabble in features its regular smart algorithms cannot, such as generative image creation. Admittedly, I still think the standard magic eraser tool is often more effective than its newer background removal, but I'm sure that'll change with time because the AI features can be improved with deployment of new models trained on new samples and feedback. It's this sort of training and feedback that begins to separate AI from traditional code made up of if statements and logic loops.\nThe MSI monitor pictured above also will come with an app capable of training the software to work with other games besides League of Legends.\nIn some other cases, I struggle to define what it is about 2024's AI products that supposedly differs from pre-existing smart features. The exact definition of artificial intelligence varies, especially in an age of AI and as new models and systems arrive. Though there are a few key terms to note.\nThe first is artificial general intelligence. This is defined as a system that is generally as smart, or smarter, than a human\u2014it can achieve similar results in a wide-range of tasks to a human, if not better. That differs from how a bot designed to play Go might surpass a human today in its ability, as the bot is highly specialised. Most consider a true AI to be in its ability to outthink a human in many ways, through self-learning and decision making.\nWe're nowhere close to general intelligence yet, though you'll hear companies like OpenAI talk about trying to reach it often. Once a system claims to be as intelligent as a human it's likely that this form of AI will become the only one worthy of the name.\nThat raises the interesting question of whether what we constitute as AI changes as AI gets smarter. I'd hold that's true to some extent. The various chatbots launched prior to ChatGPT already appear pretty formulaic compared to newer versions, and I doubt if/when we reach general intelligence for AI we'll still class today's ChatGPT bot as artificial intelligence. Yet today it's probably the best we've got, at least of the publicly available models.\nStanford University's institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence publishes a list of AI definitions [PDF warning] that includes one from emeritus professor John McCarthy in 1955. McCarthy defines AI as \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.\" By this definition it's possible to define all manner of technologies over the past few decades to the advancing of AI. That's true, as AI wouldn't be here without decades of computer science, yet Stanford also appends its own definition to help clear things up.\n\"Much research has humans program machines to behave in a clever way, like playing chess, but, today, we emphasize machines that can learn, at least somewhat like human beings do.\"\nWhat we're looking for is a machine that can match a human in some way and is able to learn.\nThe human bit of that definition is not all that applicable to the AI PCs and appliances over at CES 2024. These are working to a somewhat different definition. One that refers to learning and automation\u2014what many would describe as machine learning.\nMost definitions put machine learning as a subset of AI, and though related as they are, they're crucially different. Machine learning is about analysing data or images, recognising patterns, and using that to improve upon itself. The sort of thing you'll see applied with AI noise cancellation software.\nAs Microsoft outlines, machine learning and AI go together to make a genuinely useful machine. This machine learning lays the foundation of understanding for a device, and the AI harnesses that to make decisions. You can see this sort of symbiotic relationship in computer vision, where machine learning is used to teach a car about dangers on the road, but the job of hitting the brakes before crashing into a cow\u2014imitating a human reaction\u2014comes down to AI.\nThe difficulty is in how these definitions are then applied to products and how we apply them historically.\nTake the MSI Prestige 16 AI Evo, for example. This is a laptop fitted with MSI's \"AI Engine\", which \"detects user scenarios and automatically adjusts hardware settings to achieve the best performance.\" My question is how is this AI versus, say, Nvidia's GPU Boost algorithm? GPU boost uses various sensors on a graphics card to automatically boost performance where thermal and power constraints allow, but that feature has been around since 2012 and no one calls that AI, for good reason.\nThere's definitely some overlap between intelligent features that react to human input and those that are learning from it, and I'd be keen to know if MSI's profile switching feature actually learns from a user's actions to improve over time and that's what defines it as AI. That seems to be the best way I'm able to tell between artificially intelligent features from plain ol' smart ones.\nBest gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.\nBest gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.\nFurthermore, AI isn't altogether a local technology. For the most part, these AI features are made possible by massive data centres, and you could say the AI revolution is riding the wave of the cloud computing one. We are seeing more AI processing power located locally, as in on your own PC\u2014Nvidia GPUs come with heaps of AI processing cores and Intel's latest Core Ultra chips feature an AI-accelerating NPU\u2014but many of today's AI features require an internet connection. So, that sort of further muddies the water of what's actually an AI product and what's just tapping into an AI service elsewhere.\nDifficult to define by its very nature, the various subsects of AI make smelling out the true use cases of AI even more difficult. The only practical conclusion I can come to is that stamping the catch-all term of 'AI' onto a product may as well be meaningless for the many and varied uses of what's classed as AI and machine learning today.\nIf you're looking for a new laptop, processor, toaster, or pillow, try to ignore the noise and look out for the genuinely effective features you'll actually use. The truly must-have AI and machine learning features should be pretty obvious.\nPC Gamer Newsletter\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.\nJacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Please try a different type of web browser.\nSamsung\u2019s \u2018AI for All\u2019 Vision Unveiled at CES 2024\nSamsung outlines strategy for using AI technology to make the connected device experience safer, more inclusive, and more energy-efficient\nSamsung Electronics today shared its vision for how artificial intelligence (AI) technology will enable people to experience their devices more intuitively and conveniently than ever before. Presenting these ideas at a press conference at CES\u00ae 2024, Samsung teamed up with key partners to outline the technology behind this vision and how new products and services use AI capabilities to make life easier.\nJong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman, CEO and Head of Samsung\u2019s Device eXperience (DX) Division, opened the press conference by describing how AI will enable connected technologies to improve people\u2019s daily lives while always remaining nonintrusive and \u201cin the background.\u201d The strategy that he and others outlined focused on the role of AI in enhancing connected experiences that are both simple and useful. Throughout the press conference, Samsung presented a number of products and services that help achieve these aims.\n\u201cWith the emergence of artificial intelligence, smarter, better experiences will redefine how we live,\u201d Han said. \u201cSamsung\u2019s broad portfolio of powerful devices, along with the pursuit of open collaboration, will help bring AI and hyper-connectivity to all.\u201d\nAI-Enabled Visual Display Products and Digital Appliances Bring New Experiences to the Home\nDuring the CES press conference, Jonathan Gabrio, Head of Connected Experience Center at Samsung Electronics America, outlined the ways in which AI technology is transforming how Visual Display products and Digital Appliances are used. For example, Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN900D boasts a built-in AI Processor, NQ8 AI Gen 3, equipped with an 8 times greater AI neural network and a two times faster NPU than its predecessor. Thanks to the NQ8 AI Gen3 processor, Samsung Neo QLED 8K automatically upscales low-resolution content to provide users with up to 8K quality viewing experience and sharpens fast-moving images via AI Motion Enhancer Pro. The Samsung Neo QLED 8K also features Active Voice Amplifier Pro, which analyzes voice and background noise by AI to optimize your TV listening experience so you can enjoy various content as if you are in the front row of a stadium or movie theater. Samsung Neo QLED 8K also features Tizen OS Home, which offers the latest apps, services, personalized content, and service recommendations to upscale your entertainment experience.\nAs for viewers with different needs, Samsung also provides innovative accessibility features. A sign language feature in Samsung Neo QLED can be easily controlled with gestures for the hearing impaired, and an Audio Subtitle feature turns text subtitles into spoken words in real-time for those with low vision.\nFurthermore, Samsung is introducing the new The Premiere 8K, a projector that features not only a 150-inch display, but also the world\u2019s first wireless 8K transmission for a projector. With The Premiere 8K, users will be able to enjoy a full-scale viewing experience like that of the cinema in the comfort of their own homes.\nAs for sound, Samsung also introduced Music Frame, a speaker with a customizable cover that integrates seamlessly into users\u2019 homes. Via Q-Symphony, the Music Frame syncs with Samsung TVs and soundbars, bringing enriched bass and surround sound of dual built-in woofers to the home with minimal effort.\nSamsung has also made major upgrades to Ballie, the rolling AI robot first introduced at CES 2020. Ballie has now evolved into your AI companion capable of interacting with other smart devices to provide customized services such as taking care of bothersome tasks or projecting images and videos on walls so that users can view key information for their daily lives such as weather or other relevant content wherever they are.\nTo enhance kitchen and food experiences, Samsung is unveiling the Bespoke 4-Door Flex\u2122 Refrigerator with AI Family Hub\u2122+1 2. This refrigerator boasts a 32-inch screen that features the new AI Vision Inside3, which uses an internal camera to recognize up to 33 different food items that are put into and taken out of the refrigerator and suggests recipes using those ingredients. Users can also set \u201cuse by dates\u201d on the Bespoke 4-Door Flex\u2122 Refrigerator with AI Family Hub\u2122 screen for food items, which then allows the refrigerator to send a notification when the set date draws near. By conveniently helping to save money by reducing food waste, these AI features enable more environmentally conscious lifestyles. The Anyplace Induction range takes AI connectivity a step further, as recipes saved on Samsung Food can be shared to the cooktop\u2019s 7-inch display so that users can easily follow along while cooking.\nSamsung\u2019s AI technology extends to appliances beyond the kitchen, as well. The new Bespoke AI Laundry Combo\u2122 \u2014 an All-in-One washer and dryer \u2014 features the AI Hub4, which is a 7-inch LCD display that acts as an intuitive control center for managing laundry, allowing users to enjoy a simple washing and drying experience. It personalizes washing and drying by remembering users\u2019 habits and using machine learning to suggest cycles. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s upcoming vacuum and mop robot cleaner, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\u21225, utilizes AI technology to provide a more convenient, effective cleaning experience. With AI Object Recognition upgraded from the previous robot cleaner lineup, it will be able to distinguish more objects, as well as detect stains and spaces6. The Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\u2122 also recognizes the type of floor it encounters \u2014 along with carpet length \u2014 and adjusts its settings accordingly.\nSamsung Reveals Galaxy Book4 as Company\u2019s Most AI-Ready Laptop Series Yet\nSamsung has been elevating what a PC can do and has been collaborating with Microsoft to create new, seamless connected experiences. Now, these experiences are being advanced further with new connectivity features that make the Galaxy Book4 series smoother, smarter, and more adaptable, reinforcing Samsung and Microsoft\u2019s commitment to providing the best PC experience possible.\nUsing intelligent, intuitive AI capabilities, Microsoft Copilot7 connects the Galaxy Book4 series with Samsung Galaxy smartphone to make them work seamlessly together, so that it feels like just one device. Microsoft Copilot can find, read or summarize text messages from a user\u2019s Galaxy smartphone and even automatically create and send messages on a user\u2019s behalf directly from the PC. Without having to turn on the smartphone and open each individual app, the Galaxy Book4 series can access smartphone functions and information more quickly and intelligently.\nThe Galaxy Book4 series can now turn Samsung Galaxy smartphones\u2019 powerful camera into a PC webcam8, using it for video calls on virtual conferencing apps. Users can switch freely between front and rear cameras with just a click on their PC, and it also offers a variety of features from Galaxy smartphones \u2013 including Background Blur and Auto-framing \u2013 that help focus on the speaker\u2019s image in any environment.\nThrough tight, ongoing collaboration between Samsung and Microsoft, more intelligent capabilities will continue to be made possible on the Galaxy Book4 series, with the above connectivity features being available starting from March.\nPlus, the Galaxy Book4 series can be paired with other Galaxy devices beyond smartphones. Tab S9 Ultra can be used as an additional PC monitor, and users can enjoy crystal-clear sound quality with reduced latency when the PC is connected with Galaxy Buds2 Pro. With all these capabilities and more, the Galaxy Book4 series is designed to deliver the best PC experience possible.\nBetter Connecting Users and Devices through Spatial Intelligence\nJaeyeon Jung, Executive Vice President and Head of SmartThings, highlighted the exciting new ways in which AI technology is impacting the relationship between users and their devices, including Samsung\u2019s vision for SmartThings: The more Samsung devices a customer uses, the smarter those devices become and the better they can understand and support daily life.\nSpatial AI is the key to enabling this vision, by helping devices understand the living space and routines of the user, thus enabling more a personalized home management experience. SmartThings uses LiDAR9 on connected devices like robot vacuums to create digital floor plans so users can easily check the status and location of all their devices. \u00a0And in March, SmartThings will roll out the upgraded 3D Map View for a more detailed experience on Samsung smartphones and TVs. Furthermore, a simple QR code will allow users to add family and friends to their SmartThings ecosystem, so that every member of the household can create their own routines.\nUsing smart sensors and AI, SmartThings will be able to detect unusual circumstances, such as a fall, and send alerts to designated family and caregivers10. \u00a0Also, thanks to the Galaxy SmartTag2, users can track their pets\u2019 activities and digitally store identifying information by attaching the tag to a collar or harness11.\nAnother point EVP Jung discussed was how the Bixby voice assistant is allowing smart homes to become more dynamic with its enhanced AI capabilities. Bixby can now automatically route commands to the most appropriate devices based on an understanding of the user\u2019s location and activities.\u00a0 Key technologies like Multi Device Wakeup combined with a shared communication protocol, enable Bixby to listen to commands with all the devices in a room but then only perform the requested action on the most relevant device. So if a user is in the kitchen watching a recipe video on their Family Hub\u2122, and they can call out, \u201cHey, Bixby! Play music!\u201d \u00a0At that point, music will play from the user\u2019s smart speaker, but the recipe video will continue to play on the Family Hub\u2122, uninterrupted.\nThe TV, with the Samsung Daily+ service, will increasingly become a central hub for much of this smart home functionality, while also granting access to a variety of additional services. These include video calls through ConnecTime, video veterinary consultation services12, and Workout Tracker \u2014 through which workout data can be transferred to Samsung\u2019s smart watches. Samsung also announced the new Samsung Now+ service, which displays useful information about users\u2019 homes, such as the weather or a live security camera feed from a home security system without the TV even being turned on. \u00a0As is the case with SmartThings features, users can also access this information via voice command.\nBringing the Home and Car Closer Together With Home-to-Car Capabilities\nSamsung also announced developments in the automotive industry, starting with a partnership with Hyundai Motor Group.\u00a0 Samsung and Hyundai have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which was announced ahead of CES 2024. Under the agreement, users will have access to Home-to-Car and Car-to-Home services, courtesy of SmartThings connectivity. Haeyoung Kwon, Head of Infotainment Development Center and SDV13 Execution Sub-Division at Hyundai Motor Group, delivered remarks regarding the partnership.\n\u201cUsing Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s software-defined vehicle, SmartThings will now work with Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis vehicles through the app,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cAll of us at Hyundai Motor Group appreciate our partnership with Samsung, and we\u2019re excited about the new features we\u2019re bringing to your vehicles through smarter connectivity.\u201d\nThrough SmartThings, users will be able to utilize voice commands to remotely perform functions in their car, such as heating it up in advance or opening and closing windows. SmartThings connectivity goes the other way, too, with users able to control home functions from their vehicle. Users will be able to automatically open and close garage doors based on the location of the car, as well as regulate home temperature. All of these actions can be carried out via voice commands.\nAdditionally, Samsung has further deepened the longstanding partnership with HARMAN to elevate the way users experience driving. Michelle Gattuso, Vice President of Product Management at HARMAN, discussed how the two companies are building new technologies to elevate the driving experience.\n\u201cSamsung\u2019s leadership in consumer technology \u2014 together with HARMAN\u2019s automotive expertise \u2014 has opened the door to game-changing experiences like HARMAN Ready Care, Ready Vision and Ready Display,\u201d Gattuso said. \u201cBut now, the work we do with Samsung is getting even more integrated. Samsung and HARMAN are working in lockstep to bring even more impactful experiences to the entire in-cabin ecosystem.\u201d\nHARMAN\u2019s Ready Care, which focuses on driver safety, implements deep learning neural networking techniques to monitor the driver\u2019s movement and cognitive alertness, and can provide personalized reminders and alerts. Additionally, Ready Care can now identify whether passengers are adults or children, and adjust airbag deployment settings accordingly.\nFurthermore, Ready Vision brings an intuitive display directly to windshields \u2014 courtesy of augmented reality \u2014 in drivers\u2019 line of sight, right when they need it. For example, drivers have access to a map that updates according to routes in real time, as well as recommendations for the fastest route or where to stop for coffee. Another HARMAN product, Ready Upgrade, allows automakers to frequently update their vehicle\u2019s hardware and software. This keeps vehicles relevant, modern and efficient for longer.\nSamsung Focuses on Security and Privacy Across Devices\nIn this future of AI-enabled, deeply interconnected devices, Samsung recognizes that security and privacy are paramount. Shin Baik from the Mobile eXperience Security Team discussed the company\u2019s security solutions as a foundation for the hyper-connected era.\nOne such solution is Samsung Knox Matrix, which now provides end-to-end encryption across many Samsung Galaxy smartphones and smart TVs. The technology will allow devices to monitor each other to identify and isolate security threats. Knox Vault, which helps keep user data safe on some of Samsung\u2019s most popular devices, has been expanded to cover more devices connected by SmartThings, such as Samsung Neo QLED 8K TVs. Additionally, Samsung\u2019s partnerships with major tech companies allow users to experience security and privacy in a way that is tailored to their specific needs.\nSamsung Makes Strides in Responsible Materials, Energy Management, and Accessibility\nMeanwhile, Inhee Chung, Vice President of the Samsung Corporate Sustainability Center, highlighted Samsung\u2019s plans for a more circular economy. As part of these plans, Samsung increasingly incorporates recycled materials into its products \u2014 including recycled plastic sourced from discarded fishing nets in Galaxy devices14, recycled plastic in TVs, and recycled aluminum in Bespoke refrigerators15. Additionally, the company\u2019s Certified ReNewed program \u2014 available in the U.S. and select European countries \u2014 offers affordable refurbished phones, while Galaxy Upcycling allows consumers to reuse or repurpose their old phones in creative ways. The company plans to scale up recycling and upcycling, as well.\nAs for the ways Samsung\u2019s technology contributes to sustainability efforts, the company is utilizing AI to make the use of its products more energy-efficient through features like SmartThings AI Energy Mode, which automatically optimizes energy usage to help users save electricity. These features are yet another example of how AI technology will not only make lives easier, but also allow consumers to live in a way that is more environmentally and economically responsible.\nThanks to a new collaboration with Tesla, SmartThings Energy is becoming even more useful both inside and outside of the home. The collaboration has integrated SmartThings Energy with Tesla products, including electric vehicles (EVs), the Powerwall home battery, Solar Inverter and Wall Connector EV charging solution. \u00a0Another benefit is that SmartThings Energy users can take advantage of the Tesla app\u2019s Powerwall \u201cStorm Watch\u201d function, which flags severe weather through SmartThings not only on the Tesla app, but also on users\u2019 connected Samsung TVs and mobile phones. SmartThings can also help users prepare for power outages by activating AI Energy Mode to extend the usage time of backup energy stored in their Tesla Powerwalls.\nSamsung is adding new features to increase device accessibility, such as digital appliances responding to hands-free gestures. Additionally, mobile devices provide auto-generated captions during calls, and TVs and displays offer a new, AI-enabled text-to-speech feature that converts subtitles into spoken audio. To further aid those with low vision, Relumino Together is a new viewing mode on Samsung TVs that enables users of all abilities to watch TV together, with or without visual adjustments.
