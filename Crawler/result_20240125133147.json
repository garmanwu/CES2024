        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Roundup: Automotive Highlights from the World's Largest Tech Show\nSummary\nRelated Articles\nSummary\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is where some of the biggest tech news of the year is announced. More than 4,000 exhibitors are at the show this year, with cutting-edge tech covering nearly every area imaginable. It\u2019s the cars we\u2019re interested in, though, and there were plenty of announcements from automakers ranging from new audio systems to entirely new models. Here are the automotive highlights of CES 2024.\nGoogle Built-In\nGoogle announced updates to Android Auto that would add real-time EV range information to Google Maps. The feature will launch with the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, showing you the estimated battery level at arrival, suggesting charge stops, and estimating charging times along the way. Volvo EVs and some GM EVs already have this feature, and it\u2019s very helpful because it helps curb range anxiety. It adds predictability, offers more choice, and lets you select your route based on your charge without relying on the car\u2019s built-in navigation system.\nGoogle Built-In, the operating system used by Volvo and GM, among others, is adding the Chrome web browser (for use when parked). The system also adds The Weather Channel app to show you the weather along your route.\nHonda EV Concepts\nHonda brought two concept cars to debut what it calls the Honda 0 (Zero) Series, a new line of EVs that will launch in 2026. \u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d said Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nThe concept above with the rectangular nose and gullwing doors is called the Saloon. Its stance is low and wide. Honda says a vehicle based on this concept will arrive in 2026, and it marks not just a new era for Honda electrification, but its styling is nothing like what we've seen from the brand so far.\nThe chunkier concept is called the Space-Hub. Honda didn\u2019t mention if we\u2019d see something in production based on this one, but it might preview what an Odyssey minivan might look like in the future.\nHonda 0 Series models will get the company\u2019s most advanced autonomous driving features. They will also have new e-Axles that the company says will deliver high levels of power and efficiency, along with a battery that Honda says will not degrade more than 10 per cent after 10 years of use.\nHyundai All-In on Hydrogen\nHyundai presented its vision for hydrogen-powered vehicles including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks going forward. The brand remains heavily invested in the tech and plans to develop new large-scale green hydrogen production solutions. It is also concentrating on tech that can deliver hydrogen for vehicles from organic waste (including manure) as well as from melting waste plastics.\nThe company said it expects to have vehicles using 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, enough to drive a passenger vehicle 3 billion km. For reference, passenger vehicle traffic in Canada is approximately 333 billion km per year.\nKia Shows Electric Vans\nKia brought a series of concepts for a future commercial electric van. The Platform Beyond Vehicle concepts offer innovative features like vehicle bodies that can be removed and swapped out quickly. Kia suggests that you could use the van for a taxi by day, a delivery van by night, and a camper on the weekend. Kia emphasized software in the concepts, with the goal of improved charge management and better fleet management. The first planned for production is the PV5, the second largest of the four, built at a new plant capable of handling 150,000 units per year.\nLamborghini Performance Biometrics\nThe Lamborghini Telemetry X concept is in-car tech meant to make you a better driver on track. It captures your biometric data for performance monitoring to help you train off the track and monitors your lap times, lines, and pedal performance to help make you faster. Lamborghini says the system offers proactive voice assistance in the vehicle to help you brake and turn at the right spot.\nMercedes Debuts New Infotainment System\nMercedes-Benz announced that its new MB.OS system, first announced two years ago, will make it into vehicles soon. It will offer an AI virtual assistant that Benz says will \u201ccreate an even more natural and intuitive relationship with the car.\u201d The company says the system will allow more natural interaction with the car\u2019s voice command system. It will also include enhanced 3D graphics for the navigation system that can show the driver hazards around the road. More apps will be added, including games, streaming, and even food-ordering apps.\nIn collaboration with Amazon Music and Audible, Benz will add Dolby Atmos to its Burmester audio systems. Benz says Atmos audio, used in movie theatres to provide a more immersive experience, should do the same for in-car listeners. \u201cImmersive audio storytelling enables our customers to benefit fully from the advanced sound technology in our vehicles. For us, unparalleled in-car entertainment is a further dimension of the hyper-personalized user experience,\u201d said Mercedes-Benz CTO Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\nVinFast Shows Cute EV and Wild Pickup Concept\nElectric startup VinFast Auto brought a pair of concepts including the minicar VF 3 and the VF wild pickup concept.\nThe VF 3 is on sale now in Vietnam and is making its debut for the rest of the world \u2013 though there are no details on Canadian availability. It\u2019s small, about half a metre shorter than a Mitsubishi Mirage, and offers an estimated 202 km of range, which isn\u2019t bad considering the $15k price tag in its home country.\nVinFast\u2019s first pickup, the VF Wild, is likely to be much more relevant to Canadians if it makes it to market. The Wild is about the size of a Honda Ridgeline, but powered by electricity. It offers a flexible bed with a midgate (the new EV pickup hot ticket) that lets you extend the bed by using the back seats of the cab, and it has clamshell doors like the best early 2000s trucks. It\u2019s still just a concept, though, with no announcements of any production plans.\nVolkswagen's New AI Assistant\nVolkswagen announced a new digital assistant called IDA, based on ChatGPT AI. VW says it will control infotainment including navigation as well as climate control. It can also answer general knowledge questions and have a conversation with you. The refreshed Golf will get the feature, along with the ID.3, 4, 5, and ID.7 models, as well as the new Tiguan, with arrivals starting in 2024.\nVW also showed off the refreshed Golf GTI. Though the hot hatch was masked by camouflage, we can see some of the detailing including new head and tail lights.\nRelated Articles\nAbout Us\nDealer Services\nResources\nPartners\nCustomer Support"

Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nAs one of the largest events in the technology space is about to conclude, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 has seen some pioneering innovations in AI and automotive systems.\nCES 2024 saw more than 250 exhibitors display their products and services in automotive technology, primarily focused on clean energy, in-car systems, and autonomous driving.\nWe have shortlisted the top five innovations in this field that aim to transform the user experience in upcoming vehicles.\n5. ChatGPT-enabled infotainment\nVolkswagen announced that it has integrated the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, ushering in a new era in automotive technology.\nThe advancement was enabled by the firm's collaboration with Cerene Inc. via its Chat Pro system. The feature will be offered in the current generation of Volkswagen models based on its MEB and MQB Evo platforms and those that use its IDA voice assistant.\nVolkswagen\nBy integrating with Cerence Chat Pro, the innovation enhances the functionalities of the IDA voice assistant. Users will be able to control a range of functions spanning from infotainment and navigation to air conditioning control, all using voice commands. Additionally, it can also provide answers to general questions, ending those in-car arguments.\nThe integration of ChatGPT through Cerence Chat Pro is designed with a focus on user privacy and data protection by excluding access to any vehicle-specific information.\nThis feature will be accessible across a range of Volkswagen models from early 2024, including the new Tiguan and Passat, the new Golf, and the ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.7.\n4. Honda's 'O' EV lineup\nThe Japanese automaker unveiled its 'Honda 0 Series', a new electric vehicle (EV) lineup set to hit North American roads from 2026 onwards. The company also unveiled a brand-new emblem for the iconic 'H mark'. The emblem will be exclusively reserved for the upcoming generation of EV models.\nTwo concept vehicles in the Honda 0 Series were also premiered at CES 2024 \u2014 Saloon\u00a0and\u00a0Space-Hub. The Saloon represents the leading concept model within its new EV series, developed from the brand's philosophy of being \"Thin, Light, and Wise.\" The model, which is built on a new EV-only platform, features a low-floor, sporty dynamics, and efficient powertrains. The streamlined and futuristic design of the Saloon features a wedged nose, a flowing roofline, gullwing doors, and a high-set rear.\nThe Space Hub was developed\u00a0under the theme of \u201caugmenting people's daily lives\". The car features a panoramic roof and is designed to complement passengers seated facing each other at the back of the vehicle.\nWhile specific details on the powertrain and battery capacities available for the Honda 0 Series were not released, the company claims that all models will feature e-axles, which integrate the motor, inverter, and gearbox into the car's axle. Honda also claims these cars will support rapid charging, with a 15 to 80 percent charge taking less than 15 minutes.\nEnvisioning a greener automotive industry, Honda also shared its intention to make everything it produces and does carbon-neutral by 2050. The company confidently stated that it aims to sell only EVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) globally by 2040.\n3. Sony's updated Afeela EV\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced the updated Afeela, a concept EV that was originally unveiled last year, by driving it onto the stage using a PS5 controller. A joint venture project with Honda as part of Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), the Afeela is an evolution from Sony's Vision S concept.\nIn addition to its remote control operations, the company also showcased a range of updates to the Afeela concept. Along with offering an array of games, the company's collaboration with Epic Games has now enabled augmented reality (AR) mapping. Utilizing data from the car's myriad sensors, and powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 5, SHM now offers immersive 3D maps of the car's surroundings, enhancing safety for occupants.\nSHM also plans to utilize this technology in gaming and entertainment domains as well, for which it is collaborating with virtual reality player Polyphony Digital. The partnership aims to create an immersive experience within the car.\nIn a strategic move, SHM has entered into an agreement with Microsoft, tapping into the Azure OpenAI Service to create a conversational, personal, customized agent for Afeela. SHM is also unlocking the doors of Afeela's developer space to create a platform for creators and developers to innovate and construct applications and services compatible with the EV.\nSHM has announced that it will start taking preorders for Afeela in 2025, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026. With two behemoths in the technology and automotive space joining hands to innovate, we expect much more to come out of the Afeela project in the coming years.\n2. Snapdragon Digital Chassis\nQualcomm Technologies and Robert Bosch GmbH announced the automotive industry\u2019s first central vehicle computer that is capable of hosting both infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities on a single system-on-chip (SoC).\nThe advancement will enable a central system to handle tasks related to safety and security requirements, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving requirements.\nThe cockpit and ADAS integration platform utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an advanced and adaptable solution designed to support mixed-criticality workloads and offer high-performance capabilities. \"With this cost-effective solution, we are paving the way for bringing even more ADAS functions into vehicles, including in the entry-level and mid-range segment,\" said Christoph Hartung, president of the Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division at Bosch, in a statement.\nmetamorworks/iStock\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chasis is already offering a suite of functionalities starting with the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform that provides seamless and secure connectivity, cloud services, and over-the-air updates for vehicles. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform provides immersive experiences with features like high-resolution displays, 3D audio, voice, and gesture recognition, and augmented reality for both drivers and passengers.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon Ride Platform utilizes AI and computer vision to drive advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving features, including lanekeeping, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance. Lastly, the Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud ensures secure and scalable cloud connectivity, data management, and analytics tailored for vehicles.\n1. World's first digital cockpit\nStellantis, BlackBerry QNX, and AWS have teamed up to unveil\u00a0a first-of-its-kind virtual cockpit for automobiles at this year's CES.\nPart of the group's Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW), the platform will greatly accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge car technology to customers. The key to this acceleration lies in the utilization of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which functions as a virtual lab for developing car controls and systems.\nThe platform enables the creation of \"realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, but without needing to change the main software that runs them, taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases,\u201d according to a statement from the company.\nThrough the utilization of QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace, Stellantis can now introduce an advanced simulation of a virtual cockpit into a cloud-based environment. The collaboration between Stellantis and AWS, a prominent cloud services provider, was established in January 2022.\nAccording to Stellantis, the virtual cockpit platform is equipped with impressive tools for the virtualization of graphics, audio, and inputs from the touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. \"Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles, leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it. With our virtual cockpit, we're revolutionizing not just our approach, but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry,\" said Yves Bonnefont, Chief Software Officer at Stellantis, in a statement."

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Highlights: Unveiling the Future of Automotive Technology\nOver the last decade, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has grown to include more carmakers, which makes sense considering how much technology goes into vehicles nowadays. This year sees some far-fetched concepts as well as several innovations that will be available next year. Understandably, electric vehicles are a huge part of the show along with a slew of new entertainment features.\nWhat Automakers Brought to CES 2024\nHonda\nHonda unveiled two concepts: The Saloon and the Space-Hub. These wildly futuristic models showcase the company's creativity while also giving us a sneak peek at what to expect in the near-term. The Saloon is a sleek wedge-like passenger EV that prioritizes lightweight construction and an expansive interior. Instead of a traditional steering wheel, the designers went with a yoke that is intended to be steer-by-wire.\nThe Space-Hub concept has a similar yoke, but that's where the similarities end. This van features a transparent roof, giving passengers the kind of scenic possibilities we'd see in ther observation car of a luxury train. Honda also unveiled a new \"H\" logo that will debut on the first batch of Honda 0 (zero) Series EVs in 2026.\nHyundai\nHyundai typically unveils a futuristic concept at CES, and this year's isn't even intended for the road. Supernal is Hyundai's Advanced Air Mobility company and brought the S-A2, a tilt-rotor electric four-passenger aircraft. It's designed to fly at 120 mph at 1,500 feet, filling the role of an aerial commuter for city trips up to miles. More impressively, the S-A2 is quiet, with a claim of only 65 decibels at takeoff and 45 db when in level flight. There's no word on if or when we'll see one in the air, but Supernal intends to enter the market in 2028.\nHyundai's HTWO brand also unveiled a bold vision of a hydrogen infrastructure, from production to storage and distribution. The strategy also includes provisions to supply hydrogen for industrial and business applications. It all fits in well with Hyundai's goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\nKia\nKia has been sitting toward the vangaurd of EV tech, and at CES 2024, it pulled the covers off a new series of electric vans with some very clever tricks. The modular platform of the Concept PV5 will allow owners to swap out one body for another with relative ease. That means you can use it as a work van for cargo or services, then switch that body for family duties when needed. Production is slated to begin in 2025 and five bodies will be offered: Basic, Van, High Roof, Robotaxi, and Chassis Cab.\nA smaller PV1 will follow it to market, along with a larger PV7. The only problem is Kia hasn't decided if it will bring it to the U.S. yet.\nMercedes-Benz\nMercedes-Benz went big at CES, with a ton of new tech and new partnerships, but the scene-stealer is the Concept CLA-Class that was unveiled last fall. This entry-level EV is a real head-turner, with graceful curves, sleek lines, and delectable details. According to Mercedes-Benz, the production version will inherit as much as 70 percent of the concept's traits and has a target range of 400 miles.\nRapper and producer will.i.am went well beyond his role as a brand ambassador and helped develop the new Sound Drive feature. This system uses specially composed music that is influenced by the driver's actions. Drive with some verve and the music swells, with sound effects mixed in. It sounds cheesy, but we actually got to try it out on the road and can attest, it's pretty cool. In essence, you can play DJ by creating your own mix as you whittle away the miles.\nMercedes' praiseworthy MBUX infotainment system is already one of the best, and the new Virtual Assistant takes it to yet another level. Using advanced artificial intelligence (AI), the feature provides more natural human-like interactions via voice and on-screen. It can be linked to your calendar to keep you on time as well as suggest calling into a meeting if you're running late. It also adjusts the voice to better match the operator's mood, whether they're happy or serious.\nOn the partnership side, Mercedes-Benz joined forces with several companies to deliver more in-car entertainment. Antstream Arcade will bring streaming gaming for when you're charging or making use of the Drive Pilot self-driving feature. Sony Pictures has been brought in to deliver its film library for streaming through the new Ridevu app. Amazon Music and Audible have upped the ante with an immersive sound experience thanks to Dolby Atmos audio. Audiobooks and podcasts will be much more engaging, especially if you try out the \"audio movies\" that are being produced.\nVinfast\nAfter launching the VF8 in the United States last year, Vietnamese carmaker Vinfast showed its VF Wild electric pickup truck concept at CES 2024. There's no word, however, on whether it will make it into production. This midsize truck concept features rear-hinged rear doors, allowing for a positively massive doorway when both doors are open. Also unveiled was the VF3, a tiny two-door SUV, and it is coming to the U.S. and is aiming for 125 miles of range. It's a charming little ute, but Vinfast's rocky start last year has us cautiously optimistic.\nVolkswagen\nVolkswagen announced it will integrate ChatGPT AI into its infotainment system, bringing much more power to voice controls. As with systems in BMWs and Mercedes, it will be capable of natural speech commands when you trigger the system by saying, \"Hello Ida\". Not only can you use it for the typical navigation and feature controls, but also as a tour guide. Want to know about an odd landmark? Just ask. ChatGPT will be available in Volkswagen vehicles later this year, but it's not clear if it will be offered in the U.S.\nRelated Topics\nRead More CarGurus Tips and Advice\nMark Takahashi has been in the automotive world since 2001 and over the years has contributed to Edmunds, Car and Driver, Autoblog, and TrueCar.
