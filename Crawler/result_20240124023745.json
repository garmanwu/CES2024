During the event, there was a notable emphasis on innovation centered around sustainability, reflecting the technology industry's response to evolving societal standards. Here are several noteworthy takeaways from CES 2024, encompassing insights from keynote speakers, breakout sessions, exhibition booths, and discussions in the hallways.\nDefining the Next Era of Beauty Technology\nL'Or\u00e9al CEO, Nicolas Hieronimus, took the stage for beauty companies' keynotes, unveiling several significant announcements.

Hieronimus emphasized L'Or\u00e9al's commitment to innovation saying \u201c\"invention and transformation has been at the heart of our DNA,\u201d while showcasing wearable technology like Scentsation. Another highlight was the Water Saver, L'Or\u00e9al's latest sustainability initiative.\nWalmart\u2019s Vision for the Future\nDuring his CES 2024 keynote session, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, outlined a transformative vision for the future, unveiling several innovative initiatives that are set to reshape the retail landscape. These include AI-Driven shopping experiences such as an AI-powered Exit Experience at Sam\u2019s Club, Shop with Friends, InHome Replenishment, and Retail Search powered by generative AI. Walmart's generative AI tool, \"My Assistant,\" will become more widely accessible to associates worldwide. McMillon also highlighted Walmart's commitment to sustainability by significantly expanding solar usage, aiming to make clean energy more accessible and affordable for households. This reflects Walmart's dedication to a people-first future and contributing to a better world.\nWalmart Activations & Connections Hub\nWalmart is keeping its focus on the future with the introduction of a 4D Experience known as Walmart Activation. It\u2019s a mini ride that takes you into the future of Walmart and delivers to your door via drones. The Connections Hub serves as a meeting space designed for partners and clients to engage in discussions about the future. The unique environment allows for collaboration and exploration of upcoming trends and opportunities.\nAmazon Experience Activation\nIn conversations with Jeffrey Cohen, Principal Evangelist, and Emerson Sklar, Chief Evangelist, of Amazon, the two expressed their enthusiasm about how ambient intelligence is poised to unlock greater freedom, convenience, and possibilities for everyone. The core concept of activation revolves around leveraging technology to simplify life, allowing individuals to focus on family and what truly matters. The activation journey spans from the moment you wake up to when you go to bed, showcasing advanced technology that can detect actions like coughing and automatically adjust air settings and activate humidifiers for optimal comfort.\nAmazon Ads Storytelling Panel and Ludacris After-Dark Concert\nIn a discussion on storytelling hosted by Carly Zipp, Global Director of Brand Marketing at Amazon Ads, the panel, featuring Christian Juhl, Global CEO of Group M, Lauren Anderson, Head of AVOD Original Content & Programming at Amazon Studios, Ronald Gladden, TV Personality, and Stephanie Chang, VP of Content & Global Editor at The Trust, WSJ, shared their favorite impactful books and explored the evolution of storytelling across various mediums.

Ludacris showcased his enduring appeal with crowd-pleasing hits like \"My Chick Bad,\" \"Act a Fool,\" and \"What\u2019s Your Fantasy.\"\nKroger Precision Marketing\nIn the realm of food and grocery retail, Kroger is embracing innovation to enhance the customer experience, aiming for frictionless and inspiration. Cara Pratt, Senior VP of Kroger Precision Marketing, shared insights at CES, highlighting the significant role AI plays in Kroger's current strategy. By leveraging a comprehensive suite of offerings and tapping into its data science capabilities, Kroger is fostering a more connected experience between brands and customers. Brands utilizing Kroger's AI-based audience strategy observed a notable 26% increase in incremental ad spend for their campaigns. Pratt emphasized the opportunity to make ads more relevant, connected, and supportive of customers' lifestyles, catering to preferences ranging from healthier choices to convenience for those leading busy lives.\nAlibaba.com's Smart Assistant\nAlibaba.com introduces new AI features to the Smart Assistant on its global sourcing platform. The Smart Assistant serves as an AI-powered guide, aiding small business owners in discovering opportunities, staying updated on trends, and managing orders efficiently. Launched in September 2023, the Upgraded Image Search and Smart Request for Quotation (RFQ) features have proven beneficial. Users of Upgraded Image Search experienced a 28% higher deal closing rate, and those using Smart RFQ received 29% more quotes from suppliers. Suppliers, in turn, saw a 21% increase in buyer responses to quotes compared to the original RFQ process. To promote entrepreneurial spirit, Alibaba.com has also initiated the \"Entreprenuts\" campaign, in which Helium 10 is participating.\nExpo Hall\nLG made a visually stunning reveal at CES with the introduction of transparent TVs. The LG Signature OLED T can switch between transparent and opaque modes. In transparent mode, it can display art, videos, and data while allowing you to see through it to the surrounding room. When it's time to watch TV, the display transforms, deploying a contrast screen that showcases only the on-screen action. The transparent TV concept opens up new possibilities for integrating technology seamlessly into living spaces. Explore the future of transparent TVs here.\nConnections Hub Chat with Destaney Wishon\nOur own Cassandra Craven caught up with Destaney Wishon in Las Vegas, and among the various topics, Walmart Marketplace\u2019s announcement of Brand Level Targeting took center stage.

        "raw_content": "How Kroger Precision Marketing Continues to Disrupt Media Advertising\nAs retail media continues to build towards a big wave,\u00a0Kroger Precision Marketing (KPM) is riding the crest. Powered by 84.51o, the retail media business of the Kroger Co. is operating across more channels, including channels for retail sales as well as channels for receiving content for entertainment, news and information.\nThe latest: KPM announced that it is opening up access to its onsite advertising inventory by engaging with three preferred ad management platforms. Pacvue, Skai and Flywheel Digital will be the first platforms with access to the application programming interface (API). Through these platforms, KPM aims to make it easier for brands and agencies to find and buy products. Nearly 2,000 brands use KPM product listing ads to reach in-market shoppers on Kroger\u2019s e-commerce sites and to encourage digital purchases.\nKPM\u2019s retail media program includes a host of other ways to target shoppers at touchpoints and households through onsite search, onsite display, advanced television and over-the-top (OTT) services, social and influencer platforms, offsite advertising and email and push notifications. For example, KPM has partnered with Roku, Inc. for closed-loop attribution tools for streaming television, allowing advertisers to focus their dollars on the most relevant TV audience and measure the ad effectiveness through sales. And in late 2021, the business announced a private programmatic advertising marketplace and rolled out the 84.51\u00b0 Collaborative Cloud platform that puts transaction-level data into a privacy-compliant hosted environment.\nData is at the heart of KPM\u2019s retail media initiatives. Using data from Kroger\u2019s loyalty card program across 2,800 stores and 35 states, the division has worked towards enhancing outcome-based marketing for the benefit of all parties, including consumers, content providers and brands.\nCara Pratt, SVP of KPM who sits on the business leadership team at 84.51o, told Progressive Grocer that the convergence of data science and consumers\u2019 buying, browsing and viewing habits is connecting people with items they are more likely to want and use. Her recent presentation at the Food Marketing Conference in Grand Rapids, Mich., on the KPM and Roku connected TV program was well attended and exemplified growing retailer and CPG attention to capabilities that better target shoppers. \u201cThere is interest and intrigue with respect to how first-party data is influencing media buys,\u201d she reported. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a continued cementing of the industry\u2019s recognition that change is active in respect to influencing media.\u201d\nOn the heels of search and social platforms, retail media that enables shoppability is a powerful force, Pratt added. \u201cThere is a connection of content and commerce,\u201d she pointed out.\nKPM is well-positioned to deliver on shoppability and precision marketing, she noted. \u201cWe have created this trust-value equation for decades. Shoppers know that if they have the (loyalty) card, they get intelligent offers, fuel rewards and other things that help make their shopping experience better,\u201d Pratt said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re lining up consumer expectations for seamless shopping and connectivity.\u201d\nAs for the future, even proposed privacy legislation may be less of a hindrance than another way to connect with shoppers at their various need states. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on us that as we are looking to influence change in an industry that is decades old but ripe for a level of productive disruption that it\u2019s all about how all of the players sit around the table and talk about change for the right reasons,\u201d Pratt explained. \u201cIt needs to be a mix across the buy side, sell side and the ad technology element.\u201d\nServing 60 million households annually nationwide through a digital shopping experience, and almost 2,800 retail food stores under a variety of banner names, Cincinnati-based\u00a0Kroger\u00a0is No. 3 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer\u2019s 2021 list of the\u00a0top food and consumables retailers in North America.\nAlso Worth Reading\nKroger Debuts Private Programmatic Advertising Marketplace\n2022 Innovation Outlook: Grocery Gets a Tech Upgrade\nKroger\u2019s Latest Tech Partnership to Move Freshness Initiatives Forward\nAhold Delhaize Strengthens Retail Media Capabilities\nRelated Topics\nStay Fresh.
