Reviews ethics statement\nCES 2024 Health Tech: The Things That May Actually Improve Your Wellness\nFrom improvements in diabetes care to glasses that help you hear, here are the highlights from the world's largest consumer electronics show.\nThese Nuance Audio glasses look like a regular pair, but they're built to help you hear better.\nNew health and wellness technology can be an attractive sell because, well, who doesn't want to feel better? At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

Its innovative form factor designed for women's fingers, focus on helping women track and analyze their health and fitness, and emphasis on big-picture data interpretation rather than individual activity scores sets Evie apart from other wearables. It has a fresh approach to tracking and displaying key health and wellness metrics such as menstrual cycles, sleep stages, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and enables the logging of\u00a0information, including menstrual symptoms, mood, and workouts through the emotionally intelligent Evie App to provide personalized insights that empower women with actionable data to help them make informed health decisions.\nMovano Health's \u00a0commitment to offering accurate health data is demonstrated by its recent FDA application for SpO2 and heart rate for a ring medical device. The submission is a testament to the company's dedication to delivering health tools that women can trust.\n\"Earning the CES Innovation Award is a momentous achievement for us and reinforces the importance of our mission,\" said John Mastrototaro, CEO of Movano Health. \"As highlighted by the increasing emergence of women's health initiatives such as the one recently announced by the White House, women have traditionally been underserved in the healthcare market and there's a shifting focus towards closing this gap. With Evie, we aim to provide women with more accessible and actionable health data to help them live healthier lives.\"\nMovano Health will showcase the Evie Ring at CES Unveiled on January 7, 2024. During CES, Movano Health will also be demonstrating the breakthrough results of its most recent blood pressure clinical trial in which its cuffless prototype and proprietary 4 x 6.7mm System-on-a-Chip demonstrated a level of accuracy within the standards recognized by the FDA for blood pressure monitoring devices, a major step forward in its plans to commercialize a cuffless blood pressure wearable.\nFurthermore, Movano Health is making headway in its non-invasive glucose monitoring initiative. The Company's patented radio frequency-enabled technology provides meaningful advantages over traditional optical sensors with superior accuracy and reliability, which is agnostic to skin tone.\nThe Evie Ring is now available for $269 and no subscription fees exclusively at https://eviering.com/.\nAbout Movano Health\u00a0\u00a0Founded in 2018, Movano Inc. (Nasdaq: MOVE) dba Movano Health is developing a suite of purpose-driven healthcare solutions to bring medical-grade, high-quality data to the forefront of consumer health devices.

        "raw_content": "Movano\u2019s smart ring is the rare CES health gadget that will actually ship\nMovano\u2019s smart ring is the rare CES health gadget that will actually ship\nI got a chance to spend some time with the women-focused ring at CES, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a health tech gadget actually make it to consumers.\nBy\nVictoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\nShare this story\nThere\u2019s always a certain degree of vaporware at CES. It comes with the territory \u2014 especially when we\u2019re talking about ambitious health tech that requires regulatory clearance. So it was really neat that after two years, I got to actually hold Movano\u2019s Evie smart ring in my hands ahead of the first wave of units shipping out to customers later this month.\nThe Evie Ring\u2019s approach to health tracking has a twist. With wearables, women often feel like an afterthought in design. Just look at smartwatches. Usually, companies prioritize bigger sizes to extend battery life at the expense of those with smaller wrists. The Evie Ring, however, is one of the few woman-first wearables, and that clearly shows up in the design.\nRelated\nHolding the ring in hand, you can see it has an open gap that slightly flexes to account for finger swelling \u2014 something that can happen in warmer temperatures or as a result of hormonal changes. From an engineering standpoint, that\u2019s actually pretty impressive given the number of sensors and flexible batteries that you need to stuff into such a tiny form factor.\nI also dig that it has an actual case, kind of like earbuds. The Oura Ring comes with a small charging stand, and my cats have knocked it \u2014 and therefore the ring \u2014 off my nightstand and under my bed one too many times. Movano says that the ring itself has an estimated battery life of roughly four days, and that the case itself holds up to 10 full charges.\nMeanwhile, the companion app also includes period tracking and mood logging, which will eventually power AI-based insights based on correlations between menstrual health, hormones, energy, sleep, and activity.\nStacy Salvi, Movano Health\u2019s vice president of product and strategy, says the company\u2019s built an AI framework that will allow it to pull insights from different types of data. \u201cSo if a woman experiences more restless sleep during the luteal phase per cycle, we\u2019re going to point that out. Some people actually experience better sleep during their cycle and so we\u2019d point that, too. We have actually have different insights on each of those.\u201d\nSince Movano is a smaller company, those types of insights will at first rely on users logging moods. Once enough of a database is built up, then those AI insights will come a lot more naturally with time, Salvi says. Other planned features include a health report that can be shared with doctors, automatic activity detection for workouts, and Android support in the second quarter of the year. (At first, the Evie Ring will be iOS only.)\nAt launch, the ring will be able to do both spot checks and passive overnight readings for SpO2, or blood oxygen. That\u2019s fairly standard for wearables these days, but the more compelling thing to me is that Movano has made it a point to use medical-grade sensors, build the device at a medical device manufacturing facility, and seek FDA clearance for its pulse oximeter.\nAs far as FDA clearance goes, technically Movano still hasn\u2019t gotten it. The company filed for 510(k) clearance in summer 2023 for blood oxygen and heart rate and is in the process of going back and forth to address concerns. That said, that won\u2019t mean the Evie will launch with any features missing. Movano spokesperson Matt Bevenour says FDA clearance is merely to show users that the Evie Ring meets the regulator\u2019s standards for accuracy. Once clearance is granted, Movano plans to transition from a wellness to medical device.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going really well. We\u2019re in communication with the FDA, and we\u2019re looking forward to getting that cleared,\u201d Salvi says. She says that, so far, the ring has exceeded FDA standards in testing.\n\u201cThe DNA of the company is medical-based,\u201d Salvi says, pointing to Movano CEO John Mastrototaro\u2019s background in helping to create the very first continuous glucose monitor. Salvi also noted that getting clearance presents future business opportunities as the line between wearables and medical devices blurs further.\nThe Evie Ring is available for iOS users to buy now. It\u2019ll cost $269 with no subscription and comes in gold, silver, and rose gold.

The Evie Ring is a 2024 CES Innovation Award Honoree in the Wearables category.\nams OSRAM\u2019s complete PPG sensor solution, which consists of the Optical Front End (OFE) SFH 7014c emitter and SFH 2705 detector technology coupled with the company\u2019s Analog Front End (AFE) AS7057, is able to achieve an increased total radiant intensity of more than 40 percent over the previous generation products and its photodetector has a surface area that is significantly larger than competing products. This allows for much more sensitive and accurate readings, overcoming the challenges that all biometric monitoring devices face: accurate detection of micro modulations of small light signals, results of scattering and absorption in tissue and amount of light emitted by LEDs, which strongly affect system performance. This supports Evie\u2019s objective to deliver a device uniquely built for women\u2019s fingers.\n\u201cOur world-class engineers have designed the Evie Ring for women who typically have smaller fingers, and lower perfusion. In order to ensure a best-in-class experience when it comes to collecting data from the finger, we needed a cutting edge solution on both the optical and analog side. The ams OSRAM solution enables us to meet the unique needs of our consumer,\u201d said Michael Leabman, Founder and CTO of Movano Health. \u201cEnsuring an accurate signal is tantamount to delivering trusted results and actionable insights.\u201d\n\u201cOur accurate optical sensors and advanced capabilities of our analog front end enable a miniaturized yet highly accurate PPG (Photoplethysmography) system. Through our carefully engineered technologies, we are able to offer a complete PPG sensor solution comprised of the industry\u00b4s smallest analog front end sensor AS7057 with market leading compact multi-emitter SFH 7014c and SFH 2705 for precise health monitoring.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best wearable and fitness tech of CES 2024: from smart rings to AI coaches\nWomen-first tech and automatic glasses stood out at CES\nEvery year CES \u2013 the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 introduces us to a treasure trove of innovative technologies, and that\u2019s no truer than in the fitness and wearables category. CES 2024 has been no different.\nAt last year\u2019s conference, we saw a displayless smartwatch, smart beds for athletes, and an at-home pee tester (kinda yucky, but potentially a handy health accessory).\nThis year we (thankfully) don\u2019t have toilet-based gadgets we want to highlight, but there are plenty of other fitness and wearable gadgets we\u2019ve loved finding out more about \u2013 and have even got hands-on time with to see if they can live up to the hype.\nHere are some of the best wearables and fitness tech from CES 2024 including a glove that counters Parkinson\u2019s tremors, fitness headphones with an in-built AI coach, and a smartwatch we could see surviving anything.\nSmartwatches at CES 2024\nThere\u2019s usually a handful of smartwatches on display at CES, typically sleek sophisticated-looking things that combine fitness tracking with an elegant electronic timepiece.\nThat\u2019s true of the newly announced Garmin Lily 2 which boasts a \u201cpetite, fashionable\u201d smartwatch design \u2013 coming in at just 20.6g \u2013 and a hidden display that shows a patterned background until tapped. It\u2019s also plenty useful with connected GPS \u2013 although no built-in GPS, which would have been a huge upgrade for runners and cyclists over the original Garmin Lily \u2013 as well as five days of battery life, sleep scores, menstrual cycle tracking, and a pulse oximeter for checking your blood oxygen levels. It\u2019s available now for $249.99 / \u00a3249.99, with Australia prices TBC.\nGarmin also launched the HRM-Fit heart rate monitor which has been tailored specifically for people who wear medium and high-support sports bras. It offers all the same real-time workout information tracking in a package that should be more comfortable for sports bra wearers than traditional Garmin heart rate monitors.\nIf you instead want a smartwatch that looks like it would survive a nuclear explosion there\u2019s the Casio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000. It features heart rate monitoring, a pulse oximeter, built-in GPS, and Casio's Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing, and temperature. Casio\u2019s smartwatch can also give you sunrise and sunset times, and global tide data making though it comes at a price. When it launches on January 20 it\u2019ll set you back $500 / \u00a3449 (around AU$750).\nSmart rings at CES 2024\nSmart rings are becoming all the rage \u2013 they\u2019re like fitness watches but pack all of their health-tracking sensors into a ring that\u2019s a lot less bulky and distracting.\nThe 4g Amazfit Helio ring is coming to claim Oura\u2019s crown at the top of our best smart rings list with its promises of detailed sleep tracking and readiness scoring that could help you improve your running and cycling workouts. Though to access its premium analysis features you\u2019ll need to pay $69.99 (approx \u00a375 / AU$105) per year.\nConversely, the women-first Evie smart ring offers a one-and-done approach. The ring is not only packed with helpful trackers for sleep, blood oxygen, and heart health, but it also has an AI that can look at this info as well as logs related to your menstrual cycle, mood, and activity levels to provide insight on what has positive impacts on your health \u2013 such as noting that the days you log more steps than average are days your mood is higher.\nIt even has an open ring design to account for the changes in women\u2019s finger sizes at different points in their menstrual cycle. The Evie smart ring launches later this January but only in the US for $269.\nFitness headphones at CES 2024\nMusic can be a powerful workout tool with powerful tunes helping you to push through a workout, or distract you from how tired you\u2019re feeling on your long run. But Mojawa\u2019s new bone conduction headphones want to take things further with an AI sports trainer who can help you take your training further, apparently.\nWith vibration-based training guidance Mojawa\u2019s HaptiFit Terra headphones\u2019 AI \u201celevate workouts into complete training sessions with automatically generated exercise plans.\u201d How this looks in practice is anyone\u2019s guess but when it launches in the next couple of months \u2013 the official release date is Q1 2024 \u2013 we should find out.\nThe gadget is currently on presale for $199.99 / \u00a3239.99 \u2013 slightly cheaper than the $299.99 retail price (Australian and UK release prices to come in the future). On top of the AI you\u2019ll get headphones with an IP68 water resistance rating and 32GB of on-board music storage that\u2019s controlled by pressure-sensitive haptic controls.\nSennheiser also introduced a new set of Momentum Sport headphones, with built-in fitness tracking and PPG heart rate sensor, as well as the full range of Polar's impressive fitness metrics. The Sport buds go on sale on the 9th of April with a selling price of $329.95 / \u20ac329.99 / around AU$492.14.\nHealth wearables at CES 2024\nThe most innovative health tech shown off at CES can be a total game changer for the people it helps. In the case of the GyroGlove it\u2019s helping to give people suffering from Parkinson's some of their independence back.\nBy working to counter her tremors Roberta Wilson-Garrett \u2013 a person with Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 told us that she can make herself a cup of tea, button her shirt, and eat something using utensils thanks to the FDA Class-1 approved glove. In a live demonstration, we saw a stark contrast between her ability to draw with and without the glove.\nThe GyroGlove is available to buy right now \u2013 though each hand will cost you $5,899 (around \u00a34,600 / AU$8.800) \u2013 but CES is also a chance to see the future of health tech, like the Vixion 01 specs.\nThis sci-fi visor isn\u2019t yet another Apple Vision Pro competitor. They\u2019re glasses that can automatically correct your vision so whatever you\u2019re looking at is always in focus. The clear advantage being you\u2019d only need to buy one pair of specs for the rest of your life. If your vision changes the Vixion 01 will adjust itself so you can still see with perfect clarity. The only downside is we don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll release, or how much it\u2019ll be at launch.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

The Evie Ring is a 2024 CES Innovation Award Honoree in the Wearables category.\nams OSRAM\u00b4s complete PPG sensor solution, which consists of the Optical Front End (OFE) SFH 7014c emitter and SFH 2705 detector technology coupled with the company\u00b4s Analog Front End (AFE) AS7057, is able to achieve an increased total radiant intensity of more than 40\u00a0percent over the previous generation products and its photodetector has a surface area that is significantly larger than competing products. This allows for much more sensitive and accurate readings, overcoming the challenges that all biometric monitoring devices face: accurate detection of micro modulations of small light signals, results of scattering and absorption in tissue and amount of light emitted by LEDs, which strongly affect system performance. This supports Evie's objective to deliver a device uniquely built for women's fingers.\n\"Our world-class engineers have designed the Evie Ring for women who typically have smaller fingers, and lower perfusion. In order to ensure a best-in-class experience when it comes to collecting data from the finger, we needed a cutting edge solution on both the optical and analog side.
