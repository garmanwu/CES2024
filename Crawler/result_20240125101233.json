        "raw_content": "Equinix opens doors on new Ashburn, Va. data center\nEquinix has enlarged its footprint in the Washington D.C. area with the opening of its 16th International Business Exchange (IBX) data center, DC21.\nEquinix broke ground on DC21 a little over a year ago. With the addition of the DC15 data center, which opened earlier this year, Equinix has invested more $200 million in the Washington D.C. area this year.\nEquinex's new Washington D.C. area data centers are part of its data center campus in Ashburn, Va. \u00a0As a strategic communications hub for the eastern U.S. as well as a major gateway to Europe, Ashburn is one of the largest peering points in North America and one of the largest in the world. In addition to colocation and data centers, Ashburn, which is located in Loudoun County, is also a key hub for hyperscale cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services.\nLoudoun County\u2019s \u201cdata center alley\u201d is the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, with more than 18 million square feet currently in operation and millions more being planned or developed.\nEquinix's 16 IBX data centers house more than 200 network service providers, which is more than any other data center provider in the\u00a0Washington D.C.\u00a0metro area.\nThe Citadel, which is owned by Switch, is currently the largest data center campus in the world. It's located in Nevada, and its campus covers an area of 7.2 million square feet. It also has the largest data center building, Tahoe Reno 1, with 1.3 million square feet of space, surpassing the previously held record by Lakeside Technology at 1.1 million square feet.\nThe $95 million first phase of DC21 will provide more than 41,000 square feet of colocation space, offering an initial capacity of 925 cabinets. Upon completion of the planned future phases, DC21 is expected to provide total capacity of 3,100 cabinet equivalents and colocation space of more than 124,000\u00a0square feet.\nDC21, which has the headroom to expand to six data halls, is located on 34-acres, which gives Equinix the room to build up to three more IBXs. In an email to FierceTelecom, Equinix said the dates for the remaining phases of expansion in DC21 would be determined based on overall capacity needs.\nThe $111 million\u00a0first phase of DC15 opened in the second quarter of this year with an initial capacity of 1,600 cabinet equivalents and colocation space of approximately 23,000 square feet.\nThe expansion of the Equinix's Ashburn Campus also included a Co-Innovation Facility (CIF), which allows technology vendors to test, demonstrate and evolve their products by working with Equinix. \u00a0The Equinix Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) elements are already in use at DC15 and in other IBXs as well.\nA few\u00a0examples of technology innovations being developed at the Equinix CIF include using fuel cell technology, using next generation cooling, deploying software-defined power and testing new sensors that increase sustainability.\nRELATED: Equinix takes the wraps off of new bare metal service\nThe Washington D.C. area is also one of four markets that offer Equinix Metal. Based off of its deal to buy Packet earlier this year, Equinix announced the availability of its Equinix Metal platform early last month.\nEquinix blended Packet's bare metal technology with its Equinix Fabric, which was previously known as Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, to spin up bare-metal servers in under 15 minutes. Equinix Fabric provides access to a software-defined interconnection service spanning 237 data centers deployed near major internet exchanges across 46 geographies.\nEquinix Metal provides digital businesses with an automated \"as-a-service\" model, which gives companies the option to deploy the physical infrastructures of their choice at \"software speed\" across Equinex's platform. With Equinix Metal, businesses can click-and-configure their services via an API and common libraries, or leverage the tools that they are already using to manage infrastructure-as-code."

Establishing subsidiaries in Dongguan, Japan and Vietnam, SHIN TECH LIMITED is mainly engaged in electronic products, automotive electronics, plastic injection molding. NEOTEC has grown from a factory building with more than 300 employees into a collectivized company with more than 10,000 employees and an annual output value of more than HKD 20 billion. Since 2014, it has become one of the top ten export enterprises in Dongguan and has won many awards from national, provincial and municipal governments.\nAs a typical OEM factory, NEOTEC mainly gains profits from OEM business. The original manual analysis and production scheduling, manual checking of materials, and whole work order based preparation material lead to low efficiency and great quality risks, which greatly affects the delivery of products to the customers. Its order structure mainly shows the following characteristics:\nThe high mix low volume production mode reveals that about 100 customers are actually served every year, but more than 10,000 product types are produced. The whole work order based material preparation mode leads to extensive cutting and material loss.\nMore than 300 work orders are produced at the same time every day, and each line has 8~10 changeovers per day on average. All materials are fed during each changeover, resulting in a long changeover time, with an average of more than 30 minutes.\nThe JIT mode is introduced to solve the problem of extensive cutting and material loss:\nbreak away from the traditional mode of the whole work order based material cutting and preparation, and adopt the first set + JIT mode with minimum packaging preparation. After the first set of materials is prepared, the system conducts real-time monitoring of production progress and material usage based on equipment networking, and promptly notifies the warehouse personnel of production line low material warning information through the mobile terminals and all kinds of kanban. The warehouse personnel then prepares the materials according to the warning information, and deliver the materials to the production line through AGV or material vehicles, forming the JIT mode.\nThe intelligent production switchover solution is introduced to optimize the changeover process and solve the problem of long changeover time:\nbreak away from the traditional mode of feeding all materials during changeover. The system conducts an intelligent analysis on the material sharing of previous and next work orders, and recommends an intelligent production switchover solution. The shared materials will be automatically transferred to the next work order, and the system will give reminders of material differences to reduce repeated material preparation, return and feeding of extensive shared materials.\nThrough the application of JIT pull feeding and intelligent production switchover, the line changeover time is reduced from 30 minutes to 10 minutes, and the comprehensive production efficiency improved by 13%, generating an annual new output value of nearly RB 100 million.\nIn the first phase, 80 employees are reduced in the warehouse and production lines, marking a direct employee reduction of 28%, saving RMB 6.4 million/year of labor costs.\nThe inventory of self-purchased materials is reduced by 30%, WIP reduced by nearly 60 million, and all kinds of paper production statements reduced from 1140 copies to 0 copy.\nEpson Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd\nShenzhen,Guangdong\nHodgen Technology Co., Ltd\nWuxi\uff0cJiangsu\nByd Industrial Co.
