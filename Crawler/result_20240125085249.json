The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design. Those rated the highest across all categories receive the Best of Innovation designation.\nFor the CES 2024 program, the top two categories by number of submissions were \u2018digital health\u2019 and \u2018sustainability, eco-design & smart energy.\u2019 This trend underscores the rapid pace of innovation in sectors that promise to solve big global challenges and improve human lives \u2013 a major theme at the show as CTA partners with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS) to advance human security. For the first time, the Best of Innovation list for CES 2024 includes a product from the \u2018Human Security\u2019 category, introduced at CES 2023.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards also features a new category \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). The AI category received 7% of all applications, underscoring that innovators are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of technology. AI will also be pervasive throughout the CES 2024 show floor and conference programming.\nThe full Best of Innovation list and all 522 Innovation Award honorees will be announced during CES 2024, where many of the products will appear in the Innovation Awards Showcase at CES, located in the Venetian Expo.\nThe Best of Innovation honorees for 2024 include:\nAirFarm\nCompany: Midbar Co., Ltd.\nProduct Category: Human Security for All\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAirJet\u00aeMini \u2013 Solid-State Active Cooling Chip for Electronic Devices\nCompany: Frore Systems\nProduct Category: Embedded Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAVEIR\u2122 Dual chamber (DR) Leadless Pacemaker System\nCompany: Abbott\nProduct Category: Digital Health\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nCompany: Bose\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nFINTIN V1 : The Most Accessible Qwerty-Communicator\nCompany: ONECOM.CO.,LTD.\nProduct Category: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nGun Detection System\nCompany: Bosch\nProduct Category: Artificial Intelligence\nHestia\nCompany: VAONIS\nProduct Category: Digital Imaging/Photography\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHonda Motocompacto\nCompany: Honda\nProduct Category: Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHP Spectre Fold\nCompany: HP Inc.\nProduct Category: Computer Hardware & Components\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nIINK - 4D Food Printing System for Future Food\nCompany: Top Table Inc.\nProduct Category: Food & AgTech\nInteractive Transparent Window\nCompany: AUO Corporation\nProduct Category: In-Vehicle Entertainment\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nITX181225\nCompany: I-TEN SA\nProduct Category: Sustainability, Eco-Design & Smart Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nJBL Authentics 500\nCompany: Harman International Corp\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nMand.ro Mark 7D\nCompany: Mand.ro Co.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

At CES 2024, we can expect to see everything from TVs to laptops, from smartphones to smart tractors. Basically if it runs off of electricity, it'll be at the show.\nCES 2024 technically starts tomorrow, but there have already been a ton of announcements, and the week is just getting started. We're live on the show floor, though, and we'll continue to update this article each day with the latest CES 2024 announcements.. Not everything will actually come to market, but we will get a pretty good idea what products will look like over the next year or so.\nCES 2024: When Is It Happening?\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST). However, unlike many other trade shows which are all about the main keynote, CES is a more prolonged beast. Tech manufacturers from all over the world will have their own keynotes, or will just have gadgets on the show floor to show off.\nThis is why it's a good idea to stay tuned to IGN, as we'll be keeping our eyes open for the strange new technology that is scattered around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nWhat is CES?\nCES stands for the Consumer Electronics Show, an annual industry-only tradeshow that features all the newest technology coming to market over the next couple of years. The show isn't really meant to show new products per se, but rather the tech and trends that are going to be powering the new products.\nEverything Announced at CES 2024 So Far\nNvidia Launches Super-Powered Graphics Cards\nNvidia has announced three new graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super, replacing the RTX 4080, 4070 Ti and 4070, respectively. This is a classic mid-generation refresh looking to convince more folks to upgrade their PCs. The first of these cards to hit the market will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, which comes out on January 17, but don't worry, all three will be out by the end of the month.\nMSI Is Here to Claw Some of the Handheld Gaming PC Market From Asus and Valve\nThe best handheld gaming PCs are here to stay, and the latest is the MSI Claw. Rather than being powered by the AMD Z1 chip, like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally, the Claw is powered by the new Intel Core Ultra processor, backed by Intel Arc graphics. Onboard graphics are usually a bad word when it comes to PC gaming, but this time around both Intel and MSI seem confident in what this chip can do. I know I'm excited to put it through its paces, and see how it compares to the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally.\nApple Swoops In With a Surprise Vision Pro Announcement\nWhile Apple technically isn't here in Las Vegas for CES, the Cupertino giant did take some of the spotlight when it suddenly announced a release date for the Apple Vision Pro, the company's take on a VR/AR headset. Preorders for the headset go live January 19th, and it will officially hit the market on February 2. That's not much longer to wait for a product that we thought was going to keep getting pushed back. Let's just hope it's worth that $3,499 price tag.\nSony and Honda Drive Cars With a DualSense Controller\nSony and Honda teamed up at CES to show off the Honda Afeela driven with a Sony DualSense controller. That's exciting for sure, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just a tech demo and not something that is guaranteed to come to market. And, honestly, it's probably safe to assume it will, at least any time soon. Doesn't stop it from looking cool as hell, though.\nWhat To Expect From CES 2024\nTL;DR: Here's What to Expect\nIt's hard to even think about CES 2024 without bringing up AI. Not only have AI-based language models like Chat GPT been the center of conversation all year, but both Intel and AMD have announced new processors that'll have silicon dedicated to AI workloads. Couple that with the fact Apple has had a Neural Engine built into its processors since the M1 hit the market in 2020 means that LLMs (language learning models) and AI-based image generation are going to be processed locally on the best laptops, rather than in the cloud.\nDon't worry, gaming is totally going to be affected by this too. Ever since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in 2019, Nvidia's graphics cards have shipped with Tensor Cores which are purpose-built to handle machine learning workloads. This is the hardware behind the hugely-successful DLSS, or Deep-Learning Super Sampling. So, you can expect Nvidia to show up in Vegas to show off what's coming next for their own special AI upscaling secret sauce.\n2023 has also been huge for handheld gaming. The Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have all made waves for basically being a Nintendo Switch that can run all your favorite Steam games on the go. However, all of these systems are basically using the same AMD Z1 chipset. It'd be nice to see AMD come out with a new chipset that can show off the next generation of handheld gaming. Or, even better, if Nvidia or Intel came out with something similar that can introduce some competition to that space.\nBeyond gaming, we're likely to hear something from smartwatch manufacturers, especially after Apple announced it would stop selling its flagship smartwatches, according to a report from 9to5Mac. This comes via a lawsuit around Apple using imported blood oxygen level-monitoring technology. So, either we're going to see a new company take on this challenge or we're going to at least hear some kind of discussion about how best to move forward.\nCES 2024 is going to be full of surprises too. Every year the LVCC show floor is packed with inventive little gadgets that really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as we'll keep it updated with the coolest tech CES 2024 has to offer.\nIGNRecommends"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: all the GPUs, monitors, and laptops to expect\nCES remains a big show in the world of computing. We still live in an era when all the biggest names in PCs show up to the event trying to outdo each other, which always makes it exciting as onlookers.\nFrom the looks of it so far, CES 2024 looks to be a big one. A slew of new PC hardware, laptops, gaming laptops, monitors, and much more are bound to be announced. Here\u2019s what to expect from the show and what we know so far.\nNvidia, AMD, and Intel\nJanuary 8, 2024.8AM PT.\n\ud83d\udcfa: https://t.co/OQiFvriGdw pic.twitter.com/UZ0uNjknDE\n&mdash; NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) January 4, 2024\nNvidia plans to have a big presence at the show this year. Its virtual presentation starts at 8 a.m. PT on Monday morning, the media day before CES officially kicks off. What the company will be talking about this year is no secret. The RTX 40 Super desktop GPUs have been fully leaked now for months, followed by official teasers from the company. At this point, the new cards feel like the closest thing we have to a guarantee.\nSo yes, the RTX 4080 Super, 4070 Ti Super, and 4070 Super are rumored to all get launched, along with a lot of talk around AI, of course. Notably, there don\u2019t appear to be any mobile GPUs being announced this year, so don\u2019t expect the RTX 50 series\u00a0to get kicked off just yet.\nAMD\u2019s keynote is happening just before Nvidia at 7 a.m. PT in a presentation titled \u201cTogether we advance AI.\u201d AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su will be hosting, along with the general manager of computing and graphics, Jack Huynh. You can expect the general topic of AI to be a focus, though leaks around the impressive performance of new Ryzen 8000 APUs look promising, too.\nEither way, don\u2019t expect an entire line of new GPUs to combat Nvidia\u2019s announcements, though there are rumors that AMD will bring a more budget-friendly desktop GPU, the Radeon RX 7600 XT. The rumored card would use the Navi 32 GPU and fill the gap between the RX 7700 XT and RX 7600.\nLastly, Intel\u2019s presentation will be at 3 p.m. PT on Monday afternoon. Having already announced its Meteor Lake processors in December, this year\u2019s CES keynote may be focused on the broader topics of AI. CES Pat Gelsinger will be hosting, where \u201cIntel technologies, supported by innovative and open software, enable AI capabilities for consumers and businesses to create a better, responsible, more sustainable, and more inclusive future for all.\u201d\nRumors also point to a 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh to sit alongside Meteor Lake, having been mentioned in leaks recently. How Intel will position these chips will be fascinating, especially due to how much effort it put behind the Core Ultra rebrand.\nLaptops\nThe timing with laptop refreshes this year has been a bit awkward. They are usually aligned with announcements from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, but with Nvidia out of the question, most of the attention is around Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake \u201cCore Ultra\u201d rollout. The major announcements around the launch have already been made in December, along with a host of new laptops to support, such as the Acer Swift Go. But we can expect another slate of laptops from the usual suspects to get announced.\nDell already announced its shake-up to the XPS line this week, introducing the new XPS 13, 14, and 16, as well as some new UltraSharp monitors. If you believe the leaks, there\u2019s much more on the Alienware front, too. Expect laptop manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Asus, Razer, and many more to have new devices to share. Because there are no mobile GPU announcements expected, however, gaming laptops will largely be based on last year\u2019s GPUs, such as the RTX 40-series.\nRegardless, you can pretty much guarantee that nearly every single new laptop will be marketed as an AI PC, even if that concept feels increasingly like a misnomer.\nMonitors\nGaming monitors have become quite a buzzy topic at CES over the last few years, especially as the race to adopt more advanced panel technology has sped up. Companies like Samsung Display and LG are usually in attendance with new panels, partnered with all the manufacturers, whether that\u2019s Samsung Electronics, Asus, or Dell. Some of the biggest announcements have already been made, such as LG\u2019s dual-refresh rate 480Hz OLED monitor.\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that OLED will be the name of the game, but seeing how these companies can push the technology even further is always of interest. Look at Acer\u2019s 27-inch 3D monitor, which was announced last fall and provides a glasses-free 3D experience. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see more monitor technology like this that takes the technology in new directions and further improves things we\u2019re used to, like resolution, refresh rate, and backlighting.\nXR headsets, peripherals, desktops, and much more\nWith Apple\u2019s Vision Pro waiting in the wings with a rumored launch in February, don\u2019t be surprised if we see some of the competition ramping up, too. Mixed-reality headsets and corresponding VR technology are always a fun part of CES, especially the more experimental releases. Now that Apple has used the term expect the topic of spatial computing to be the talk of the town.\nBeyond that, you can expect your usual assortment of new mice, keyboards, desktop PCs, PC components, and other accessories to flood the Las Vegas Convention Center halls, hoping to stand out enough to make a splash. Which will? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nExternal GPUs are great, but are limited by the bandwidth of Thunderbolt. At CES 2024, Lenovo has announced a proprietary port and external GPU with a full PCIe connection to get more out of your desktop GPU.\nIt's TGX, or the ThinkBook Graphics Extension, and it is capable of transferring up to 64Gbps data throughput. This is similar to what Asus achieved with its ROG XG Mobile interface, which is supported by various ROG gaming notebooks as well as the ROG Ally handheld.\nThe Alienware 34 QD-OLED took the world by storm. As the first really great OLED gaming monitor, it had little in the way of competition.\nBut in 2024, that's not true. And to keep its lead, Alienware has launched two new QD-OLED gaming monitors that take things even further. There is now a 32-inch 4K model (AW3225QF) and a 27-inch QHD model (AW2725DF), both of which use the second-generation QD-OLED tech from Samsung Display. I got to see both models in person at a preview event ahead of CES 2024, and I came away extremely excited for these new gaming monitors.\nThe Alienware m16 is only on its second generation, but the company is already hitting the reset button on the design. The m16 R2, announced at CES 2024, has both a redesigned chassis and reengineered thermals, plus one very notable feature never seen in an Alienware gaming laptop.\nMost Alienware laptops have proudly featured a \"thermal shelf\" on the back, which purportedly helped with air ventilation and positioned the ports out of the way. The problem with the thermal shelf is the extra size it adds to the footprint of the laptop. It also adds a rather large bottom chin and hinge under the screen -- and sometimes results in a small palm rest and touchpad.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 day 3: the 9 best gadgets we've seen, from the LG C4 OLED to neural headphones\nOur highlights from another eventful day at CES 2024\nIt may already be day three of CES 2024, but the tech announcements show no sign of slowing down \u2013 in fact, after hours of scouring the show floor, we're discovering more hidden gems than ever after the big keynote announcements earlier this week.\nWe've already rounded up the best smart home tech of CES 2024 and the best wearable and fitness tech from the show, but what about some of our more left-field findings? You'll find some of the best ones below, including one of the best bits if AI hardware so far, some fascinating neural headphones and a wearable oven (yes, really).\nIt hasn't all been tech eccentricities, though, because we've also found time to get eyes-on with the LG C4 OLED TV (spoiler: it'll probably be one of 2024's best TVs) and a promisingly affordable 100-inch screen from Hisense. All via a smart, eco-friendly hairdryer from Loreal, of course.\nFor a quick blast of some of the most intriguing tech of the year, read on for all of our highlights from day three of CES 2024.\n1. LG C4 OLED TV\nTransparent OLED TVs may be all the rage at CES 2024, but the ones we're actually going to buy are more like the new LG C4 OLED \u2013 and our eyes-on time with it suggests the C4 going to be one to watch (quite literally) again this year.\nLG claimed in its CES announcement that the LG C4 would be brighter than last year's LG C3, despite using the same OLED panel. We were a little dubious, but our brief time with the set (which you can read more about in our hands-on LG C4 review confirmed) confirmed that its brightness boost is indeed very real.\nCombine this with processing improvements, including the addition of\u00a0LG's lossless wireless Dolby Atmos sound, and you have a TV that we can't wait to get in for proper testing this year to see how it compares to the best OLED TVs.\n2. Rabbit R1\nSmartphones have now devoured most handheld gadgets, but a new AI-powered one is making waves at CES 2024. The Rabbit R1 is the first genuinely interesting bit of AI hardware (more so than the strange Humane AI Pin) that we've seen since the ChatGPT explosion started just over a year ago \u2013 and it might be a glimpse of next-gen voice assistants.\nWhat does the Rabbit R1 do? We'd recommend watching the R1 launch video (which was clearly influenced by the original iPhone launch) for a longer explanation, but it's essentially a tool for talking to your favorite apps using natural language. Rather than swiping between different phone apps, you create 'rabbits' that can carry out tasks \u2013 like booking a flight or doing your shopping\u00a0\u2013 using your voice commands.\nWe doubt very much that the R1 will be replacing smartphones, but it does have a point about today's archaic app-swiping experience \u2013\u00a0and it's a solid blueprint for how a next-gen Siri or Google Assistant might use AI.\n3. Amazfit Helio Ring\nWe're still waiting for the long-rumored Samsung Galaxy Ring, but in the meantime Amazfit has announced another contender for the title of best smart ring at CES 2024 called the Helio Ring.\nLike the Oura Ring, Amazfit's rival promises to serve up detailed sleep tracking and recovery stats from your workouts. You'll seemingly be able to take the Helio Ring swimming or in downpours too, as it's water-resistant to 100m. And like the best Garmin watches, it'll also give you a daily Readiness score based based on your exertions and sleep.\nWe don't yet have a price or release date for the Helio Ring yet \u2013\u00a0and you will unfortunately need a monthly subscription to unlock all of its features \u2013\u00a0but it's one we're very keen to try out later this year.\n4. Neural headphones\nRather than a single product, neural headphones are instead a fascinating new tech genre that we've seen several examples of at CES 2024. By tapping into auditory nerves, these cans can effectively read your mind, giving you hands-free control of your tech or boosting your ability to relax.\nWe checked out four examples of neural headphones at CES and all of them bring their own spin on the concept. The Naqi Neural Earbuds, for example, were developed as an alternative to brain implants, and give you control over your Windows or Mac computer. The NeurGear ZenBuds, meanwhile, stimulate your Vagus nerve to trigger a rest response.\nWith other examples like the Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband ($490, ships in February 2024) planning to help us fall and stay asleep, it's definitely a big tech trend to watch this year.\n5. Kohler Anthem Plus\nThe shower might be last place that you want to be colonized by tech, but our time with Kohler's Anthem Plus Digital Control has convinced us of the benefits of 'digital showering'.\nThis touch-sensitive controller pairs with a digital thermostatic valve to give you a gloriously multi-sensory showering experience that lets you customize the water, light, sound, and even the\u00a0steam. It isn't cheap, starting at $2,800 (around \u00a32,200 / AU$4,180), but you could probably start charging visitors for showers.\n6. Hisense 110UX ULED TV\nYou can't call it a day at CES without seeing some truly massive TVs and Hisense didn't disappoint us on day three of the show, showing us its mini-LED lineup for 2024 \u2013\u00a0include a 110in whopper.\nThe 110UX is shaping up to be an impressive set all round, despite its size, with 40,000 local dimming zones and a scorching 10,000 nits brightness. On the audio front, you also get a built-in 4.2.2-channel speaker system that's bolstered by the new Dolby Atmos FlexConnect wireless audio tech.\nBut if you've measured up and don't quite have room for a 110-inch TV, Hisense will also be launching 100-inch regular QLED model in 2024 \u2013\u00a0and if history is any guide, that model will be impressively affordable for its size.\n7. Willtex Willcook wearable oven\nOne of the phrases we didn't expect to encounter today was 'wearable oven', but CES has a habit of surprising us \u2013\u00a0and sure enough, we found ourselves on the show floor trying a backpack that can cook food.\nOkay, the Willcook isn't an oven in the traditional sense, but it does have a thin mesh fabric that its maker calls an \"embedded heat ray.\" After putting our hand inside, we can attest \u2013 this thing does get hot enough to slow-cook food (even meat, fish and curry) while you're on the move.\nThe idea is that you could cook dinner while on the way back from work or while you're on-the-go on a camping trip. We reckon the tech might have better applications in a winter coat (which was another prototype that Willtex showed us), but the wearable oven will go on sale in the US in September for around $200.\n8. Bluetooth Auracast\nIf you don't know much about Bluetooth Auracast, you can expect to hear a lot more about it in 2024. The wireless tech \u2013\u00a0which means your compatible wireless headphones aren't just limited to the devices you're paired with \u2013\u00a0is starting to roll out on everything from portable speakers like the JBL Clip 5 to Samsung's 4K TVs and earbuds.\nBut our demo showed us some practical applications that we're excited about. For example, you could be in a sports bar watching a TV that you could tune into without needing to do any pairing. Or you could be in an airport getting departure announcements beamed straight to your ears so you don't miss the last call.\nIn future, Auracast should also let you tune into two streams at once, letting you watch a TV while still getting the airport gate announcements when they're made. We'll need more devices to support it, but Auracast could change the way we use headphones.\n9. L'Oreal AirLight Pro\nHow smart can a hairdryer really get? Well, if you've been eyeing up the Dyson Supersonic, you'll definitely be interested in the Loreal AirLight Pro. It combines a bunch of impressive tech advances that make it both super-efficient and eco-friendly, and also smart enough to please your inner gadget fan.\nThat efficiency, which apparently allows the Airlight Pro to use 30% less power than a traditional hair dryer, comes from its combination of air and infrared heating elements, which make it a bit like drying your hair in the sun and wind. Impressively, it can also recognize attachments and then adjust settings based on which one you've fitted.\nNaturally, the Airlight Pro is also app-connected (for Android and iOS devices), which lets you make further tweaks and customs settings on your phone. Read our hands-on report below, which might just convince you that Loreal's hairdryer is worth the roughly $400 (about \u00a3315) that it'll cost when it goes on sale in June (in Europe) and in the US before the end of 2024.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens. Stick with us for the big stories on everything from 8K TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok for the latest from the CES show floor!\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Here Are Some of the Highlights of the Consumer Tech Show\nCES 2024, one of the biggest tech events in the world, was a star-studded event featuring innovative technology everywhere you looked. From unfolding laptops to retro phone keyboards, there were creative devices, both big and small on display. Some of the technology on display at the Consumer tech show was released immediately for purchase while others presented concept ideas that were gearing up for a launch later this year, but the one thing they all had in common was a clear vision for the future of technology. We\u2019ve already discussed some of the earlier announcements, such as the Sony XR headset and the Samsung Music Frame, but those were just the tip of the iceberg at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nA Quick Review of Some of the Most Fascinating Tech at CES 2024\nThere were an unbelievable number of products announced and presented at the Consumer Electronics 2024 Show and keeping track of all of them is not an easy task. The range of products was staggering, and while XR/AR technology has been dominating the event, we\u2019re also quite surprised at the number of home gadgets that have made an impact during the event. While Apple made its Apple Vision Pro launch announcement and temporarily distracted us from the event, we\u2019re back on track to go over some of the most interesting products that were showcased at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nWacom Cintiq Pro Tablets Announced at CES Las Vegas 2024\nWhen it comes to tech that improves your work, the Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets are a true designer\u2019s dream. The Cintiq Pro 17, 22, and 27 refer to different sized versions that are available to ensure comfort for everyone, and with their Pantone Validated and Pantone SkinTone Validated displays, they guarantee a color palette that matches up to their real-world counterparts. With a slim bezel and a large screen, the drawing tool promises a 120 Hz 4K display with a 10-point multi-touch feature that gives you the control you need to interact with your projects as you work.\nThe additional announcement of the Wacom Pro Pen 3 as well as the Cintiq Pro Stand, one that is sold separately, guarantees a fully customized experience for users who want to adapt the device to suit them instead of the other way around.\nLG Signature OLED T\u2014The World\u2019s First Transparent TV\nIt\u2019s interesting that even one company decided to bring out transparent screen technology this year but two companies with a similar idea signal the possibility of a new trend. The transparent TV has been much talked about at the CES 2024 event and while Samsung also released its own MicroLED transparent screen it wasn\u2019t as evidently a \u201cTV\u201d release as the LG edition of the product was. With a new Alpha 11 AI processor built-in, the 77-inch OLED TV comes set in the Zero Connect Box that allows you to place your TV anywhere in the room, no longer confining the device to a wall or a corner of the room.\nThe LG Signature OLED T, the world\u2019s first 4k wireless, transparent, OLED TV unveiled at #CES2024\nVideo Credit: @LGUS pic.twitter.com/J9vzu8QpAW\n\u2014 Wevolver (@WevolverApp) January 10, 2024\nModular versions of the TV allow you to pick the wall-mounted set-up as well if you still like the traditional setting. Eliminating the gaping black hole created by a generic TV, the LG Signature OLED T allows you to refine your home aesthetic to suit your tastes without compromising on your viewing experience when you do decide to use it for the purpose it was designed.\nMSI\u2019s Claw Handheld\nGamers have not been ignored this time at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event either. The Asus ROG Phone 8 catered to the world of mobile gaming while MSI\u2019s Claw handheld console. With Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake chip built into it, the deceive sets itself apart from the others on the market currently still powered by the AMD chipset. This detail, just by itself, makes the device stand out among other gaming consoles you could consider investing in this year. Promising 500 nits brightness, the 7-inch screen showcases a 1920\u00d71080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate and runs on the Intel Arc Graphics card.\nThe Valve Steam Deck remains the most affordable and popular option, all things considered, but joining the ranks of the Lenovo Legion Go or the Asus ROG Ally consoles is no easy task. And yet MSI\u2019s Claw console seems quite equipped to make a mark in the market.\nRabbit R1 Pin\u2014Creating the Simplest Computer\nThe new gadget looks just as adorable as it sounds, but its multipurpose functionality intends to join the race to replace smartphones, a challenge that we didn\u2019t know we needed to take on. The mini device aims to replace the multiple apps you have on your phone and handle tasks by itself instead, promising to book your flights and order your groceries for you. By talking to the rabbits on the device, you can assign tasks that will be taken care of for you. You can also type out the questions by shaking the device for a keyboard.\n@jessechenglyu rationale for creating Rabbit OS and their own device instead of just another app is persuasive. It resonates with Alan Kay\u2019s insight: \u2018People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\u2019 I\u2019m quite convinced getting a Rabbit R1 as my next\u2026 https://t.co/QTGcPjEJHO\n\u2014 Jaeyun Ha (@jaeyun_ha) January 12, 2024\nUnlike traditional chatbots that only understand your intention, the Rabbit R1 pin will also learn how to respond and execute them. Once you pre-authenticate the apps on the Rabbit interface on your regular computer, your Rabbit R1 device navigates through your apps based on your instructions. Now we aren\u2019t willing to let go of our phones just yet, but we\u2019re quite fascinated to see the device grow, and we\u2019re not the only ones. The first two batches of the Rabbit R1 device, each one 10,000 strong have officially sold out within days of its launch. The third batch is now open for pre-order, with an expected delivery date around May-June 2024.\nHelio Ring Debut at CES 2024\nWearable technology is definitely having its moment and the gadgets celebrated at the Consumer Tech show were no different. Amazefit\u2019s Helio Ring tracks health data just like a smartwatch would, without being as clunky or obvious with its presence. The device works like a sleep tracker but also monitors your activity on the go, reflecting all your data on the Zepp App for you to peruse when you need it. Its electrodermal activity sensors can measure your skin and sweat responses to reflect on why you might be stressed, which is interesting to the more familiar heart rate and blood-oxygen saturation trackers. The compact device is lightweight and can apparently be custom engraved with a date or phrase as well.\nSay hello to the Amazfit Helio Ring \ud83d\ude4c Engineered for elite athletes who know that quality recovery fuels peak performance, this #smartring represents a whole new level of #BreakingLimits \ud83d\udd25 Ready to recover smarter & achieve more? Check out the comments for more info \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/llgCeqKYoR\n\u2014 Amazfit (@AmazfitGlobal) January 9, 2024\nAnother honorable mention for wearable tech at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event includes the XREAL Air 2 Ultra smart glasses, which are \u201ca brand new spatial computing platform designed specifically for AR developer partners.\u201d These titanium AR glasses are going to be a much more affordable alternative for people wanting to explore the AR technology available today.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nIf your phone screens can handle being foldable why not fold your laptop screens as well? The new Asus series at CES 2024 includes the Asus Zenbook Duo which has us quite fascinated but we\u2019re equally captivated by the ZenScreen Fold OLED display. For those who require multiple monitors for their work, taking their tasks around with them becomes quite difficult. The Asus ZenScreen Fold OLED does not compromise on its display quality but also ensures that you have a portable work solution that you can set up wherever you need.\nASUS Foldable external OLED display #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/SRQtGql9UU\n\u2014 Tomi (@GadgetsBoy) January 9, 2024\nWhether in portrait or landscape mode, the screen shows no signs of interruption despite the hinge in the middle. The 17.3-inch display offers 2560\u00d71920 resolution and covers 100 percent of the cinema-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. It also has an audio jack if you choose to use the device as a screen for your gaming adventures. Samsung\u2019s Flex In and Out phone also deserves special mention for the advanced foldable tech it brought to the event among its other offerings making it evident that foldable tech might just be the way forward.\nOverall, it appears the CES Las Vegas 2024 was a big success and introduced a vast range of technology that sets the bar high for the rest of the releases this year. It\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll hear about the Consumer tech show as a lot of the products that were announced are scheduled for a release later this year. Once those begin to arrive on the market, we\u2019ll be able to see how they hold up to these initial reviews.\nFAQs\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

For example, Panasonic has incorporated joints made from high concentration cellulose fiber molding material \u201ckinari\u201d into its display tables; these tables will be used not only at CES, but at future exhibitions as well. Panasonic is also minimizing the use of building materials and carpeting.\nLive Streaming the Panasonic Press Conference\u00a0The Panasonic CES 2024 press conference (Monday, January 8, 2024, 10:00-10:45 PST) will be streamed online at https://panasonic.com/CES.\nMain Exhibits at LVCC:Panasonic Booth Overview\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas:Shiftall Booth Overview\nPanasonic CES 2024 Press Kits:https://na.panasonic.com/us/ces\nMain Exhibition Booth Highlights:The main presentation linked to the exhibition lineup will be shown in the theater at the entrance. Dioramas and representative examples will be placed in the center of each category to express Panasonic\u2019s vision for that segment.\nPanasonic GREEN IMPACTIntroduces \u201cPanasonic GREEN IMPACT,\u201d the Panasonic Group's commitment to achieving both a better life for people and a sustainable global environment. By reducing its carbon footprint, helping reduce emissions across society, and realizing a circular economy, the Group can ensure that its actions have impact.\nSustainable EnergyBy promoting the diffusion of electrification from people\u2019s homes to society, Panasonic will create a zero-CO2 society that does not require fossil fuels and that uses only renewable energy for social activities. These products and solutions will be introduced using projection mapping dioramas.\nEV Devices and SolutionsThe Panasonic Group will introduce a wide range of in-vehicle device solutions that contribute to the adoption of EVs. The exhibit will use lights and touch panels to intuitively show how Panasonic\u2019s products and technologies are used in various places throughout the car to solve environmental issues and contribute to the realization of a comfortable cabin while promoting safety and security.\nAir-to-Water Heat PumpSince Panasonic\u2019s Air-to-Water Heat Pump collects and exchanges heat from ambient air; it is an environmentally friendly heating system that can reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional combustion-type heating equipment that uses fossil fuels.\u00a0It is also possible to remotely monitor the operating status of the system, and the Group has established a system that can respond quickly in the event of a problem. Panasonic first brought its lineup to the European market in 2008, and in May 2023, became the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce products that use the environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, R290.\nGreen Hydrogen Production\u00a0Panasonic is developing high-performance electrodes for water electrolysis systems used in green hydrogen production.\u00a0These electrodes feature a high-activity catalyst material made of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH), which achieves high performance without using precious metals. Utilizing electrodes makes it possible to significantly enhance the performance of contemporary water electrolysis systems and substantially reduce the production cost of green hydrogen.\nCentral Air ConditioningThis is a concept exhibit for the central air conditioning system proposed by Panasonic.

Panasonic\u2019s future approach to consumer electronics manufacturing will be introduced through visual images.\nPlastic ReductionPanasonic is proceeding with initiatives to reduce the use of resin (plastic) based on the characteristics of individual products.\nProducts RecraftedWith the goal of contributing to the circular economy, this exhibit and video presentation will introduce the technologies that make refurbishing feasible. Applying manufacturing knowledge and expertise cultivated over many years, Panasonic has the technology to recycle used products and the knowledge to ensure quality through inspections and performance tests. In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nResource RecyclingPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product.\u201d By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource OptimizationPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nBio CO2 Crop Growth Technology\u00a0A newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nkinari\u2122 ResinDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReducing Food WasteReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELLThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nMicrowave OvensAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELLThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nEH-NA0J Hair DryerThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nMULTISHAPE Modular System and attachmentsThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nARC3 STAR WARS\u2122 Shaver\u00a0The Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper. The ES-SWLT2W includes three advanced Japanese stainless-steel blades that are designed for use on all types of beard hair to provide a close and comfortable shave, even with everyday use.\nPalm ShaverIntroducing the Palm Shaver by Panasonic: a luxurious, palm-sized shaver which redefines the shaving experience with its 70% smaller design compared to traditional shavers.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: this year's top gaming tech\nAll the best gaming announcements of CES 2024\nCES 2024 is drawing to a close, and with AI dominating everything from appliances to go karts this year's show has brought us new tech across all walks of life. We're only interested in the gadgets that are going to change your gaming setup this year, though, and with 4K QD-OLED monitors, super streamlined laptop designs, and even a new handheld to pore over there's plenty on the showfloor for gamers right now.\nWe're highlighting the absolute best of the best here, the tech we can see making a real difference for everyday gamers. Between MSI, HP, Razer, Alienware, and Asus, the top gaming brands have brought their A-game to Vegas in 2024 - but we're also looking to the worlds of projectors, TVs and even fitness for our CES 2024 digest this year.\nMSI Claw\nMSI threw a curveball at us at CES this year, a Meteor Lake run gaming handheld. While it may look like the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally (and even shares a startlingly similar screen to the latter), the MSI Claw ditches the AMD internals others have adopted in favor of Intel's Core Ultra 5 or Core Ultra 7 155H and Arc graphics. To keep all these components running smoothly, the Claw also reportedly has a higher max power draw compared to the ROG Ally at 40W. A 53WHr battery is being touted as lasting 50% longer than the market average (translating to two hours in full power mode compared to the Ally and Steam Deck's hour).\nThe brand debuted their handheld device on the CES showfloor this year, after leaked images hit the web the week before. It still managed to pack a punch, though, and Intel's place in the handheld market could be decided by this 2024 entry. Launch is expected in the first half of the year, but those crucial price numbers haven't yet been announced.\nHP Omen Transcend 32 QD-OLED gaming monitor\nSome of the best gaming monitors on the market use a QD-OLED panel to help their games shine, and CES 2024 brought a whole new crop of new devices to the showfloor. The headline this year is 4K. With Samsung and Alienware both showing off 4K 240Hz QD-OLED panels this year, it looks like the display tech has hit its ceiling for the moment - but our favorite entry was HP's Omen Transcend 32.\nThe Omen Transcend 32 packs a serious visual punch with those specs, but the brand also claims it's the first gaming monitor with switchable inputs. That KVM switch functionality means you'll be able to hook up two PCs (or, more likely, a PC and a laptop) and interact with both at the same time.\nNot only that, but it's the first OLED gaming monitor with a 140W USB-C power delivery for charging and docking to boot. Throw in an independent cooling solution, two HDMI 2.1 connections, and of course plenty of RGB and HP has come out on top this year.\nRazer Blade 16 laptop\nWe're sticking with display tech for a little while to talk about the Razer Blade 16. Razer brought Samsung into the mix for its 16-inch model this year, in efforts to debut the world's first 240Hz OLED panel on a gaming laptop at CES. The 0.2ms response time, VESA certified DisplayHDR True Black, and Calman certified 100% DCI-P3 make this an impressive display. These were all go-to specs for OLED screens just last year, but with the speed and resolution to keep up with tomorrow's games, this is the first time we're seeing an OLED panel sitting well on a high-end gaming laptop.\nThe Blade 16 also features Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs all the way up to an RTX 4090 at full 175W power, with Intel's overclockable i9-14900HX at the helm as well. Aside from that screen, then, the Blade 16 has a good shot at being one of the year's best gaming laptops all by itself. And, of course, it all comes in that classic CNC milled unibody chassis.\nAsus ROG NUC PC\nCES 2024 wasn't a massive year for the gaming PC, as evidenced by the fact that our favorite desktop from the event measures in at just 144 x 112 x 41mm. The Asus ROG NUC is a mini PC that manages to pack big components. There's an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU and Intel Core Ultra i9 processor crammed into this tiny chassis, aiming to offer desktop-level power wherever you choose to place your setup.\nThere are cheaper configurations available, with either Intel's Arc GPUs or an RTX 4060 on the shelves instead, but even these cheaper models still pack Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and 32GB DDR5 RAM. Should you wish to take it apart further down the line, Asus has also stated that it's a completely tool-less chassis for easy access when upgrade time comes.\nXGIMI Aladdin projector\nWhile they aim to make a big impact on your living room entertainment, the best projectors are the ones that can fade into the background when not in use. That's where the XGIMI Aladdin excels. The projector is cleverly disguised as a ceiling lamp (and also doubles as both lighting and a Bluetooth speaker), designed to sit atop your room.\nWith a 1080p resolution and short throw 100-inch screen capability, as well as those Harman Kardon speakers, this is a particularly well-rounded affair. On top of that you've got got a few non-traditional uses here. The Aladdin can default to displaying a series of dynamic wallpapers when not in home entertainment use, while also playing interactive children's stories or ambient sounds. The entire operation is voice activated without a remote.\nThe XGIMI Aladdin is set for release in Japan first of all, hitting the shelves in June this year. Unfortunately there's no information surrounding a worldwide release at the moment.\nLG OLED M4 TV\nLG debuted its Zero Connect Box on the OLED M3 last year, and CES brought the tech back to the showfloor with the LG OLED M4. The separate box keeps all your consoles and streaming devices plugged in, but wirelessly transmits all their signals to your TV completely removing the need for any ugly cables ruining a clean setup. That's a gift for those wall mounting their screens.\nLG pairs its industry leading OLED panel with micro lens array tech here, for a supremely crisp final picture and the full force of a new Alpha 11 processor for additional AI enhancements. The key here, though, is the bump from 120Hz to 144Hz refresh rates.\nThat, in theory, opens the LG OLED M4 up to PC play (hello Asus ROG NUC). While latencies and response times are going to factor into this experience (and won't keep up with a similarly priced gaming monitor), anyone with a stacked living room setup is going to want to see this. If everything goes to plan, this could be one of the best gaming TVs money can buy by the end of the year.\nAlienware M16 R2\nDell has redesigned its Alienware M16 machine this year and the R2 features are much longed for change. There are very few Alienware laptops that can truly be considered portable, and even the cheaper M16 range was far too bulky to realistically throw in a backpack before this year. That was largely due to a particularly wide shelf at the rear of the machine which, while providing additional cooling, extended the footprint of the whole device. That's completely gone for 2024's Alienware M16, leaving us with an almost svelt design that prioritizes quality of life over high-end performance.\nThat means the M16 R2 has had a 15% reduction in size while still offering some significant power boosts under the hood. That comes from Intel's Ultra H Series processors as well as the boosted 8TB SSD configuration option. Of course, there's a sacrifice to be made here.\nIn shrinking the M16, Dell has done away with both RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 options for its more affordable model. Instead, you've got the choice between an RTX 4050, 4060 or 4070 GPU. That's not as cut throat as it might seem, though. It opens the M16 up to a more affordable shelf slot, where players are more concerned with buying an all in one machine they can take on the go while also being able to enjoy the latest games.\nWild Card - FitXR Slam Studio\nCES wild cards can get wild. But FitXR's Slam Studio feels like it was made for the Vegas showfloor. The mixed reality system uses the Meta Quest 3 to create an interactive fitness experience was showcased for the first time at this year's event. FitXR is well established in the VR workout game, but its latest studio is the first to offer its gamified exercises in mixed reality. It's a sneaky way to meet your fitness goals while reveling in all the dopamine a high score can provide.\nIn Association with ROG Ally\nSign up to the GamesRadar+ Newsletter\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nManaging Editor of Hardware at GamesRadar+, I originally landed in hardware at our sister site TechRadar before moving over to GamesRadar.

        "raw_content": "XDA\nMonitors at CES 2024: An exciting OLED showcase and what it taught us about the year ahead in monitors\nBeautiful OLEDs and high-refresh rate panels as far as the eyes can see. Yup, that was CES 2024.\nKey Takeaways\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) never fails to deliver with its extravagant tech demos and far-out concepts that aren't going to happen anytime soon. This year was no different, with a typical tidal wave of over-the-top products, but much of what we saw at the CES 2024 show floor was exciting real tech coming into reach. Monitors were one of them, and having spent a few days reflecting on what we saw at the trade show, it's clear to me that 2024 will be an exciting year for monitors on the whole.\nWe saw many exciting monitors at CES this year, from relatively smaller and simple IPS panels to high-end OLEDs that take refresh rates to places they've never gone. The best thing about the monitors we saw at CES this year is they're all real products coming soon.\n1\n32-inch QD-OLED & WOLED 4K panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nAlienware\nAW3225QF\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nHP\nOMEN Transcend 32\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDP\n32\nOLED\n3840X2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDM\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nMSI\nMPG321URX\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 32GS95UE\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey OLED G80SD\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO32U2P\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nSamsung's QD-OLED panels are seen in huge numbers\n32-inch monitors were seen in huge numbers this year at CES 2024, and they all use either Samsung's QD-OLED or LG's upcoming WOLED panels. The Alienware AW3225QF stands out from the rest on this particular list as it's the only one sporting a curved panel with a subtle 1700R curvature. The rest of the QD-OLEDs are all fairly similar, and that list includes several options from the likes of MSI, ASUS, and more.\nHP's OMEN Transcend 32 signals the company's entry into the world of OLEDs. It uses the same Samsung QD-OLED panel currently in mass production and supports Dolby Vision HDR and HyperX-tuned audio. It features a USB-C port with 140W power, but there's no word on whether it'll come with a DisplayPort 2.1. You can turn to the Gigabyte Aorus FO32U2P for DisplayPort 2.1, as it's the only model announced so far with the official DP 2.1 support, complete with full UHBR20 bandwidth. In case you're wondering, the rest of the models support DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC) to deliver 4K 240Hz output.\nThere's also the MSI MPG321URX and the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, which use the same panel technology and are completely flat. The MPG321URX features the company's OLED Care 2.0 to prevent screen burn-in, while the Samsung Odyssey G80SD's highlight is an anti-glare coating missing from other QD-OLED monitors from CES 2024. The ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which was shown at Gamescom last year, also made an appearance at the CES 2024, and it'll be sold alongside other ROG monitors as a QD-OLED option.\nLG's WOLED panel may be worth waiting for\nSome manufacturers have opted to use LG's WOLED (White OLED) panels, which are being manufactured later this year. Like Samsung's QD-OLED, this one also measures 32 inches in size and supports a 4K resolution and up to 240Hz refresh rate. The highlight of this panel is that it also offers the ability to switch the panel to a relatively lower 1080p resolution while boosting the refresh rate to a whopping 480Hz. This is thanks to a feature that LG uses, Dynamic Frequency and Resolution (DFR), which you'll see the display manufacturers pushing as dual-mode operation.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe ASUS ROG PG32UCDP made headlines at CES this year for this dual-mode operation, which can support 4K 240Hz and FHD 480Hz outputs. LG will have an UltraGear monitor variant of its own under the model name 32GS95UE. This particular monitor uses the WOLED panel with dual-mode support. Plus, the UltraGear model will also support things like 'Pixel Sound' technology for an improved audio experience with the speakers behind the panel.\nThe Alienware AW3225QF is already available to pick up in the U.S. market, and it'll be followed by the MSI MPG321URX in February. The rest of the QD-OLED monitors showcased last week at CES don't have an official release date yet, but they'll likely end up on the shelves during Q1 2024, as the panel is already said to be in mass production. Alienware and MSI have confirmed $1,200 price tags for their monitors, so expect the rest to be priced around the same price when they arrive later this year. There's no official word on the pricing or availability of these monitors that use LG's WOLED panels. Still, we expect them to land on the market sometime in Q3, depending on when the panels enter production.\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF is one of the first 32-inch QD-OLED gaming monitors to enter the market. It sports a 32-inch panel with support for up to 4K resolution and up to a 240Hz refresh rate.\n2\n27-inch OLED screens with up to 480Hz\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nASUS\nROG Swift PG27AQDP\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n480Hz\nAlienware\nAW2725DF\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey G60SD\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO27Q3\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 27GS95QE\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n240Hz\nA more sensible option for most gamers\nWe also saw a bunch of 27-inch gaming monitors, both with QD-OLED and LG's WOLED panels at CES 2024. These monitors are solid options for those who don't want to splurge on a massive 32-inch panel for gaming. 27-inch is still a decent size for gaming monitors, and it particularly shines with 1440p resolution. A bunch of these 27-inch monitors were seen at CES, but the one that stands out the most is perhaps the ROG Swift PG27AQDP monitor. This was announced as the world's first 480Hz OLED gaming monitor, and it remains the only 27-inch option out there with such a high refresh rate on offer. Some other highlights of this particular monitor include 1300 nits of peak brightness, including a USB-C port and support for Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), essentially just a fancy marketing term for black frame insertion (BFI).\nLG has also announced the new UltraGear 27GS95QE monitor as an upgrade to its existing 27GR95QE. This updated model uses its existing WOLED panel and supports up to 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate. If you'd rather have a QD-OLED panel instead, then there's also the Dell Alienware AW2725DF. This monitor ditches LG's WOLED in favor of Samsung's QD-OLED. It tops out at 360Hz but is already available in the US market.\nThe Alienware AW2725DF is an excellent gaming monitor that supports QHD resolution and up to 360Hz refresh rate. It sports a 27-inch panel that supports Adaptive FreeSync and has VESA AdaptiveSync Display certification.\nMSI MPG27QRX is also a good option if you're looking at a 27-inch QD-OLED monitor for your setup. This MSI monitor uses the same panel as the Alienware AW2725DF but comes with a USB-Type-C with 90W output and MSI's Panel Care 2.0 feature set like its 32-inch siblings. Gigabyte's Aorus FO27Q3 is also a good option to look forward to if you are in the market for a high refresh-rate gaming monitor. It remains to be seen whether it'll get the same features and specifications as its 4K sibling, though. Samsung's Odyssey G60SD stands out a bit in the 27-inch lineup due to its added matte AG coating. The G60SD is a bit thin on the feature set compared to its 32-inch QD-OLED sibling, but you still get a solid screen for gaming.\nNone of the 27-inch monitors, except the Alienware AW2725DF, have an official release date or the associated pricing information just yet. Most of them will start shipping within the next few months, but the ROG monitor with LG's WOLED will arrive later this year.\n3\nLarge format Ultrawide monitors\nNew models with existing OLED panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nCurvature\nAcer\nPredator X34\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator X39\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator Z57\n57\nVA with Mini LED\n7680x2160\n120Hz\n1000R\nAcer\nPredator X34 V3\n34\nVA panel\n3440x1440\n180Hz\n1500R\nLG\nUltraGear 34GS95QE\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 39GS95QE\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 45GS95QE\n45\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG34WCDM\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG39WCDM\n39\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nGigabyte\nAorus MO34WQC2\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nSamsung\nOdyssey G95SD\n49\nQD-OLED\n5120x1440\n240Hz\n1800R\nDell\nUltrasharp U4025QW\n40\nIPS LCD\n5120x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nDell\nUltrasharp U3425WE\n34\nIPS LCD\n3440x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nThere were no major breakthroughs in the ultrawide monitor space, as almost all new monitors announced at CES 2024 are simple upgrades to the existing options that are out there. We'll see a bunch of new ultrawide monitors over the next couple of months on the market from the likes of Acer, LG, and Samsung, but it's worth highlighting that pretty much all of them use the same WOLED or QD-OLED panels on the existing monitors.\nThey're essentially just updated models of the existing monitors out there, so you'll see Odyssey G95SD as an upgrade to the existing Odyssey G95SC, the new UltraGear 45GS95QE, and more. The added features vary based on the monitor you pick up, but they largely include things like an added USB-C port, support for features like KVM, higher brightness, and more. We also spotted a few LCD ultrawide monitors at CES, some of which use a VA panel while others have an IPS LCD. You can expect to see most of these monitors in Q1 2024,\n4\nMonitors with G-Sync Pulsar coming later this year\nNvidia announced the new G-Sync Pulsar technology alongside its Super GPUs at CES. This technology allows you to use their ultra-low motion blur (ULMB) at the same time as the G-Sync variable refresh rate for smooth visuals. We've seen manufacturers like ASUS using this particular technology with ELMB, which has already been announced for ROG Swift models. Nvidia details its technology as a superior option to the existing solution in its blog post. It has implemented an algorithm that dynamically adjusts strobing patterns to varying render rates.\nSimply put, Nvidia is claiming a technology that ensures perfect sync between Adaptive Overdrive and backlight pulse with the screen's refresh cycle. Its technology, however, requires the use of a new type of panel, meaning it won't be made available to existing G-Sync monitor users via an update. You can only expect new G-Sync Pulsar-supported monitors to arrive later in the year, and we expect to learn more about them in the coming months.\nA massive year for OLED monitors\nLooking at all the OLED monitors dazzling at CES, it's safe to say that the gaming industry is gearing up for a significant shift to OLEDs. It's truly an exciting time to be in the market for a high-end gaming monitor, as we'll continue to see new monitors roll out on the market in the coming months. Even those who may not be tempted to pick one up right now will eventually end up with one of these as the prices go down and the technology improves. In the meantime, you can continue taking advantage of the monitors in the budget space, which is also expected to see better options throughout the year.\nXDA Newsletter\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nAn evergreen writer at XDA Developers serving up reviews, buying guides, deals, and more on laptops, PC hardware, and smartphones that you care about.

It pushes the art of the TV set to a new level, combining developments from LG\u2019s ground-breaking rollable TV with its unique wireless 4K HDR 120Hz streaming tech and, of course, a clear 4K OLED panel \u2013 all built into a piece of furniture that makes it a real lifestyle object.\nIt can show partially transparent video, or you can watch it like a normal TV with the full contrast you expect from OLED thanks to a contrast-boosting layer that automatically rises out of the base \u2013 plus there's powerful built-in sound, and no cable clutter thanks to the cutting-edge wireless connection box. It all adds up into something unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before in the best TVs.\nBest projector: Samsung The Premiere 8K\nSamsung\u2019s flagship projector for 2024, The Premiere 8K, is the world\u2019s first to support wireless 8K streaming, something it does using an included One Connect box with Wi-Fi 7 support (picture on the right in the image above). It can beam a 150-inch 8K image when positioned just 12 inches away from a screen, and its brightness is specified at an impressive 4,000 lumens, putting it in good company among the best projectors.\nThe Premiere 8K is also an all-in-one solution for home theater audio and gaming. It has a built-in 8.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system powered by 100 watts, and uses Sound-on-Screen tech to elevate audio from the projector up to the screen area for a more cinematic presentation. Like other Samsung projectors, it features the same smart TV interface found in the company\u2019s TVs for streaming, along with Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming. It's high-end tech in a very lifestyle-friendly package and design, and we're excited to see more of it.\nBest soundbar: Samsung HW-Q990D\nThe HW-Q990D is the successor to Samsung\u2019s HW-Q990C, which was already the best soundbar for anyone who wants easy but truly powerful and engrossing Dolby Atmos sound. With 22 speaker drivers and 11.1.4 channels, it\u2019s a go-to option for complete Dolby Atmos immersion, and this year Samsung has added 4K 120Hz pass-through to its HDMI ports, fixing the only minor flaw that we found with its predecessor.\nWhen paired with a compatible Samsung TV, the Q990C can receive Dolby Atmos signals wirelessly. It also supports Samsung\u2019s new Active Voice Pro feature, which uses AI to dynamically highlight voices in a movie\u2019s audio mix and elevate them for those movies where you struggle to hear what's going on. Which will be especially welcome when the soundtrack is as powerful and hard-hitting as this soundbar is capable of being, from our time with it on the show floor.\nBest speaker: Brane X\nSometimes at CES, you know the instant you try a product that you\u2019re seeing something that changes your expectations for a type of product. The Brane X is that for the best wireless speakers. It\u2019s a portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker that has a real, bona fide subwoofer in there. Not a bass port, not a woofer \u2013 a subwoofer that\u2019s the equivalent of an eight-inch sub like you'd find in a soundbar\u2019s separate subwoofer unit. You can see the air vents for it on the right side of the picture above \u2013 it covers the whole bottom of the unit.\nThe difference is absolutely astounding; powerful bass in music that you can feel in your diaphragm for tracks that load up on it, or just a much fuller and richer sound to acoustic instruments that covers a broader, and so more realistic, audio range \u2013 all from something the size of a six-pack. It uses a unique subwoofer design to make this happen, and combined with four other drivers, you get the best, most fulsome sound I\u2019ve heard from any speaker that isn\u2019t a floorstander. It\u2019s launching imminently in the US for $599, and music fans with limited space absolutely must take notice. Not that you\u2019d be able to avoid noticing one if it were playing in front of you.\nBest headphones: Sennheiser Momentum 4 True Wireless\nSennheiser has jumped on the latest generations of Bluetooth tech with its latest wireless earbuds, adding Qualcomm's new chip with Snapdragon Sound for CD-quality audio if you have a compatible phone, but they're also ready for the future of regular Bluetooth with support for Bluetooth 5.4 and LE Audio and Auracast.\nMost importantly, as you'd expect from Sennheiser, we've found they deliver superb audio quality and strong adaptive noise cancellation from what we could tell in our time with them, and still with a long battery life of 7.5 hours in the buds (though we couldn't test that yet). Sennheiser says they're also very low-latency, so will be a step up for gamers.\nWe like the design too, with a shiny finish that nods at jewelry, and a fabric case that follows Sennheiser's other designs. It seems clear that we have a big contender for our list of the best wireless earbuds here.\nBest music player: Fiio R9\nThis all-in-one music system for the streaming world is the ultimate hub however you like to listen, and a great-looking object to have in your home to boot. Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. But in a nice touch, if you don\u2019t want to sign up to Google, Fiio has added its own app store with major music services on board, no login required.\nThe box can handle basically any kind of digital file you could want to throw at it, from PCM 768kHz/32-Bit to DSD512 to MQA, and it even has two kinds of HDMI connection (ARC and straight audio, for SACD/DVD-Audio fans) and it sounds absolutely fantastic. We listened with Fiio\u2019s new FT5 planar magnetic headphones, and there\u2019s so much power and poise and dynamic range, all in a sleek metal design with light-up dials. For those who want the feeling of a huge music system and library in a compact space, this is irresistible.\nBest laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE\nLenovo has been experimenting with E-Ink laptop covers for a few years now, and the Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE concept laptop seems like the natural evolution of its work to date. Even more though, it feels like we can finally see the point of having an E-Ink cover at all.\nThe E-Ink Prism technology built into the lid of the laptop enables you to create a color design on your laptop lid that isn\u2019t just a picture, but can feature animation that brings unparalleled personalization to your device in a way a simple sticker or case on the best laptops never could.\nIt\u2019s not as simple as uploading a PNG, however. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. For the rest of us, we can still absolutely make the device our own \u2013 Lenovo's breathed new life into laptop design with this version of the tech.\nBest computing component: AMD Ryzen 8040 Series\nThe Ryzen 8040-series CPUs that AMD announced at CES 2024 are more than just Team Red\u2019s answer to Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake mobile processors, if AMD\u2019s published benchmarks are right, it might be the AI chip to have in the best laptops next year, such as the new Razer Blade 14 pictured above, which includes the new platform.\nAccording to AMD, the new Ryzen 8040 series processors aren\u2019t just competitive with Intel\u2019s newest mobile silicon, they outpace them across a wide array of workloads from gaming to the latest generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.\nOf course, AMD is going to cherry pick its best results if it can, but if its numbers are accurate, these mobile processors can go a long way to eating into Intel\u2019s absolutely dominant position in the mobile laptop market, and give people a real reason to switch over from Team Blue.\nBest gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\nMSI has a long pedigree for gaming hardware, and its new device is a stunning handheld in its own right. The 1080p display is incredibly crisp thanks to its wide color coverage and speedy refresh rate, while the 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and up to 1TB NVMe SSD storage will help make managing your game library on the go a lot less painful. We were impressed with the whole device in our MSI Claw hands-on, and we can't wait to get deeper into using it.\nBest computing accessory: Razer Project Esther\nRazer Project Esther is the iconic peripherals brand\u2019s latest take on a fairly old and often repetitive gaming technology that has always offered the promise of deeper immersion, but never really truly gotten there. While there are seams in the Project Esther\u2019s Sensa HD Haptic technology, they are extremely tight, and the overall experience this chair cushion provides is difficult-to-describe (though I certainly tried in a hands-on preview of Project Esther earlier this week).\nThe long and short of what makes this cushion so different is that while many haptic products promise more immersive gaming, Project Esther comes way closer to what most people are hoping for than any competing product on the market thanks to its directional HD haptics. The closest analogue to this would be Dolby Atmos, but for haptics \u2013 and with a software development kit for game developers to fine-tune the haptic experience of their games, this device is one of the few products of this kind that gamers are really going to want if it goes on-sale.\nBest mobile accessory: Clicks Keyboard\nThe question isn't whether you need Clicks, the premium new keyboard that attaches to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro. The question is why aren't there more keyboards for smartphones already? If you write a lot of messages, or even if you just write captions for your favorite photos and videos, Clicks gives you a smart new way to type that frees up a ton of screen space.\nIt's pricey at $139, but it feels like a premium keyboard for your Pro-level iPhone. It's got a backlight, and it comes in a staid London Blue or smiley-faced Bumblebee yellow that will attract glances from curious keyboard newbs and old school BlackBerry fans alike. We've never done more writing on our phones, and Clicks strongly makes the case that physical keys are due a comeback.\nBest smart home innovation: Nanoleaf Orchestrator\nNanoleaf's Orchestrator software is a massive improvement upon the smart lighting company's existing Rhythm tool, taking music visualization to new heights. Not only does it interpret the beat and melodies into color palettes and motions (and allow for personalization, too), but you can even group your devices into different parts of the tracks, too.\nWhere Rhythm uses on-device built-in microphones to detect sound, Orchestrator picks apart music played through your laptop or PC, identifying the mood and layers of a track to create a gorgeous complimentary light show. The only software we've tried that comes close is Philips Hue's, but that's exclusive to Spotify and way less customizable.\nAs of writing, it's only available on the Nanoleaf Desktop App, but we'd be very surprised if a mobile equivalent didn't roll out within the next year or two. The fun this can add to your smart lighting setup can't be underestimated\nBest small appliance: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nWhile the robot vacuum and mop part of this product itself isn't brand new at CES, having released late last year, this new edition of the Deebot X2 is pretty special and novel; it features a connected handheld vacuum (or one with a handle), which also auto-empties itself into the same vacuum bag as the robot vacuum when you dock it. The space-saving potential is excellent, but more than that, the vacuum is pretty accomplished, too.\nThe Deebot X2 robot vacuum is square-shaped, optimized for better wall-to-wall and corner cleaning, and sporting a gorgeous, minimalist design. Plus, thanks to the Matter 1.2 rollout, the bot is now Matter-compatible, though it also supports Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri Shortcuts natively, as well as its own Yiko 2.0 voice control.\nIt's just a great pairing that brings a feature that's been a recent and extremely convenient feature of the best robot vacuums (the self-emptying tool) to the world of the best cordless vacuums. When you've finished, you just pop it back to charge and you don't need to think about the dust. We love it.\nBest wellness tech: Baracoda BMind\nThe BMind smart mirror is a glimpse into the bathrooms of the future. Powered by generative AI and Natural Language Processing, it offers personalized recommendations based on the user's mental state, all controlled by a combination of gesture and voice commands. It can do things like detect that you look sad, and ask you how your day is going, and make changes based on your response.\nFor example, you can say that you're feeling sad or down, and it will use light therapy techniques, changing its LED light output in a way that can help to improve your mood. It also has mindfulness exercises such as guided meditation built in that it can suggest and run too \u2013 all provided through the CareOS interface and programs from ThrivePal. Its built-in camera has face detection so everything is personalized for you (and kept only to you).\nIt can also help in more physical ways, with guided toothbrushing coaching, and skin analysis, so it can make recommendations for how to, say, reduce redness in your face. If it works as well as BMind says, it could be a much more convenient way to get help and advice than by reaching for your phone and it'll be more personalized.\nBest wearable: Evie Smart Ring\nNot only is Evie a rare gem among health devices at CES, in that it will actually launch, but it's also a wearable device that puts women first in all the best ways.\nFrom its gorgeous, open design that accommodates the natural fluctuations in a woman's body over the course of the month, to its intelligent application and AI insights engine, Evie's all about putting women's health center-stage in an industry where it's often an afterthought.\nBest of all, it's completely subscription free, meaning you can enjoy its medical-grade sleep, blood oxygen, heart health detection and menstrual data insights without worrying about the on-going cost. This looks like a great rival to the best smart rings.\nBest health tech: Withings BeamO\nThe idea of a do-it-all, handheld medical diagnostic devices is not new; fans of Star Trek well remember Dr. McCoy\u2019s Tricorder. Withings' BeamO is not quite that, but may be an exciting baby step in the right direction. It\u2019s a lightweight, compact, all-in-one device that can run ECG, blood oxygen, temperature and even stethoscope tests.\nYou don\u2019t wave BeamO in front of a body to detect trouble. Instead, you\u2019ll place BeamO against your temple or chest (or hold the sensors on it for SPO2 and ECG readings). The exciting thing is that whatever data it collects can instantly be shared with your healthcare professional who will know how to read your health stats.\nBest outdoor tech: Swarovski Ax Visio\nHigh-end binoculars with a digital camera built-in so that you can capture what you're looking at are nothing new. High-end binoculars with a digital camera and AI recognition software that can tell you what you're looking at? That's new, and extremely cool. The neural processing unit in these binoculars is similar to what you get in the latest phones, and has been trained to identify 9,000 species of birds, so you no longer need to refer to a book or call your twitching uncle to discover what was hanging out on that cliff.\nSimply take a look through them like any other binoculars to find something interesting, and when you see a mystery bird, press a button on the side that will show a red circle in your vision. Get your bird into this circle, and its name will appear underneath. It's the ideal use of this kind of technology, and a perfectly futuristic upgrade to the most old-school of products.\nBest yard tech: Weber Summit Grill\nWeber makes some of the most effective grills and smokers you can buy, and now the company is offering one of the most advanced with the Weber Summit Smart Grill. This is for aspiring or accomplished chefs, as the featureset could cater a serious party. Besides the six burners, the infrared element up top, and the rotisserie spit, you get a digital PID controller that truly represents the next generation of grilling. It monitors everything, from the flame activity to the temperature to the gas levels, and gives you helpful feedback where to place your food for the best direct and indirect heat cooking.\nThe Weber Summit grill includes remarkable safety features that check the fire constantly, and even though it looks like a fancy computer, it can handle the same extreme heat and cold weather that you'd expect from any Weber grill, so it's not more delicate just because it's smarter. This will turn anyone in a true grilling pro.\nBest science tech: Celestron Origin\nAmateur astronomers dream of powerful telescopes and long warm nights of star gazing. The reality is the best time for star gazing is in the winter, and most telescopes are exercises in frustration. Smart telescopes bridge the gap between our stargazing wishes and the ability to carry them out, and Celestron Origin takes the concept to the next level.\nIt does all the hard work of finding celestial bodies, and will let you schedule when you want it to find and capture imagery of the planets, stars, and galaxies. Better yet, you can do it all from the warmth and comfort of your living room couch, using an iPad or your Phone. Want to see what it captured? It\u2019ll show up on your screen and you can cast it to your living room TV. This is the kind of armchair astronomy we can get behind.\nBest car tech: BMW Augmented Reality Ride Concept\nYou wouldn\u2019t think augmented reality and driving would go perfect together, and yet BMW showed me how wearing Xreal Air 2 glasses inside a beautiful EV BMW would somehow feel natural and even useful. The concept is simple: Xreal\u2019s glasses integrate with your phone, which is connected to the car to deliver real-time AR imagery that can tell you things about your trip that you might otherwise miss or have to glance down at a screen to see. Think direction, hazards, and indications that you\u2019re veering into the other lane, and you get the idea. The concept even extends to your passengers, who could, with their own glasses, turn any car surface into a screen for bingeing on the road.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "All the gaming news you should (and shouldn\u2019t) expect from CES 2024\nFor most people, the first few weeks of January are a slow time where everyone\u2019s easing back into their lives after long holiday breaks. That\u2019s far from the case for the tech industry. CES kicks off next week, bringing an exciting few days filled with innovative new tech products. Historically, that\u2019s brought us everything from flashy monitors to smart mattress toppers (yes, that was a very real product at last year\u2019s show).\nFor video game enthusiasts, CES can either be a huge deal or so insignificant that one may not even know it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s an important showcase for PC gamers specifically, as it\u2019s filled with advanced computing tech that often comes with major gaming benefits. For those who stick to consoles, though, it\u2019s a bit less exciting these days. The show\u2019s shrinking scope over the past few years has seen a smaller focus on gaming, with only a handful of console accessories slipping into the Las Vegas exhibition. Still, every year brings at least one major announcement that\u2019s sure to make headlines.\nSo, should you be paying attention to CES this year if you\u2019re eager for gaming news? If last year\u2019s show is anything to judge by, the answer is yes \u2014 but come in with some very low expectations.\nGaming at CES 2024\nWhen I put together a CES preview like this, I\u2019d usually spend most of the time walking through some teases and rumors. This year, I don\u2019t have much to go on. We\u2019ve yet to hear much from major video game brands like PlayStation and Xbox about what may be coming at the show. The information we do have in advance is sparse. We know that Mad Catz will bring its latest third-party video game accessories, alongside a demo for the upcoming Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward.\nOther than that, CES will bring the usual suspects when it comes to gaming-adjacent tech. LG is expected to show off its 4K OLED UltraGear monitor this year and AMD has some new graphics cards in the works. You can expect a lot of computing news along those lines, with devices like gaming laptops being a central part of the multiday event.\nThat\u2019s not to say that there won\u2019t be anything juicier at the show for gaming fans; it\u2019s just that CES has become far less predictable for that industry in recent years. Previous events would bring out tons of third-party controllers, arcade cabinets, and conceptual devices like Alienware\u2019s home server, Nyx. We can expect that Razer will come with some sort of left-field idea of its own, just as it did with last year with Project Carol.\nIf any major gaming news is going to come from the show, it\u2019ll be via Sony. The hardware giant has fully embraced CES as a space to reveal PlayStation products over the last few years, making its press conference a must-watch. Previously, we\u2019ve seen both the PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation Access Controller at the show. We\u2019ve even gotten video game sizzle reels that have confirmed release date delays. There\u2019s a good chance Sony will continue that trend this year, as it\u2019s confirmed to be hosting a show.\nThe long-shot hope would be that Sony will use the stage to show off an upgraded PlayStation 5 Pro model this year. While not impossible, it would be an uncharacteristically big reveal for Sony. That\u2019s not to mention that the company just launched its new, slimmer PS5 models, so it might be a bit early to show off another hardware upgrade. The more realistic guess is that it could reveal some new headphones or devices compatible with its new PlayStation Link technology.\nThere is one exciting X-factor this year \u2014 and, fittingly, it\u2019s Xbox. Generally, Microsoft doesn\u2019t use the show to talk about its new gaming hardware, despite the fact that it revealed the original Xbox there at CES 2001 (with the help of The Rock). Instead, it tends to tout the work of its \u201cpartners\u201d via Windows-enabled devices. However, we do know that there\u2019s a lot of new Xbox hardware brewing thanks to documents leaked during Microsoft\u2019s battle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over its Activision Blizzard acquisition. A new Xbox controller with improved haptics and a refreshed Xbox Series X model are both in the cards for the brand. While unlikely, it\u2019s not impossible that Microsoft could time an announcement for one of those products during the show.\nThe only other gaming news you\u2019ll want to keep your eye on pertains to the portable PC market. Last year was a major year for Steam Deck-style devices thanks to the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go. That seemed to tease the beginning of a hot new trend that other hardware manufacturers are likely to follow. We know that Alienware previously had a concept for a device like that kicking around, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a company like Acer taking its own stab at the market. Nothing\u2019s confirmed at the moment, but considering that last year\u2019s show gave us the Razer Edge, it\u2019s not entirely out of the question.\nNo matter what happens, gaming\u2019s presence will be an important component of CES 2024. If we get a few headline-making reveals, it\u2019ll establish the tech expo as one of the key spots for hardware reveals. If not much comes of it at all, it\u2019ll be a sign that gaming companies might be ready to move on from CES in the same way the industry abandoned E3. Considering that the latter is now retired due to a lack of interest from the big players, that\u2019s one power vacuum CES won\u2019t want to leave unfilled.\nWhen I first heard about the Steam Deck, my brain went big. I started imagining all the giant AAA games I\u2019d be able to play on the go once I had a portable computer. When I got my unit, I immediately downloaded Elden Ring\u00a0and fired up my save file. That\u2019s something my Nintendo Switch couldn\u2019t do.\nWhile it\u2019s been thrilling to fire up PS4-quality games on the subway, those aren\u2019t the titles I\u2019ve been playing the most on my Steam Deck. Instead, my go-to game has been comparatively modest. For me, the early access indie hit Vampire Survivors is the closest thing the system has to a killer app, showcasing the true utility of the Steam Deck.\nGetting access\nVampire Survivors is a simple game. The gothic 8-bit game merely asks players to survive a constant wave of enemies for 30 minutes. They\u2019ll start with a basic weapon that auto-attacks and gain more abilities every time they level up. Players move around to dodge enemies, but otherwise, they\u2019re simply building the perfect monster-slaying machine. At the start of a run, players are slowly slashing a few enemies with a whip. By the end, the screen is filled with magic spells and enemies, pushing the frame rate to its limits.\nCES is chock-full of new product announcements every year, but unfortunately, most of them are just that: Announcements. Tech companies come out, loudly proclaim that their latest gadget will transform your life, and then quietly mutter that it won't actually be available until some yet-t0-be-determined point in the next year. As such, most of what we see at CES in a given year ends up being annoyingly unattainable.\nBut thankfully, not everyone at CES shows up with a booth full of flashy promises. A rare few of them come to the show with products that are ready to ship right away, immediately after they're revealed. So as a tip of our hat to those thoughtful few who go the extra mile to provide us the instant gratification we crave, we've rounded up all the best CES gear that you can buy right now. Everything on this list will ship before the end of January, if not sooner. Enjoy!\nTCL's gargantuan, 95-inch 4K QLED TV\nEveryone loves an underdog story. The tale of someone picking themselves up, facing down adversity, and overcoming the odds is one we as a society never seem to get tired of for how inspirational they can be. For video games, redemption arcs have been a bit more complicated.\nOn one hand, there are some titles that have managed to turn their fate around. These are games where developers didn't give up after a bad launch, making good on their promises to keep on improving the title until it is what it really always should have been. On the other hand, those game redemption arcs can take years to come to fruition. Heading into 2022, the gaming landscape is no longer a sustainable place for those long-tail success stories.\nThe redeemed\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "The best gaming laptops we saw at CES 2024\nCES is always flooded with new gaming laptops, but this year felt a bit different. Like the best laptops of CES as a whole, the updates to gaming laptops this year focused more on improved displays and new designs than just updated internals.\nHere are the four gaming laptops I saw this year that really got me excited to spend more time with them.\nROG Zephyrus G14\nThe Zephyrus G14 has always been one of our favorite gaming laptops. It was a laptop that perfectly balanced portability and performance \u2014 one that could function as well for gaming as it could for work. But this year, Asus redesigned the entire chassis of this device, bringing an eye-catching new lid, a thinned-out profile, a silver color, and a larger touchpad that extends to the full stretch of the palm rests.\nAs you may notice, a lot of those features aren\u2019t gaming-focused. And that\u2019s because this redesign of the ROG Zephyrus G14 seems to be targeting more of a crossover demographic. It\u2019s a spot the Razer Blade 14 has owned over the years, but increasingly, the G14 seems like a serious contender. Throw in a killer-looking OLED display and the latest Ryzen processors, and this one looks like it\u2019ll be tough to beat.\nHP Omen 14 Transcend\nHP\u2019s Omen has been rather quiet over the past few years, especially on the gaming laptop front. The new Omen 14 Transcend feels like a pretty compelling fresh start for the brand \u2014 combined with its new QD-OLED monitor. When announced, it\u2019s calling card was its claim as the \u201clightest 14-inch gaming laptop\u201d with a weight of just 3.6 pounds. The aforementioned ROG Zephyrus G14 has since stolen that title at 3.4 pounds \u2014 but the Omen 14 Transcend is nevertheless quite a thin and light gaming laptop.\nThe Omen 14 Transcend comes in a new white color, which is all the rage these days. It also comes with ports placed in the rear and an all-around clean look.\nMSI Titan 18 HX\nMSI Titan gaming laptops have never been for the faint of heart. They\u2019re big, expensive, and supremely powerful. MSI brought an update to the Titan 18 HX to CES this year, which boasts one major new feature: an 18-inch 4K 120Hz mini-LED screen. It\u2019s the first of its kind, hitting 1,000 nits of brightness, which should make for some really solid HDR performance. Even though many gamers may prefer a slightly lower resolution with a higher refresh rate, the Titan 18 HX is definitely pushing the envelope, especially since high refresh rate 18-inch OLED panels don\u2019t seem to be available right now.\nBeyond that, the MSI Titan HX also comes with a light-up, seamless haptic touchpad \u2014 another feature we haven\u2019t seen on gaming laptops.\nAlienware m17 R2\nThe Alienware m17 R2 represents a pretty drastic redesign of the line, as it has ditched the thermal shelf on the back that has defined the look of every other Alienware laptop. That reduces the footprint on the table quite a bit, and required the company to completely redesign the internals of the laptop as well. We\u2019ll have to wait to review the laptop ourselves, but Dell is claiming that airflow is significantly better this time around, despite the new design.\nOverall, Alienware wants this to be the company\u2019s more subtle choice in the lineup. To that end, it scaled back some of the exaggerated vents and angular lines. There\u2019s even a dedicated \u201cstealth mode\u201d key to quickly turn off the lights and fans. It\u2019s no ROG G14 or Razer Blade in terms of a more minimalist gaming laptop \u2014 but for Alienware, this is certainly a more toned-down look.\nI'm worried about Nvidia's upcoming RTX 4080 Super, but probably not for the reason you think. Nvidia revealed the long-rumored GPU at CES 2024, and perhaps the most shocking news around the announcement was that Nvidia was going to drop the price. Instead of releasing at the same $1,200 list price as the original RTX 4080, the RTX 4080 Super is launching at $1,000.\nIt's a great price, and a positive step for Nvidia, which has largely been seen as the driving force behind high GPU prices over the past year. I'm worried the price might be too good, though.\nMSI is entering the handheld arena, and its debut is more significant than you might think. The MSI Claw doesn't look dissimilar from the Asus ROG Ally or even the Steam Deck OLED, but the specs underneath mark a significant departure for handheld gaming PCs.\nI had a chance to try the device at CES 2024, and it's definitely a contender. Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\nWell, I didn't see that one coming.\nAsus may have brought the first true 480Hz OLED gaming monitor to CES 2024. The ROG Swift PG27AQDP is a 1440p resolution OLED monitor that comes with a staggering 480Hz refresh rate -- that alone tells you what you need to know about this beast.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
