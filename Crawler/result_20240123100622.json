        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Display Technology\nA Brilliant Driver, Macroblock was on the Road to CES 2023\nMacroblock participated in Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023 held in Las Vegas, USA for the first time. The exhibits include LED headlights, LED rear lights, and FALD (Full Array Local Dimming) LED backlight modules of the in-vehicle display. The highlights will be explained one by one below.\nJan. 16, 2023\nMacroblock, which is actively developing in new fields, has recentlybegun to harvest in the automotive market, and major international manufacturers have successively adopted Macroblock's LED automotive driver ICs. In order to enhance brand visibility, Macroblock participated in Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023 held in Las Vegas, USA for the first time. The exhibits include LED headlights, LED rear lights, and FALD (Full Array Local Dimming) LED backlight modules of the in-vehicle display. The highlights will be explained one by one below.\nThe booth demonstrated automotive lights and backlight display modules with Macroblock LED driver ICs, including new types of automotive lights currently under development.\nHeadlights: Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB)\nAt present, high-end car manufacturers have launched car models with adaptive driving beam by arranging multiple LEDs into matrix-shaped headlights. Each LED can be lit individually. With lens modules, comprehensive consideration of environmental information, geographical location and even driving speed, the angle of the high beam or low beam is changed accordingly to improve driving safety. The more LEDs, the more flexibility to adjust illumination zones. The adaptive capabilities improve visibility to reveal critical objects such as pedestrians, oncoming vehicles, and traffic signs while avoiding dazzling other drivers.\nMacroblock demonstrates the ADB system by using 100 LEDs and LED driver ICs MBI6353Q. Features of the driver IC are: 1) Flexible current design 2) 4,096 steps of brightness adjustment to fit ambient light change 3) Meet automotive safety integrity level ASIL B.\nRear Light: Full-width Rear light\nIn recent years, automakers have successively introduced LEDs into the application of rear lights. What they are looking for is high-tech and exquisite outline that LEDs bring. Auto manufacturers design rear lights or the third central brake lights in a strip or narrow shape, forming a full-width rear light. The visual extension is achieved by increasing the illuminated area, and cars are easier to identify when lit up at night. A higher-end design is capable of independent control of LEDs, and the welcome light effect of the rear light can be programmed variously.\nThe exhibit is a built-in LED driver IC MBI5353Qthat meets the automotive safety integrity level ASIL A, and the pitch of the module is 0.9375mm. The feature of independent control of LEDs is used for a rear trunk LED multi-function stripe to create more lighting effects and present a variety of appearance designs.\nFALD (Full Array Local Dimming) LED Backlight Modules of In-vehicle Display\nTwo FALD LED Backlight modules were exhibited in the booth, including 1) The backlight module for a mini-LED interactive safe driving display, which has been adopted in mass-produced cars. The display is embedded in the steering wheel to provide the driver with driving information. The backlight module is built in Macroblock LED driver IC MBI5353Q that meets the automotive safety integrity level ASIL A, providing 16-bit grayscale, and only one driver IC can control local dimming zones up to 1,536, which not only brings fine images to a small-sized display but also due to the high-brightness feature of LEDs make it possible to watch displays in bright sunlightwithout disturbance. 2) The curved local dimming backlight module is built in LED driver IC MBI6353Q, and its hybrid dimming technology can generate excellent low-grayscale images, and the environmental information can still be clearly captured even in dim light. In addition, Macroblock's LED backlight driver ICs can provide automakers with flexible function design options for expanding application functions or simplifying circuit design.\nMacroblock, which is gradually blooming in the automotive field, is based on the entrepreneurial spirit of constantly exploring the market. Expanding into the automotive market, Macroblock has accumulated a solid foundation in its automotive LED driver ICs certified by ACE-Q100 and ASIL A/B, and will continue to develop advanced products to tap into new opportunities in the future.\nRELATED CONTENT\nKEEP UP WITH WHAT\u2019S NEW IN THE DIGITAL SIGNAGE INDUSTRY\nSign up now for the Digital Signage Today newsletter and get the top stories delivered straight to your inbox.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\nDisplay Technology\nAlfalite introduces AlfaArt luxury LED\nAVI-SPL Dallas showroom fuses legrand, Nanolumens, Chief solutions for dvLED display\nColorful debuts NVIDIA RTX 40 SUPER Series Graphics Cards\nHow to Develop Digital Signage Content for Trade Shows\nTOP STORIES\nInteractive Customer Experience (ICX) Summit\nSeptember 9-11, 2024 | Charlotte, NC\nNews\nResources\nTop Picks\nTrending\nPremium Content\nAlready a member?

It has continued to invest in the existing LED display market and continuously competed in new fields; \u201cElectric Vehicles/ Intelligent Cockpits\u201d, the automotive applications, is one of them. Macroblock are showcasing several LED driver ICs for current or upcoming automotive lighting or automotive displays at Touch Taiwan 2023.Automotive Lighting Demonstration:\u00a0Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB)The \u201csoftware-defined vehicles\u201d concept became increasingly prevalent in the automotive industry. Designing electric vehicles/ intelligent cockpits is as flexible as developing software, and vehicles will be smarter and more autonomous. The adaptive driving beam (ADB) is an example. Vehicles automatically adjust irradiation angles and irradiation areas of \u200b\u200bthe high beam and low beam after considering the speed and surrounding environment. Without affecting driving visibility, vehicles with ADB can avoid strong light interference to oncoming vehicles and vehicles in front, and can specially illuminate important objects on the road, such as pedestrians, animals, road signs, etc.Macroblock exhibits an adaptive driving beam using LED driver IC MBI6353Q at the booth. MBI6353Q has 48 channels and supports 4-scan design. It can control 192 LED zones in time-multiplexing technology. With 100mA maximum current and 24V voltage, it enables tremendous design flexibility. It can increase brightness by driving multiple LEDs in cascade. It can also drive the channels in parallel to boost drive current. As a single product meets multi-pixel, high-current and high-brightness requirements, it can streamline customers\u2019 inventory process.Automotive Lighting Demonstration:\u00a0Full-width Rear LightRecently, in addition to using LEDs, vehicle manufacturers have gradually begun to design LED displays as vehicle lights. Using the independent control function of LEDs, the shape design of the lights is not limited. Macroblock demonstrates an LED display as a full-width rear light. The so-called full-width rear light is designed to modify the traditional rear light or the third central brake light in a strip or narrow shape. By increasing the light-emitting area to achieve visual extension, the recognition is better after being lit at night. The full-width rear light is built-in Macroblock LED driver IC MBI5353Q that meets the automotive safety integrity level ASIL A, and the pixel pitch is 0.9375mm.In addition to the use of LED displays for automotive lighting by car manufacturers, due to the increased autonomy of vehicle control in future electric vehicles/ intelligent cockpits, when the vehicle is stationary, the lighting system will be converted to display functions to transmit vehicle-related information, such as charging status, etc.In-vehicle Display Demonstration:\u00a0The FALD Backlight for an Interactive Safe Driving Screen, a Curved FALD Backlight Module for a Center Information DisplayAs vehicles were adopted more new technologies, new display usage scenarios become feasible. In addition, automakers use displays to transform vehicle interiors into futuristic and digital use experiences, creating electric vehicles/ intelligent cockpits demands for center information displays, dashboards, head-up displays, rearview mirrors, and rear-seat entertainment displays increase constantly, driving the continuous growth of vehicle display markets.Macroblock demonstrates two full-array local dimming backlight modules:1.\u00a0The FALD Backlight for an Interactive Safe Driving ScreenA display is mounted on a steering wheel to provide driving information for the driver. Its backlight module is designed with Macroblock LED driver IC MBI5353Q, which complies with the automotive safety integrity level ASIL A. MBI5353Q also features 16-bit grayscale and the high contrast ratio brought by the local dimming, providing images with details to small size displays. Furthermore, Macroblock\u2019s LED driver ICs come with a scanning architecture, compared to competitors who need to control the same number of zones, users only need one LED driver IC, MBI5353Q, to control dimming zones up to 1,536 zones.2.\u00a0A Curved FALD Backlight Module for a Center Information DisplayThe Curved Local Dimming Backlight Module is built in driver IC MBI6353Q, its innovative hybrid dimming technology, Hybrid Mode improves performances of the image at low grayscale, even in dim light, the information on the display can still be clearly delivered; In addition, MBI6353Q provides error detection with real-time reporting to meet ASIL B requirements in the vehicle safety integrity level.\u00a0In the face of the booming global electric vehicles/ intelligent cockpits markets, Macroblock continues to explore the new specifications required for future vehicles, flexibly brings the mature technology of the original product lines and advanced technology to a promising future of electric vehicles/ intelligent cockpits.\nhttps://www.mblock.com.tw/\nMost read articles\nYou may be interested in\nCompound Semiconductor\nWiPDA 2023: The 10th Edition of the IEEE Workshop on WBG Power Devices\nSensing and Actuating\nSumitomo precision products launches MEMS Infinity\u2019s foundry service\nCompound Semiconductor\nRenesas & Transphorm: Infineon Technologies opens the doors for bold acquisitions in power GaN\nBattery\nStellantis Ventures, announced its participation as a strategic investor in Tiamat, a France-based company developing and commercializing sodium-ion battery technology\nBattery\nSolid Power and SK on deepen partnership with new agreements include a research and development license, a line installation arrangement, and an electrolyte supply agreement\nRadio Frequency\nWHAT\u2019S IN THE BOX? 5G TCUs by leading Chinese companies: Joynext and Jabil\nSemiconductor Packaging\nAmkor and GlobalFoundries cut ribbon on strategic cooperation in Portugal\nPhotonics and Lighting\nAsensing unveils LiDAR at CES 2024\nComputing and Software\nAmbarella expands autonomous driving AI domain controller family with two new members; provides broadest software-compatible AI performance range\nBattery\nBASF and Stena Recycling partner in recycling of electric vehicle batteries in Europe\nYole Group in the world\nFollow us on social media\nA question?"

        "raw_content": "Login\n|\nRegister\n|\nManagement | Member Center | Contact Us\nCN\nTW\nEN\nMacroblock Debuts Next-gen Flagship LED Driver ICs-MBI5762 and MBI5780-to Support Higher Core Frequencies\nThe applications of LED displays continue to expand their boundaries: from the niche market of larger pitch applications of XR and VP to the super-fine-pitch applications of mini-/micro-LEDs targeting high-end indoor displays, such as home theaters, security rooms, etc. These applications have driven strong growth in the LED industry, echoing LEDinside\u2019s market research report in 2023. With a projected CAGR (2021-2026) of 14%, the market value of the LED display industry will reach USD 13 billion in 2026.\nNote 1: LEDinside: Global LED display market perspectives and cost analysis report\nMulti-camera and slow-motion shooting requirements for XR/VP applications | LED display supports 240 FPS video source\nIn order to reduce shooting costs and increase shooting flexibility, the demand for multi-camera shooting is increasing. The LED displays that support 60 FPS can only be shot by 2 cameras. However, LED displays that support 240 FPS can be shot by 4 cameras simultaneously. This production method is simpler for shows that target global audiences. Different rendering advertisements corresponding to different countries will be shot by other cameras, respectively. For slow-motion shooting, 240 images are captured per second and played back in 4 seconds. This decreases the performance difficulty for actors and improves smoothness.\nmini-/micro-LED displays upscale to 8K resolution | High-scan LED display to decrease component counts; driver ICs with a QFN package to reduce repair difficulties\nAs display performance requirements continue to increase, the resolution of mini-/micro-LED displays upscales. The continuing resolution upscaling trend was made evident at ISE 2023 when LG showcased a micro-LED display with 8K resolution. In addition, the shrinking pixel pitch makes the size of the LED display smaller. This means LED displays are trending closer to commercial markets.\nIn response to illuminating increasing pixels brought about by shrinking pixel pitch and resolution upscaling, an LED display with a 90-scan design can reduce driver IC counts by 65%, as compared to a 32-scan design with the same 48 channels. Moreover, we should pay attention to the driver IC package. The repair costs of LED modules are high, and driver ICs with a QFN package are much easier to rework than those with a BGA package. In this way, cost pressures can be eased.\nLED display driver IC is ready for gigabit frequency | Simulate higher frequency using lower frequency\nThe key ability of LED driver ICs to support LED displays with a high frame rate or a high scan design and maintain 16-bit grayscale at a 7,680 refresh rate is \u201ccore frequency.\u201d Macroblock upgrades driver ICs by \u201cimproving computing power\u201d and \u201calgorithm optimization.\u201d This means that the driver IC can simulate 8X core frequency and thus, can achieve 240MHz GCLK by 30MHz GCLK. Reducing the loading of the driver IC helps to decrease power consumption and achieve high-end display specifications.\nMacroblock announces next-gen common-cathode LED driver ICs\nWith continuous and tremendous R&D investments, Macroblock launched new flagship common-cathode driver ICs: MBI5762 and MBI5780 for high-end applications. Macroblock\u2019s common-cathode driver ICs use proprietary DLL frequency-boosting technology to simulate higher frequencies using lower frequencies. This decreases power consumption, enhances the power-saving feature of common-cathode architecture, and mitigates visual problems, such as color shift. The operating LED display with a lower temperature on the front side can improve user experience for indoor applications.\nMBI5762 | XR / VP LED displays\nThe product features of MBI5762 include 48 channels, a maximum 32-scan design, and an applied pitch from 0.8mm to 4mm. It also supports 240 FPS and reaches 16-bit grayscale at a 7,680Hz refresh rate. In addition, MBI5762 is equipped with a \u201cHyper Vision Calculation\u201d function that can overcome shooting problems, for example, low-gray flicker and scan lines.\nWe can learn more about visual performance through the MBI5762 module. It presents a smooth gradient and has no block or vertical stripes at grayscale 1, at a brightness of 0.06nit.\nMBI5780 | Super fine-pitch, mini-/micro-LED displays\nThe product features of MBI5762 include 48 channels, scan-sharing architecture, high integration, a maximum 90-scan design, and applied pitch starting from 0.4mm. It also supports 120 FPS and maintains excellent display performance. Due to a very narrow applied pixel pitch, power consumption will affect the visual performance. The thermal imaging below shows excellent power consumption. There is only a 4\u00b0C difference between areas with driver ICs and without driver ICs. The temperature of the PCB is less than 40\u00b0C.\nMacroblock addresses the high frame rate issues of XR and VP while providing super-fine-pitch display applications with improved solutions by solving thermal and power consumption issues. There is no doubt that this will facilitate the bright future of high-end LED displays.\nTrendForce 2024 Global LED Video Wall Market Outlook and Price Cost Analysis\nRelease Date: 28 September 2023\nLanguage: Traditional Chinese / English\nFormat: PDF\nPage: 273\nIf you would like to know more details , please contact:"

        "raw_content": "Emerging Tech\nEmerging Tech\nComputing\nInternet\nIT\nMobile Tech\nSecurity\nTechnology\nNewsletters\n10 Products From CES 2024 That Set the Innovation Bar\nI\u2019m still digging through the massive number of announcements from CES earlier this month, and I found 10 products that set the bar for innovation. These are products that I\u2019ve considered buying because they are cool or address a problem that I find compelling.\nI\u2019ll close with my Product of the Week: an app and emergency preparedness kit from Perci that may come in handy for managing the increasing number of weather-related events that hamper our lives during global climate change.\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the most innovative products from CES 2024. I\u2019ll leave off robots, which I covered in depth last week.\nThe Revolutionary Nimo PC\nI think the current generation of PCs has run its course, and it\u2019s time to step back and rethink personal computing, given the breakthrough in cloud computing, head-mounted displays, and Bluetooth technology.\nThe Nimo 1 Core is a PC the size of a mouse. It uses the Qualcomm XR2 solution designed specifically for spatial computing, and it will work with either the Nimo 1 or the Rokid Max glasses. The cost for this tiny computer is $399 without the glasses.\nI\u2019d argue that this is the first personal computer primarily designed for cloud applications because it uses a unique operating system.\nThis solution will compete with the Apple Vision Pro at a small fraction of the price.\nWith a wireless foldable keyboard and a small wireless mouse coupled with the head-mounted display, this PC provides the potential for a mobile, virtual 50-inch display in a pocket-sized solution.\nI think PCs like this are the future. They aren\u2019t the present yet, but Nimo is working to change that.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you are like me, you travel a lot and experience the pain of carrying both a laptop and a tablet. You bring both because you use the PC for work and the tablet to watch movies, so you don\u2019t run out of battery for work, and because there isn\u2019t much room for a laptop flying in coach. In addition, you can continue to use a tablet on takeoff and landing but not the laptop.\nThis dual-device approach, however, means that even if you are TSA Pre, you must pull out one of the devices because they can\u2019t scan two large devices very well when going through security. You want one device that can do both things.\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid PC does both. It\u2019s a Qualcomm-powered tablet married to an Intel laptop, providing a modular device with solid Android performance in tablet mode and decent Intel performance in PC mode in one device.\n(Images Credit: Lenovo)\nSince it is one device, you shouldn\u2019t have to pull it out when going through security, and you can use the table portion of the device to watch content during takeoff and landing. This design may be the ideal solution for combining the functionalities of both a tablet and a PC without compromising either in one integrated device.\nClicks Creator Keyboard\nBack when smartphones first came to market, they had keyboards, so we didn\u2019t have the problems we now have with distracted driving. With keyboards, you could learn how to type by feel.\nI got kicked off of the \u201cToday\u201d show during the iPhone\u2019s launch by arguing that kids who have attention issues would get into accidents because they would try to use their iPhones when driving \u2014 which clearly not only turned out to be true but applied to adults, as well, resulting in new laws and many accidents.\nWhen added to an iPhone, the Clicks creator keyboard makes the iPhone far safer because it turns the iPhone into a BlackBerry-like device with a keyboard.\nThe Clicks keyboard frees up to 50% more screen space for apps and content viewing by replacing the iPhone\u2019s on-screen typing area. (Image Credit: Clicks Technology)\nNot only does this significantly speed up how fast you can text, but you can also text by feel, reducing the need to look at your phone screen while texting.\nYou still shouldn\u2019t do this while driving, but if you do, you are more likely to survive the experience than you would with a typical screen phone. It is funny that it highlights that we never should have moved from keyboards to screen phones in the first place.\nCurrent Dual-Zone Electric Grill\n(Image Credit: Current Backyard)\nIf you are like me, you have a propane grill and must deal with having to rush out to buy propane when you want to BBQ. Not only is it a pain, but the darn tanks tend to roll around when you\u2019re driving and do ugly things to your trunk, the back of your car, or, in my case, my SUV. They are heavy when full, they can explode and represent a fire hazard, and in the winter, they are a real pain to replace. However, electric grills just can\u2019t do the job that a propane grill can \u2014 until now.\nThe Current outdoor grill appears to have the benefits of a propane grill, but it\u2019s electric and has smart features that help make you a better cook. It looks cool, too, which is why it is on my short list of things to buy for summer, and I\u2019m looking forward to retiring my propane grill. It is due out in February, and I\u2019m on the early order list as I want to say goodbye to propane. I like the dual-zone version with the cabinet best.\nBarsys 360 Robotic Bartender\nI have two robotic bartenders, one from Black and Decker, but the Barsys 360 robotic bartender is better looking than either of them, and it better integrates with a smartphone application.\nYou load it with up to three ingredients, and based on what you load into the machine, the app will give you a list of drinks you can make. It doesn\u2019t have a carbonator, but the robotic bartender I own that has one was discontinued mainly because of problems with that system.\nHere\u2019s the CES demo for the Barsys 360:\nNote that it has a built-in mixer, which neither of my existing robotic bartenders has.\nI\u2019m on the list for one of these, but given I already have two robotic bartenders, I\u2019m not sure I want or need a third. I expect that if I got this one, I\u2019d lose the two I already have, as it looks a ton better and is more advanced than the ones I currently own. It reminds me a little bit of a newer version of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d replicator.\nSkyted Voice Silencer Mask\nIf you know what you are doing, you can receive and make calls on some airplanes. But if you do, you will annoy the people around you. I once had a guy get very abusive after I did a radio interview from a plane while I was at the gate because my voice tends to carry.\nThe Skyted Silent Mask allows you to talk on your phone silently so you don\u2019t annoy people around you and don\u2019t share what you\u2019re talking about with people who shouldn\u2019t be listening to your call. This product is currently available on Kickstarter for $249, but the price will eventually increase to $599.\nIt isn\u2019t a cheap date, but it isn\u2019t as bad looking as other solutions I have seen. It seems to work very well, and it could keep your calls quiet and reduce the chance you\u2019ll get yelled at if you have to take a call in a meeting or someplace else where a phone call would be problematic.\nI have one on order and hope it will ensure that the next time I have to do an interview on a plane, it won\u2019t result in another passenger wanting to punch me out (is it just me, or have passengers on planes gotten overly violent?). If they ever enable phone calls on flights, this thing could be as important as headphones are today.\nHorwin Senmenti X Electric Motorcycle\nI don\u2019t ride anymore, but when I saw the Horwin Senmenti X, I was tempted to buy another motorcycle. Due in 2025, folks who are into anime will immediately recognize this bike as a dead ringer for the bike in Akira.\nElectric with twin swing arms (which is what the Yamaha I used to own was supposed to have) and a very low center of gravity, it should be able to corner and stop faster than any other bike on the road, electric or otherwise. This thing looks like it came from the future. I imagine it would pull a ton of interest at motorcycle events and on rides.\nIf you like motorcycles and want to ride into the future, Horwin had several cutting-edge designs, but the one that excited me was this Senmenti X. Now I want to watch Akira again.\nPebble Flow Electric Car-Focused Camper Trailer\nI\u2019ve been watching the Pebble Flow camper trailer like a hawk even before CES, as it is an amazing trailer:\nThe problem, well, one of the problems with electric cars and trucks is that they lose a ton of range when pulling a trailer. But:\nThat is the Pebble Flow, designed for electric cars. This thing is amazing!\nYou can live off the grid for up to seven days with full power to all of the appliances, heating, and cooling, and it has 3x the electrical capacity of one Tesla Powerwall. This is the world\u2019s first dual-motor electric camper trailer, and it is a sign of things to come. I am so tempted to buy it.\nBrelyon Ultra Reality Display\n(Image Credit: Brelyon)\nI\u2019m a fan of head-mounted displays. While I use them when traveling, I don\u2019t use them in my home office. However, the idea of creating a monitor that uses technology to get the size of the device down to something more manageable appeals to me.\nCurrently, I use a Dell 49-inch monitor, but it is wider than my field of view when closed, and if I back away from it, everything gets smaller, which undoes the advantage of size. Plus, it entirely blocks any view out of my office window.\nThe Brelyon Ultra Reality Display is designed to be closer to your face. Similar to a head-mounted display, it employs high resolution to present the experience of a massive screen, eliminating the need for an actual large screen.\nYou get the equivalent of a 122-inch screen in a 32-inch form factor, so it\u2019s a smaller monitor with more screen real estate than my massive 49-inch screen. At $12,000, it is outside my price range for a monitor but could be ideal for a trader, coder, animator, engineer, or anyone else who needs a massive screen in a small form factor.\nIt is on my lust list, but I\u2019ll wait until the price comes down.\nRabbit R1\nFinally, we have the Rabbit R1, a wearable device (like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d communicator) that, for $199, gives you a body camera (handy for capturing YouTube events around you) and a better voice interface for your smartphone. It is in beta right now, and I think it could use some work on its industrial design as it looks more like a toy than the serious device it is.\nI expect products like this will become far more common as AI advances and we use these new, more advanced Siri-like capabilities more broadly. It has a natural language interface, and while initially it will work with most smartphones, it could represent an iPhone-like revolution to the current phone design.\nThe Rabbit R1 could represent the future of smartphones and is worth checking out. I just wish it looked more like a product from \u201cStar Trek\u201d rather than a product from some kid\u2019s TV show.\nWrapping Up\nCES was expensive this year as I saw 10 products that I wanted, and I ended up ordering several. I saw the future of robotics, PCs and monitors, smartphones, grilling, motorcycles, and voice communications at the show. I\u2019m already looking forward to next year, when I expect things will become even more exciting and expensive for me.\nPerci App and Vest Disaster Preparedness Kit\nWe have a lot of fires where I live. With the current weather, we\u2019re looking at some potential for flooding. There\u2019s also a huge fault line near our border, and we just had a killer snowstorm that made getting around problematic.\nAs a result, with global warming, we all need to do a better job with disaster preparedness, and the Perci app and vest are an effective way to start.\nEquipped with 25 essential items in easily accessible pockets, the Perci app and vest disaster preparedness kit is a comprehensive solution for any survival checklist. (Image Credit: Invicta Ready)\nThe app assists in rapid emergency preparedness by guiding you to prepare a packing list, establish a family meeting point, and form a trust circle for assistance. It also helps secure your home, create an inventory for insurance purposes, and consolidate real-time disaster alerts to ensure you don\u2019t miss critical updates.\nYou can order a vest equipped with essential emergency supplies, including medical items, hygiene products like toothpaste, and water purification tablets, providing critical resources needed in a disaster.\nWith the changes to the weather and other natural or human-caused catastrophes likely to become more common, we all need to become better prepared to run when the need arises. The Perci app and vest address that problem nicely, and it is my Product of the Week.\nRob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

The two new products are suitable for the application of intelligent automotive lighting, and both of them have obtained the AEC-Q100 qualification. The company is positive about the future outlook of the global intelligent automobile market. By launching these two new products, Macroblock has a more complete automotive series product line. Macroblock will continuously focus on the automobile original equipment market and keep developing other new products to assist each brand to maximize business value.\nMacroblock latest automotive lighting ICs, MBI6659Q and MBI6665Q, have successfully passed AEC-Q100\nAs compared to the ordinary electronic products, automotive electronics have stricter standards for their components. The Automotive Electronics Council (AEC) established AEC-Q100 qualification standard for automotive IC, and the test qualification is rigorous. Macroblock's automotive series products have all passed this certification to make sure that the reliability and stability of ICs meet AEC's requirements.\nMacroblock LED automotive IC product line can be divided into two categories, the first is the automotive display, and the other is the automotive lighting. Both MBI6659Q and MBI6665Q are categorized as automotive lighting.\nAbout MBI6659Q\nThe applications of MBI6659Q include fog lights, tail lights, brake lights, ambient lights, position lamp and daytime running lamp (DRL). Its current rating is 2.5A. Comparing with the previous MBI6657Q, MBI6659Q is a high-current version, providing flexible design options to customers. MBI6659Q owns LDO (Low Dropout Regulator), which means that this driver IC can directly supply MCU voltage, so that the MCU does not need an additional power supply. This allows the layout of this automotive lighting power system is cleaner and neater. Moreover, this product features EMI solution, which can improve EMI performance to pass EMC testing standards as well as reducing external components. MBI6659Q also has several protection modes, such as LED open, LED short, thermal shutdown, thermal fold-back and so on, to ensure safety.\nAbout MBI6665Q\nThe applications of MBI6665Q include head lights, tail lights, brake lights and daytime running lights. This driver IC supports multi-topology DC/DC power management to assist customers to design their products. Moreover, same as MBI6659Q, MBI6665Q owns LDO, which can supply MCU voltage and make the layout of the power system tidy. It also features EMI solution to eliminate EMI. In addition to having the same protection modes as MBI6659Q, MBI6665Q also has OTP (Over Temperature Protection) and OCP (Over Current Protection) to ensure adequate safety provision.\nAs an LED driver IC leader, Macroblock expects a very promising future of the automobile industry; especially that electric vehicles and self-driving cars are the recent trending topics in the market. LED now is the mainstream in the field of automotive lighting. Macroblock will work closely with our partners to deploy on the automobile market and will keep designing automotive lighting ICs and automotive display ICs to fulfill customers\u2019 needs. Macroblock will cooperate with global automakers to create more modern and fashionable automotive lighting and bring a warmer human-vehicle interactive experience to the car owners.\nTrendForce 2020-2021 Global Automotive LED Product Trend and Regional Market Analysis\nRelease Date:\n1.

Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate. If a company has less than 10 years of experience, it loses points in this category.\nAshburn, VA Window Replacement FAQs\nHow much does a window install cost?\nThe average cost of installing a single window can range between $450 and $650. There are a variety of factors that affect how much it costs, including your property's location, the materials used in designing the windows, how energy-efficient the windows are, local labor costs, styles and sizes of windows and the number of windows.\nWhat are the types of windows?\nThere are several different kinds of windows you can get for your home, including slider windows, double-hung and single-hung windows, picture windows, casement windows, awning windows, bay windows and transom windows.\nDo you really need to use a window installation company?\nYou should hire a window installation company whenever you need to replace your windows. Installing windows is a involved process that can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's best left to the professionals.\nHow do you know it's time to replace your windows?\nWindows typically have a lifespan of around 20 to 30 years, but anytime you notice damage on your windows, it's a good time to have an expert take a look at them to see if they need any repairs or replacements.\nShould I replace my windows all at once?\nIf your windows are more than 20 years old, it's probably time to replace all of them. By that point, they are usually less efficient, leakier and/or more damaged than new windows. Replacing your windows all at the same time will involve less paperwork and less time.\nOther Services in Ashburn\nMore window replacement & installers Near Me"
