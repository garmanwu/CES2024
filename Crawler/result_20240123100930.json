        "raw_content": "L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s futuristic hairdryer uses infrared light for smoother, more hydrated hair\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s futuristic hairdryer uses infrared light for smoother, more hydrated hair\nThe AirLight Pro promises to dry hair up to 30 percent faster, use less power, and reduce heat. It also comes with smart attachments.\nBy\nVictoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\nShare this story\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al has been a staple of CES for years, showing up with surprising twists on beauty products like a wearable UV sensor, a lipstick printer, and an AR-powered brow applicator. This year, the company is taking on\u00a0the classic hairdryer with the AirLight Pro,\u00a0and it\u2019s doing so in an unconventional way.\nMost conventional hairdryers rely on thermal coils to produce heat and air that then dries the hair. Unless you use heat protectant, it can be pretty brutal on your hair with frequent use. Meanwhile, Dyson\u2019s Supersonic hairdryer mostly uses a powerful motor and clever ergonomic design to maximize airflow while also reducing heat. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s AirLight Pro also does that, but it adds infrared light into the mix.\n\u201cIt\u2019s inspired by the way the environment dries rain. So when it rains, the day after you have wind, you have sun, and it\u2019s a combination of the wind and sun that are the most effective to dry the rain,\u201d says Guive Balooch, global vice president of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Technology Incubator. In the same way, Balooch says that a mix of infrared light and powerful airflow help mimic the sun and wind but for your hair. That, in turn, reduces the need for heat.\nAccording to Balooch, the hairdryer has a circle of infrared lights and, within that, there\u2019s a smaller circle that pushes out the air. The light helps water droplets dry on the surface of the hair, while leaving moisture intact within the strand. Balooch says that different wavelengths of infrared light can have opposite effects on hair. For example, the red / yellow end of the spectrum is closer to UV light \u2014 which isn\u2019t so great for your hair. Blue and purple light, however, has a more hydrating effect. The result is supposedly a 30 percent faster drying time and a 31 percent reduction in energy usage, with more hydrated and smoother-looking hair in the process. Of course, we\u2019ll have to test it out to see how those claims translate in real life, but I\u2019m curious to get my hands on the AirLight Pro on the show floor later this week.\nTo make the hairdryer, L\u2019Or\u00e9al partnered with Zuvi, a startup founded by former DJI engineers that made a similar light-based hairdryer. The AirLight Pro is the result of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s team collaborating with Zuvi to take it to the next level. That includes developing an app, where users can customize heat preferences, and a set of smart attachments, including a diffuser and a concentrator nozzle. When you snap on an attachment, the hairdryer will automatically recognize it and adjust the speed and temperature.\nThe AirLight Pro is targeted for both professional and consumer use \u2014 though it\u2019ll first be available at salons under the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionnel brand. It\u2019s expected to reach consumers later in the year, and Balooch says the company is targeting a sub-$400 price.\nBalooch also offered up a few updates on other products L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s shown off at CES over the years. The Colorsonic, an at-home hair dying gadget from CES 2022, is currently in production with a launch slated for mid-2024. Meanwhile, last year\u2019s Brow Magic makeup applicator will first launch in Asia at the end of 2024 under the Shu Uemura brand. Seeing CES concept gadgets actually make their way to consumers isn\u2019t a given, so it\u2019s neat to see L\u2019Or\u00e9al actively working to make its ideas a reality.\nFord\u2019s new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car\nApple\u2019s sci-fi thriller Constellation gets haunting first trailer\niOS 17.3 is out, adding Stolen Device Protection for your iPhone\nThe Vision Pro\u2019s first killer app is the web, whether Apple likes it or not\nSamsung\u2019s smart ring might signal the start of a new wearable era\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBeauty tech is here at CES.\nThe Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered gadget that can use your apps for you\nEcoFlow\u2019s scalable solar generator can power your entire home or just a weekend away\nThe Skyted mask looks ridiculous but might actually make sense!\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Not only is this is a key moment for the brand, but also the wider beauty industry, and highlights L\u2019Or\u00e9al as a pioneer in the beauty tech space.\nIn a bid to use technology to solve consumer needs, L\u2019Or\u00e9al is also taking the opportunity to unveil the\u00a0Airlight Pro, a breakthrough professional-grade hair dryer. Developed in partnership with Zuvi, the AirLight Pro uses a combination of infrared-light technology and wind to care for the hair, whilst also drying faster thanks to optimised heat flow. It's also able to style\u00a0multiple hair types, and uses up to 31% less energy consumption than some of the best hair dryers on the market.\n\u201cZuvi\u2019s mission is to leave the world better than we found it by disrupting technologies and innovating for the future,\u201d said\u00a0Mingyu\u00a0Wang, Founder and CEO of Zuvi. \u201cWith our expertise in optics, aerodynamics, and consumer electronics design, we have created an exceptional product.

Unlike conventional hair dryers that feature only thermal rods, the AirLight Pro is equipped with a special 17-blade, high-speed motor and infrared technology to deliver fast hair drying without excessive heat. By efficiently drying water on the hair surface, hair is left with internal moisture in the strand resulting in smooth, shiny hair.\n\u201cFor over a decade, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Research and Innovation has been creating a new Beauty Science powered by Technology: Augmented Beauty.

That's the future of beauty we are aiming to create.\"\nIntroducing AirLight Pro\nL'Or\u00e9al, a scientific and industry expert in haircare from the cellular level to the fiber for every hair type (curly, straight, and coily), partnered with hardware startup Zuvi to develop and deliver a next-generation hair drying tool for beauty professionals and then to consumers worldwide that focuses on caring for the hair through breakthrough technology.\n\"Zuvi's mission is to leave the world better than we found it by disrupting technologies and innovating for the future,\" said Mingyu Wang, Founder and CEO of Zuvi. \"With our expertise in optics, aerodynamics, and consumer electronics design, we have created an exceptional product. We're immensely proud of the work we've done to date and now to have a partner like L'Or\u00e9al, a company with more than 100 years of expertise in haircare and beauty, to take our products to the next level. Together, we are and will continue to create ground-breaking beauty technologies.\"\nApplying their patented LightCare\u2122 technology to a blow-dryer, Zuvi developed a first-generation product that uses infrared light and high-speed wind to efficiently dry water on the hair surface, which leaves internal moisture in hair strands.\nA team of over 100 engineers, designers, hairdressers, and scientists from L'Or\u00e9al's Research & Innovation Division and Zuvi collaborated on AirLight Pro's cutting-edge industrial design to develop a professional-grade hair drying tool that breaks through barriers of performance. AirLight Pro delivers up to 33% more hydrated hair*4, up to 59% visually smoother hair*5, faster drying times, and an enhanced user experience based on feedback from leading professional stylists. It is also able to deliver up to 31% less energy consumption*6.\nUnlike conventional heating hair dryers with only heating coils, AirLight Pro is equipped with a special 17-blade, high-speed motor and patented*7\u00a0infrared technology powered by tungsten\u2013halogen bulbs designed for fast hair drying without excessive heat. By efficiently drying water on the hair surface, hair is left with internal moisture in the strand resulting in smooth, shiny hair.\nTested by L'Or\u00e9al on more than 500 people across multiple hair types, AirLight Pro is designed to adapt to the needs of the individual user. The hardware, firmware, and app work seamlessly to make it possible for every user to customize the settings for their individual needs.\n\"For over a decade, L'Or\u00e9al Research and Innovation has been creating a new Beauty Science powered by Technology: Augmented Beauty. Technology that truly answers age-old consumer needs with unparalleled results,\" said Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L'Or\u00e9al. \"AirLight Pro, with over 150 patents filed, perfectly embodies this breakthrough in beauty by, for the first time, bringing a solution for drying while caring for the hair as well as the planet.\"\nL'Or\u00e9al made a minority investment in Zuvi through its corporate venture fund, BOLD Business Opportunities for L'Or\u00e9al Development.\nAirLight Pro will be launched in select markets such as the United States and Europe by its salon professional brand, L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel, in 2024 to both beauty professionals and consumers.\n\"As the historical brand leader and trusted partner of hairstylists since 1909, L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel has always elevated the professional industry with pioneering innovations,\" said Anne Machet, General Manager for L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel. \"We're thrilled to partner with Zuvi and invent the new generation of hair dryer.
