Under the theme of \u201cReinvent your future,\u201d LG\u2019s exhibition presents how the company will elevate customer experiences in everyday lives through its latest innovations \u2013 including the transparent and wireless 4K LG SIGNATURE OLED TV; a smart home powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies; and the mobility concept Alpha-able.\nThe Ultimate TV Experience With Innovative Technology and Infinite Content\nThe heart of LG\u2019s booth is the world\u2019s first transparent and wireless 4K OLED TV, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T. Visitors are greeted by a massive media art display created by combining fifteen 77-inch OLED Ts, showcasing captivating video content with perfect black levels and vibrant colors. These displays gradually transform into a transparent OLED TV, revealing a new era uncovered by OLED T. The floating appearance of the OLED TVs emphasizes the wireless transmission of video and audio signals and connection to external devices, simplifying installation and providing more freedom in interior design.\nA dedicated zone highlights the LG SIGNATURE OLED T\u2019s transparent and wireless technology, which allows the TV to exceed the constraints of space and seamlessly blend into everyday life. Serving as a TV that complements the interior design of any space, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers an extension of future living experiences. Additionally, the transparent screen enhances the viewing experience of media artworks by adding depth and dimensionality.\nMoving on to the next zone, visitors encounter an impressive tunnel structure featuring over 140 55-inch OLED displays. This webOS experience Zone serves as a platform to showcase an extensive range of content, curated through collaborations with diverse partners.

This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the \u2018Smart Life Solution\u2019 Experience\nIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company\u2019s AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people\u2019s lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers\u2019 words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers\u2019 heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend\u2019s presence, automatically asking whether to download the \u2018pet mode\u2019 on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers\u2019 daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG\u2019s Future Mobility Concept\nGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \u201cpersonalized digital cave.\u201d To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG\u2019s mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG\u2019s unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers\u2019 needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG\u2019s EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG Vision\nLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company\u2019s experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG\u2019s home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its \u2018Universal UP Kit\u2019, a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG\u2019s latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

Meanwhile, the rise of OTT platforms has given people the freedom to watch their favorite content at their convenience, anytime and anywhere. However, limitations persisted in terms of screen devices that wouldn\u2019t allow content to be consumed wherever one may desire, until the debut of the LG StanbyME and LG StanbyME Go.\nThe StanbyME lineup began with an experimental question posed by a designer at LG\u2019s HE Design Lab: \u201cWhat if my TV could move to wherever I am, whenever I want to watch it?\u201d This was the moment of curiosity that sparked innovation, transforming and reimagining the TV experience.\nFrom the outset, the designs of the two Lifestyle Screens had to be different, as the LG HE Design Lab team was given the challenge to conceptualize a screen that could be \u2018on the go.\u2019 Deviating from the traditional TV design, the team created a product with no complex components visible on the back, featuring a simple frame and minimalist edge stand to maximize space utilization and deliver flexibility that blends into any composition.\nWith the appearance and functionality of a carry bag, the StanbyME Go is purposefully designed to withstand shock, vibration and chemical reactions, providing unparalleled portability and durability. For a heightened experience with better interaction, the display movement intends to closely match the user\u2019s posture.\nTraditionally, portability has not been closely associated with TV products, but LG sought to pioneer versatile lifestyle screens that expand the role of TVs far beyond image broadcasting. The StanbyME and StanbyME Go are companions for everyday life; they can transform into recipe books when cooking in the kitchen, sheet music when playing the piano, and small outdoor movie theaters when camping, reimagining the way users engage with TVs.\nWhen selecting which TV to purchase, the foremost consideration should be how well it fits into your space. With the ability to easily change their location, the StanbyME and StanbyME Go stand out as exceptional choices to set the ideal mood in any space.\nUnlocking new possibilities for creating unique mood and experiences, the StanbyME and StanbyME Go offer portability that allows users to carry or position them wherever they desire. Enjoy a movie night in your cozy bedroom, soft music on the terrace of your home caf\u00e9, a workout in your home gym or a celebration message in a party room. With unbounded imagination, the possibilities are endless.\nHowever, why limit your TV experience to the indoors? The StanbyME Go has created new on-the-go entertainment opportunities for outdoor use with its great portability and versatility. The StanbyME Go can serve as a digital campfire for relaxed downtime or transform into a lively board game hub during family road trips. Featuring a turntable skin that enables users to immerse themselves in music and create a relaxing mood on the beach, this all-round lifestyle screen ensures hours of enjoyable entertainment for all.\nFor more on how the LG HE Design Lab delivers new experiences and enriches your lifestyle with innovative designs, stay tuned to the LG Newsroom.\n# # #\n* LG StanbyME and LG StanbyME GO are WiFi-enabled models that can be used by connecting to a wireless network.\nLG Unveils Latest HVAC Solutions at AHR Expo 2024\nCompany\u2019s Focus on Sustainable Solutions, Whole Home Electrification and\nCommercial Innovations on Display at World\u2019s Largest HVAC Industry Tradeshow\nSEOUL, Jan. 22, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) is unveiling its latest heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) solutions at AHR Expo 2024, taking place in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., from January 22-24. LG\u2019s energy-efficient residential and commercial HVAC lineups on show at this year\u2019s event deliver exceptional performance and demonstrate the company\u2019s steadfast commitment to environmental responsibility.\nIn the Air Solution booth, LG is putting the spotlight on several of its cutting-edge HVAC solutions. These include the R32 air-to-water heat pump and furnace, and the Multi F heat pump, both designed for residential applications, and the new Multi V\u2122 i Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) solution for commercial use.\nVisitors to the Home Electrification Solutions Zone can get a firsthand look at LG\u2019s R32 air-to-water heat pump, which employs the low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerant, R32. Meeting the latest refrigerant standards,1 R32 contributes to the solution\u2019s ability to deliver a reliable heating performance at low temperatures. The zone also features the stylish ARTCOOL\u2122 Gallery air conditioner. First unveiled at CES 2023, the distinctive ARTCOOL Gallery boasts the company\u2019s state-of-the-art DUAL Inverter Compressor\u2122 and 3-way indirect flow.\nAdditionally, the Home Electrification Zone highlights LG\u2019s expertise in custom HVAC system design using versatile solutions such as the Multi F heat pump. Compatible with various indoor units and able to adapt to a wide range of buildings and appliances, the Multi F ensures a comfortable indoor environment, even in extreme climates.\nDisplayed in the Home Air and Water Solutions Zone, LG\u2019s Inverter heat pump water heater is an energy-efficient alternative to a conventional electricity- or gas-powered heater.2 It can heat up to 80 gallons of water at a time, providing a large supply of hot water and a dependable performance. LG\u2019s innovative water heater enhances user convenience as well, offering seamless remote control and handy maintenance notifications via LG ThinQ\u2122 app.\nThe company\u2019s Multi-Position Air Handler Heat Pump provides homeowners with a new level of flexibility and comfort, even in cold climate zones. This solution provides optimal temperature control year-round, cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and can be configured for vertical upflow, downflow, or horizontal left or right installation, fitting seamlessly into your home\u2019s existing setup.\nIn the Commercial Zone, LG is presenting its new Multi V\u2122 i VRF solution, which is designed for use in mid- to high-rise commercial buildings. Equipped with LG\u2019s highly evolved AI engine, the new Multi V i analyzes operational data to enhance comfort, save energy and provide smart diagnosis functions.\nLocated next to the Air Solution booth, the Component Solutions booth illustrates LG\u2019s ongoing commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency. Among the core product components displayed there are the company\u2019s new residential compressors with low-GWP refrigerants, which are already compliant with new U.S. regulations on refrigerant use.1 The booth also features LG\u2019s scroll compressors for the commercial market and the company\u2019s latest HVAC fan motor lineup.\n\u201cOur cutting-edge HVAC solutions at AHR Expo 2024 show that LG is playing a leading role in the global progress towards \u2018electrification,\u2019 and in prioritizing sustainability in HVAC design,\u201d said James Lee, head of the Air Solution Business Unit at LG Electronics Home Appliance & Air Solution Company. \u201cWe will continue to introduce energy-efficient and high-performance HVAC solutions that further solidify our strong position in the global air conditioning market and support LG\u2019s global strategy as a Smart Home Solution provider.\u201d\nVisit LG\u2019s booth (#S8345, #8349, McCormick Place) at AHR Expo 2024 to explore the full portfolio of LG HVAC solutions.\n# # #\n1 The state of California has passed legislation that will ban the use of refrigerants with a GWP over 750 from the year 2025.\n2 LG\u2019s Inverter Heat Pump Water Heater using a DUAL Inverter compressor heats water with an efficiency of 3.93 Uniform Energy Factor (UEF), whereas conventional electric water heater achieves 0.93 UEF, and conventional gas water heater achieves 0.70 UEF.\nLG Opens New Scroll Compressor Production Line in Mexico\nIncreased Manufacturing Capacity to Strengthen Company\u2019s Competitiveness,\nHelp It Meet Growing Demand From North American Businesses\nSEOUL, Jan. 19, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) announces the opening of a new scroll compressor production line at its factory in Monterrey, Mexico. The new line bolsters LG\u2019s scroll compressor manufacturing infrastructure, enabling the company to produce more of its acclaimed, eco-conscious solutions while creating a shorter supply chain for servicing customers across North America.\nLG\u2019s decision to establish a production line in Mexico comes at a time when many U.S. heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) manufacturers are facing challenges due to escalating logistical disruptions. The strategic move places an LG scroll compressor production base in close proximity to key North American markets; setting up a production/logistics system that will help the company better respond to regional demand and lessen the impact on customers of factors such as logistic issues.\nLG\u2019s scroll compressors play a major role in the company\u2019s HVAC components business. At AHR Expo 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia, LG showcased its energy-efficient Gen 3 Scroll Compressors for residential air conditioners and heat pumps, as well as large-capacity scroll compressors for commercial system air conditioning.\nDesigned with the future in mind, Gen 3 Scroll Compressors are symbolic of LG\u2019s continuing leadership in HVAC innovation.

The state also boasts excellent logistics and transportation networks and is home to major operations for companies in industries ranging from automobile manufacturing to finance.\nIn 2023, when announcing the company\u2019s future vision, LG CEO William Cho noted that \u2018Electrification\u2019 would be a major driver of rapid mid- to long-term growth. LG\u2019s entry into the U.S. EV charging market will enable the company to address rising local demand and discover new business opportunities. Strategically and philosophically aligned with several of the energy and environmental goals set out in the U.S. government\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, the sustainability-focused company is committed to bolstering its EV charger business, and has commenced plans to grow its presence around the world, including in Asia and Europe.\nLG has started assembling 11kW chargers at its Texas factory and will begin production of 175kW fast chargers within the first half of the year. LG also aims to introduce a 350kW ultra-fast charger in 2024, expanding its EV charger lineup to meet the varied needs of customers, especially those operating in areas such as commercial travel and long-distance transportation.\nThe company is quickly earning a reputation as a reliable EV charger provider thanks to its manufacturing capabilities, quality control and after-sales service. Through emphasizing its differentiated offerings, including control and advertising solutions, LG is confident that the EV charging solutions business will continue to improve its market position over the mid- to long-term.\nFurthermore, LG intends to tap into the diverse EV charging demands of various businesses and facilities, such as hotels, shopping malls, retail stores, gas stations and parking garages, to drive future growth. LG\u2019s B2B experience in the U.S. hotel TV and digital signage sectors provides valuable insight that is expected to aid in the U.S. expansion of the company\u2019s EV charging solutions business.\nThe global EV charging market is expected to grow to USD 186 billion by 2030, according to Roland Berger, a global management consulting firm. The market expansion is being driven by several factors, including the ongoing implementation of regulations aimed at protecting the environment and the continuous progress of vehicle electrification.\n\u201cBy establishing our EV charger production factory in Texas, we will be able to actively respond to the rapidly growing demand for EV infrastructure in the U.S.,\u201d said Jang Ik-hwan, president of the LG Business Solutions Company. \u201cLG is dedicated to delivering uncompromising quality and will offer customers reliable EV charging solutions that combine efficient charger units with advanced control systems.\u201d\n# # #\nInnovations Lifting Customer Experience on Full Display at CES 2024\nFrom January 9-12, LG displayed its newest innovations at CES 2024 under the theme of \u2018Reinvent your future.\u2019 This meticulously curated booth, featuring zones across various spaces, demonstrated LG\u2019s expansion beyond the home into new areas, such as mobility and commercial spaces, in its journey to become a \u2018smart life solution company.\u2019\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of LG\u2019s cutting-edge products introduced at CES 2024, designed to make life better not only for customers but the earth as well.\nBefore entering LG\u2019s booth, visitors were welcomed by the familiar hues of LG Active Red, a signature color for the company.

The massive media art display, comprised of fifteen 77-inch LG OLED Ts seemingly floating in the air, highlighted the TV\u2019s ability to move freely without being constrained by wires or cords \u2013 a feat made possible by the Zero Connect Box.\nIn the \u2018Life with OLED T\u2019 zone, created in collaboration with premium Dutch lifestyle brand Moooi, LG presented how the LG OLED T can redefine the screen experience, liberating the space and transforming into a design object to open a realm of possibilities like never before.

The company aims to overcome challenges, such as persistent market and supply chain uncertainties, and accelerate growth by building a high-performance, results-oriented organization with a winning spirit.\n\u201cIf 2023 was the year in which we set the direction for new changes, we will make 2024 the year in which we truly accelerate these changes,\u201d said CEO Cho. \u201cFuture Vision 2030 is our promise to the market and to our customers, and we will strive as a company to deliver on this promise.\u201d\nAnnounced by the CEO last year, Future Vision 2030 is LG\u2019s long-term goal to transform into \u2018Smart Life Solution Company\u2019 that can connect and expand the customer experience across various spaces, including home, commercial, mobility and virtual.\nStrengthening Future Competitiveness Through Investment\nCEO Cho set \u2018Break through Limits\u2019 as the key phrase for, and underlying philosophy of the company\u2019s management policy in 2024. Having already established three focus areas for future growth \u2013 a non-hardware business model, B2B expansion and the development of new businesses \u2013 LG will now make an all-out effort to further refine its portfolio.\nTo start with, the company will maximize the potential of its future growth engines by expanding investment based on the strategic priorities of the business. This year, the company will more than double its level of investment; putting USD 8 billion* into R&D and other critical areas to strengthen competitiveness, moving forward.\nHigh-growth and high-profit core businesses will also see larger investment in 2024. These include B2B businesses, such as vehicle components, HVAC, built-in appliances and digital signage, as well as the webOS platform business. LG will continue to invest in new businesses, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and robotics, and has already announced plans to invest more than USD 40 billion* by 2030 to transform its portfolio for qualitative business growth.\nFurthermore, beginning this year, LG will actively seek inorganic growth opportunities, such as mergers, acquisitions and partnerships, in addition to adopting strategies designed to invigorate its internal growth engines. Emphasis will also be placed on game-changing areas of technology that add customer value, such as AI and mixed reality (MR).\nThe CEO identified the newly established Overseas Sales and Marketing Company as a valuable asset for helping LG \u201cbreak through limits.\u201d Already playing an important role in LG\u2019s global success, the new organization accounted for approximately two-thirds of the company\u2019s total sales. The Overseas Sales and Marketing Company implements specialized strategies that take into consideration the unique characteristics of each region and market. Its efforts have maximized the performance of the business, worldwide, and have played a significant role in strengthening the capabilities and growth of LG\u2019s international subsidiaries.\nAchieving \u2018Triple Seven\u2019 Goals for Growth, Profit and Value\nWith platform-based service businesses, the B2B business and new businesses as its three, main growth engines, the company aims to reach its goal of \u2018Triple Seven\u2019: an average growth rate and operating profit of seven percent or more, as well as enterprise value that translates to an EBITDA ratio of seven.\nLast year, despite a decline in market demand, the company performed impressively thanks to the growth of its B2B business. Over the past five years, the compound annual growth rate of LG\u2019s B2B businesses has easily exceeded double digits, with the average annual growth rate of overall sales reaching around eight percent.\nThe Vehicle component Solutions (VS) Company has likewise emerged as a key business for LG, achieving annual sales of USD 8 billion* in its 10th year of existence. The global transition to EVs is expected to increase the demand for high-value EV parts, one of the VS Company\u2019s core areas of expertise.\nBased on the three pillars of in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), e-powertrains and vehicular lamps, the VS Company is projected to enjoy continuous, rapid growth. From 2024, it will focus primarily on securing software-defined vehicle capabilities, expanding its EV parts customer-base, and strengthening its leadership in smart lamps. To respond to the increasing number of new orders, the company will invest in boosting production capacity in Central America, South America and Europe.\nThe HVAC business, another important part of LG\u2019s B2B portfolio, is growing quickly in emerging markets such as Asia and Central and South America, while in advanced markets, including Europe and North America \u2013 where demand for high-efficiency, eco-friendly products is strong \u2013 it continues to uncover new opportunities.\nLG\u2019s HVAC business aims to leverage the competitiveness of its technologically advanced components, such as motors and compressors, to expand its product lineup. After establishing a consortium for advanced heat pump research in Alaska, U.S.A., last November, LG plans to build an R&D base in Europe this year. The company also intends to broaden its business with the introduction of differentiated air conditioning products, such as the Dedicated Outdoor Air System.\nRecognizing that B2B companies are impacted less directly by the economy than B2C companies, LG is actively bolstering its B2B business as a means to maintain sales and profit stability. The company has announced plans for the expansion of its B2B businesses, and is seeking to raise sales volume to more than USD 32 billion* (double the current level) by 2030 through launching a variety of new, value-added solutions.\nLG will also fast-track the evolution of its overall business model, entering non-hardware areas, such as content, services and subscriptions, to complement its existing product-centric home appliance and TV companies. Leveraging the hundreds of millions of LG products already in use around the world as \u2018platforms,\u2019 the company expects to generate continuous sales and profits.\nIn line with this shift in business direction, the Home Entertainment (HE) Company aims to become a media and entertainment platform company and accelerate the growth of its webOS platform business. The HE Company is rapidly reinforcing the foundations of its platform business by expanding the webOS ecosystem to include smart monitors, IVI systems, and other TV makers. LG expects the webOS platform business to become one of the most potential growth engines \u00a0in the near future.\nThe Home Appliance and Air Solution (H&A) Company, whose success is playing a preeminent role in supporting LG\u2019s organization-wide transformation, is also developing a smart home solution business that combines services and subscriptions. The H&A Company\u2019s ultimate goal is to deliver on its \u2018Zero Labor Home, Makes Quality Time\u2019 vision, which goes beyond home appliances to make homelife smarter and more convenient than ever.\nThe subscription business, encompassing \u2018daily\u2019 services that augment LG\u2019s home appliance products, has been growing at a fast pace in South Korea. The overseas expansion of the subscription business is underway, with strategic markets in Asia the first outside of Korea to experience its many benefits.\nThe percentage of LG\u2019s total sales accounted for by its non-hardware businesses \u2013 such as the webOS platform-based content and service business, and the home appliance subscription business \u2013 has more than doubled over the past five years.\nAdditionally, LG will aggressively promote the commercialization of intangible assets, such as its standard essential patents in critical areas of technology including communications, media, mobility and IoT connectivity. And, during its recent reorganization, the company established new business entities to commercialize its know-how in the construction of smart factories.\nMoreover, LG will secure growth opportunities offering high potential and a high degree of business synergy. As a prime example, the LG NOVA will increase its startup promotion fund to more than USD 100 million by the end of 2024, enabling the company to help discover new technologies and solutions to drive future innovation, and to lead new business segments.\nLG\u2019s recently created EV charging business is emerging as a comprehensive EV charging solutions provider, boasting advanced charging units and control solutions, remote diagnosis and servicing capabilities, as well as vehicle battery diagnosis and robust manufacturing and sales infrastructure. Entering the North American market, the company has completed the construction of a charger production line in Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.A.\nIn the digital healthcare segment, the company is expanding its telemedicine business in cooperation with Amwell, and will also review the viability of offering services in areas such as prevention, diagnosis, post-management and recovery. In virtual reality, another promising business area, LG is preparing for the commercialization of MR devices. At the end of 2023, the company established an eXtended Reality business unit within the HE Company, and is continuing to collaborate on augmented reality solutions with various technology partners.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s Chief Technology Office (CTO), which leads the development of future technologies, is conducting intensive R&D programs to strengthen business competitiveness and discover new core technologies. In particular, the CTO is focusing on eight areas of technology: software, system on chip, AI, robotics, materials and parts, standards, next-generation computing and cloud/data.\nAccelerating DX Through Data-Driven Practices and Next-Gen ERP Investment\nThrough digital transformation (DX), LG will provide customers with F.U.N. \u2013 First, Unique and New \u2013 experiences, and further enhance its customer-centric management system.\nThe company is making large-scale IT investments to establish DX across the entire organization. On top of this, LG is building N-ERP, or Next-generation Enterprise Resource Planning, to seamlessly integrate and link the company\u2019s business processes and systems. Intellytics Customer 360, a customer data platform that enables integrated management of data gathered from diverse customer contact points, will be rolled out globally from this year.\nLG\u2019s DX efforts extend beyond the innovation of the customer experience to the improvement of value chain efficiency; from purchasing and manufacturing to delivery and sales. Last year, by applying DX to each value chain, LG raised productivity and efficiency to the value of more than USD 240 million.*\nTransforming Into a High-Performing Organization and Spreading \u2018Life\u2019s Good\u2019 Values and Philosophy\nWhen speaking with employees, CEO Cho often quotes noted American management scholar, Peter Drucker: \u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast.\u201d The CEO truly believes that a strong organizational culture is essential to turning strategy into good performance.\nDuring his \u2018CEO F.U.N. Talk\u2019 with employees last December, Mr. Cho outlined the company\u2019s vision for 2024, which includes becoming a high-performing organization. He stated that, \u201cTo accomplish this, we need to intricately connect our mission, vision and goals, and have a relentless focus on execution.\u201d\nUnited under the brand promise of Life\u2019s Good, a variety of integrated brand activities, spanning marketing, ESG and CSR, will be initiated starting this year. The company will spread the values and philosophy that underpin Life\u2019s Good with the spirit of a brave optimist, while also infusing the brand with a youthful dynamism.

The LG SIGNATURE OLED T is a true technological marvel, combining a transparent 4K OLED screen and LG\u2019s wireless video and audio transmission technology to transform the screen experience in ways that have never been possible before. The OLED T unlocks a world of near-limitless potential, giving users the unprecedented freedom to meticulously curate their living spaces. This is complemented by the class-leading picture quality and performance of LG OLED, powered by the new \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor. A genuine game changer, LG\u2019s transparent OLED is the winner of five CES 2024 Innovation Awards, including a Best of Innovation honor.\nLG SIGNATURE OLED T liberates users from a dominant black screen that competes with the d\u00e9cor in their home. Maintaining its 77-inch screen size, OLED T and its innovative transparent display seamlessly harmonizes with its environment. Practically invisible when turned off, it blends into the environment and frees users from the long-standing problem of what to do with the \u2018big black screen.\u2019 The TV\u2019s beautiful see-through screen also helps to make one\u2019s space feel larger, providing a sense of openness.\nThe unique LG OLED T brings with it many new possibilities, from where it can be placed in the room, to the kinds of user experiences that LG can now deliver.\nIts transparent OLED screen removes the usual constraints that come with conventional TVs. No longer does the TV have to be placed against the wall. Instead, users can place the OLED T in the middle of the room to become a divider or prop it against the window without blocking the view outside. The included Zero Connect Box, which leverages LG\u2019s cutting-edge wireless transmission technology to send 4K images and sound to the OLED T, also enables users to place their TV anywhere, regardless of where the electrical outlets are located in the room. With no cables between the Zero Connect Box and the OLED T, users can enjoy a clean, cable-free viewing environment.\nWhat\u2019s more, the modular design of the LG OLED T facilitates diverse installation methods. The OLED T comes in stand-alone, against-the-wall or wall-mount options. Customers can further customize by adding standing or floating shelves on either or both sides of the screen to best suit their unique tastes and preferences.\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED lets owners discover new forms of entertainment and use via its dual viewing experiences: transparent and opaque. The OLED T becomes a transparent digital canvas for showcasing artwork, videos or photos with the Always-On-Display (AOD) feature. Content displayed on the transparent screen appears to float in air, yet simultaneously fuses with the surrounding space to create a compelling and atmospheric visual effect. Another option is the T-Bar feature that offers a helpful info-ticker running along the lower part of the screen. The T-Bar displays news alerts, weather updates or the title of songs being played while the rest of the screen presents a clear, unobstructed view of the space behind it.\nFor viewing in picture perfect OLED, simply click a button to raise the contrast screen. In this way, users can instantly switch to take full advantage of LG OLED\u2019s enhanced picture quality through the new \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor with 4-times greater AI performance. This provides a 70 percent improvement in graphic performance and a 30 percent faster processing speed compared to its predecessor. OLED T offers the best of both transparent and vibrant-color screen experiences with just a click of a button.\n\u201cAn incredible feat of consumer-driven innovation, LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers brand-new screen experiences plus the picture quality and performance of our award-winning OLED technology,\u201d said Park Hyoung-sei, president of the LG Home Entertainment Company. \u201cLG\u2019s transparent OLED gives customers greater freedom to curate their living spaces, completely redefining what\u2019s possible and pointing the way to an exciting future for the television industry.\u201d\nThe stunning LG SIGNATURE OLED T will be on show during CES 2024 from January 9-12 at the company\u2019s booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center).

Having gained a rich understanding of global consumers and their living spaces for close to seven decades, the company is now going beyond the home, expanding its business into diverse spaces including mobility, commercial and virtual. In every arena, the company aims to improve the customer experience by focusing on five key elements dubbed 3C2S: Care, Connectivity, Customization, Servitization and Sustainability.\nAI Redefined as \u2018Affectionate Intelligence\u2019\nIn its journey to innovate and elevate the customer experience, LG has identified AI as one of the most essential enablers of success. Rather than fixating on the evolution of the technology itself, LG is dedicated to demonstrating how AI can provide tangible benefits in the real world.\nThe company redefined AI as \u201cAffectionate Intelligence,\u201d revealing a belief that AI can foster a customer experience that is more caring, empathetic and attentive.\nReal-Time Life Intelligence\nDuring the press conference, CEO Cho highlighted the unique characteristics of LG\u2019s AI solutions, starting with its capacity to harness a wealth of data, in both scale and quality. Among the 500 to 700 million LG products currently in use worldwide, there are many smart devices equipped with AI-supported intelligent sensors that are optimized to learn and analyze users\u2019 \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019 life patterns.\nWhereas many companies rely on internet-based data to train their AI, LG has the advantage of being able to draw on \u2018real life\u2019 data gathered from billions of connected devices, encompassing LG smart products and a wide range of IoT devices. This dataset can provide valuable insight into customer-device interactions, as well as customers\u2019 environments, behavior patterns and emotional states.

Leveraging the company\u2019s vast repository of user data, the AI Brain forecasts customers\u2019 needs based on user-product interactions and contextual learning, performs advanced reasoning processes and generates optimal solutions through orchestrating the actions of physical devices.\nUltimately, this allows the company to provide intelligent services and experiences for the various spaces in customers\u2019 lives, all delivered in a more intelligent and efficient manner, showcasing the attentiveness embedded in LG\u2019s concept of Affectionate Intelligence.\nCommitment to Responsible Intelligence\nLG is acutely aware of its responsibility to employ AI in an ethical manner and is dedicated to being accountable for the impacts and consequences of its decisions and actions. The company aims to develop AI systems that benefit all users, promote safe behavior and ensure the security of all collected personal data.\nHighlighting this commitment is the company\u2019s robust data security system, LG Shield, designed to protect personal data and information at every stage of the process, from collection and storage to utilization. Dedicated to realizing Responsible Intelligence, LG aims to surpass required industry benchmarks for the implementation of AI.\nIn his concluding remarks at LG World Premiere, CEO Cho emphasized that LG\u2019s approach to AI is firmly rooted in the belief that customers should have full control. He also added, \u201cLife\u2019s Good. This is our solid and uncompromising promise that motivates us to create a better life for our customers, even in the age of AI.\u201d\nAt the event, CEO Cho was joined on stage by Jung Ki-hyun, vice president and head of LG\u2019s Platform Business Center, and Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG Vehicle component Solutions (VS) Company, who introduced AI-based innovative technologies and strategies.\nStarting with the home, vice president Jung presented a blueprint for LG\u2019s AI-based smart home. In line with the vision to transform into a smart life solution company, the company is incorporating LG\u2019s unique \u2018Affectionate Intelligence\u2019 technology into the ThinQ platform. Mr. Jung not only unveiled innovative new services, such as \u2018ChatThinQ,\u2019 a generative AI chatbot that enables natural conversations with customers, and \u20183D Home View,\u2019 a 3D visualization of the home for integrated control of spaces in an intuitive way, but also revealed plans to launch a new smart home hub.\nAnd, in mobility, the company shared its vision for cars as a \u2018living space on wheels\u2019 powered by software-defined vehicle (SDV) solutions. In line with this vision, Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG VS Company, introduced LG AlphaWare, the company\u2019s suite of software solutions for SDV. LG AlphaWare includes versatile software modules to enhance existing vehicle operating systems and to assist in building new platforms; operation solutions to help software developers throughout the SW development process from design to deployment; in-cabin entertainment solutions that enable high definition content viewing and high quality sound; and human-machine interface solutions that utilize AR/MR and AI technologies to provide an immersive in-vehicle experience.\nVisit LG\u2019s dedicated CES site (www.LG.com/CES2024) and the LG Global YouTube channel for more information on what the company has in store for CES 2024, and to keep up with all the latest news during the event (January 9-12).\n# # #\nLG Releases Preliminary Earnings for Fourth-Quarter 2023\nSEOUL, Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics Inc. (LG) today announced its preliminary earnings results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023.\nLG reported an annual consolidated revenue of KRW 84 trillion, marking the third consecutive year of achieving the highest annual revenue, and an annual operating profit of KRW 3.5 trillion. These figures demonstrate a resilient business performance, approaching the results observed during the prior period of pent-up demand, despite challenges posed by delayed demand recovery from the economic slowdown as well as heightened market competition.\nThe historic high in annual revenue can be attributed to the robust fundamentals of LG\u2019s core businesses and the growth experienced in B2B sectors. Notably, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of LG\u2019s revenue over the last three years stands at over 13 percent. Additionally, the annual operating profit demonstrated a solid performance, reaching levels comparable to the preceding year.\nLG\u2019s effective management performance in the face of a challenging external environment is particularly noteworthy, setting it apart within the industry. Strategic efforts to enhance the business portfolio, including the early identification of market turning points to drive high growth in B2B sectors, played a pivotal role. Business model innovation, such as diversifying from hardware-oriented businesses to platform-based service business, also contributed to maintaining stable profitability.\nIn the home appliance & air solution business, LG is expected to have achieved an annual revenue milestone of KRW 30 trillion. Strategic market approaches, such as expanding volume zone lineups while retaining premium leadership to address demand polarization, played a key role in this success. B2B expansion in areas like HVAC, components and built-in appliances further contributed to overall growth. Going forward, LG will concentrate efforts on strengthening core competencies in product and manufacturing competitiveness, while accelerating changes in business models, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) and subscriptions, to prepare for the future. The company will also accelerate efforts to evolving its smart home solutions, reflecting the value of \u201cZero Labor Home,\u201d by expanding the lineup of home appliances embedded with operating systems.\nThe vehicle component solutions business is anticipated to have exceeded KRW 10 trillion in annual revenue within a decade of its establishment, becoming one of LG\u2019s core businesses. The average operating rate of production facilities has surpassed 100 percent since last year, driving growth. Starting this year, LG will intensify efforts to secure capabilities in the evolving trend of software-defined vehicles while aiming for growth in volume. Leveraging differentiation technologies accumulated in home appliances and IT, the company plans to enhance in-vehicle experiences while accelerating the efficiency and synergy of the entire business, including EV components and headlamps.\nDespite challenges in key markets like Europe, the home entertainment business experienced meaningful growth in webOS content and services. This year, the expansion of the webOS ecosystem will extend beyond TVs to encompass smart monitors, in-vehicle infotainment and other areas, further broadening the business scope. From a product perspective, LG will significantly strengthen both the top-tier OLED lineup and the QNED lineup, following a dual-track strategy to lead the premium market.\nThe business solutions company is concentrating on the early commercialization of key areas such as EV charging and robotics. As a leader in LG\u2019s B2B business, the segment aims to accelerate the shift from supplying single products to integrating and providing adjacent solutions. With a significant proportion of new businesses within the organization, investments are prioritized for future preparations rather than short-term management performance.\nIt is important to note that these figures represent tentative consolidated earnings based on the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards and are provided as a service to investors before LG Electronics releases its final earnings results. The official announcement of confirmed results, including the net profit for the year 2023 and the management performance of each Company, is scheduled for later this month.\n# # #\nLG Accelerates Next-Generation Autonomous Driving and Infotainment Solution\nLG\u2019s Innovative In-Vehicle Infotainment Capabilities Combine With Magna\u2019s Cutting-\nEdge ADAS and AD Technologies in Companies\u2019 Latest Collaboration\nSEOUL, Jan. 4, 2023 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) will hold a private demonstration for major automakers at CES 2024, introducing a new cross domain platform integrating Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Automated Driving (AD) and In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) technologies.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: LG's Massive OLED TV Ditches Wires and Incorporates (What Else?) AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I\u2019ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I\u2019m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I\u2019m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don\u2019t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "LG AD Solutions\u2019 2024 Predictions: Advertisers Cut the Cord and Shift to CTV\nMore innovation from AI, the growing importance of live sports streaming and a big shift in ad dollars are among the predictions made by LG\u2019s Tony Marlow\nThe big trends for 2024 include a major shift of ad dollars to CTV and \u201cthe death of the dongle\u201d, according to LG Ads Solutions\u2019 CMO Tony Marlow. Here are a few of his predictions for the year ahead:\n\u201cIn 2024, we anticipate a significant and continued shift of advertising dollars from linear TV to Connected TV (CTV),\u201d Marlow said. \u201cThis change is part of the \"big shift\" observed over the past few years, driven by consumers spending more time viewing CTV content. Notably, the rise in popularity of free, ad-supported streaming services offers advertisers a prime opportunity to engage with consumers in their increasingly preferred medium. Moreover, the introduction of ad-supported streaming options on major platforms like Netflix and Disney+ has expanded the available inventory. This transition is expected to accelerate in 2024.\u201d\nIn the 2024 Presidential Election, CTV will emerge as a groundbreaking battleground for political advertising: \u201c2024 will mark a significant shift from traditional broadcast political advertising to more personalized, digital video platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cWith CTV's ability to target specific demographics, locations, and interests, political campaigns will leverage CTV\u2019s addressability to tailor their messages more precisely than ever before. This strategic move not only reflects the changing landscape of media consumption but also acknowledges that younger, tech-savvy voters are more likely to be influenced through digital streaming services. Consequently, CTV advertising will play a pivotal role in shaping political narratives, offering an unprecedented level of engagement and message customization in the realm of electoral politics.\u201d\nDeath of the Dongle: \u201cIn 2024, Smart TVs will continue to solidify their position as the dominant household device, largely due to their native CTV capabilities surpassing dongle-based solutions,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cThe increasing affordability and accessibility of Smart TVs have already led to 77% of US TV households owning one as of 2023. This trend is poised to accelerate as viewers more frequently update their TVs and increasingly prefer the seamless experience of using built-in streaming features. The convenience of accessing favorite streaming apps directly through the TV, without the clutter and complexity of external dongles, is a significant draw. Consequently, advertising strategies that rely on dongle-based CTV footprints may need urgent reevaluation, in light of the clear consumer shift towards native CTV functionalities in Smart TVs.\u201d\nImpact of the Writer\u2019s Strike: \u201cThe 2023 writers\u2019 strike drove viewers to delve into the extensive back catalog of existing content via streaming platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2024, it will be interesting to see how sticky these behaviors become. The strike has already sparked a resurgence in consumer interest in \u2018repeat content\u2019, and this trend may lead to persistent viewership habits. Even with the production of new content in the new year, there's a potential for a lasting shift towards viewers increasingly engaging with on-demand streaming services for their backlog of content.\"\nLive Sports Will Drive Viewership and Ad Spend: \u201c2024 will be a big year for advertising around sports,\u201d he said. \u201cThe summer Olympics, in addition to major tentpole events like March Madness and the Super Bowl, will be a hot commodity for advertisers looking to reach large audiences. And while linear sports viewership won't dissipate entirely in the new year, streaming will continue to capture more eyeballs. In turn, advertisers will quickly snap up relevant CTV inventory knowing that they can marry scale with creativity on how to best engage these audiences. With CTV\u2019s interactive format capabilities, these advertisers will see payoffs with increased audience engagement and outcomes.\u201d\nThe Future of TV is a Personalized, Lean-In Experience: \u201cThe future of television is shaping up to be an immersive canvas of personalized, interactive experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are entering an era where TV is not just a device for passive viewing, but a dynamic platform for engagement and interaction. Leveraging the power of data and AI, the industry is poised to transform television into an interactive experience, tailored to each viewer's unique preferences. This includes integrating cloud gaming directly into TVs, offering viewers the chance to play high-end games without additional hardware. Furthermore, shoppable experiences in CTV ads and content are emerging, allowing viewers to make purchases directly from their screens. On-demand content continues to evolve, offering a rich and diverse range of programming accessible at any time. With this seamless blend of engaging content, innovative advertising, and interactive features, the television revolution will not only captivate audiences but also provide advertisers with unprecedented precision and impact in connecting with their audiences.\"\nAI is set to generate innovation: \u201cWhile the conversation around AI in the industry has been rapidly evolving, its full potential and applications are still being explored,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2024, we anticipate a more pronounced impact of AI in the CTV space, especially in two key areas: targeting and creative. In targeting, the efficiency of AI will be paramount, enabling the creation of audience segments with a level of precision and speed that far exceeds traditional methods. This advanced segmentation will drive relevance and conversion, ushering in a new era of effectiveness and efficiency. On the creative front, AI offers a massive opportunity for testing and optimizing content. Marketers will be able to delve into a broader range of testing scenarios, moving well beyond the limits of traditional A/B testing by rapidly developing a large volume of AI-generated creative options. This approach allows for the fine-tuning of creatives to an unprecedented degree, ensuring maximum resonance with the target audience. At LG Ads, we're already capitalizing on this power, but by 2024, we expect its wider adoption across the industry, with other players leveraging AI to build and refine creative units at an unparalleled scale.\"\n\u201cThis trend marks a transformative period for the CTV industry, where AI is not merely an auxiliary tool but a central pillar in shaping the future of content and advertising,\u201d he concluded.\nGet the TV Tech Newsletter\nThe professional video industry's #1 source for news, trends and product and tech information.

Under the theme of \"Reinvent your future,\" LG's exhibition presents how the company will elevate customer experiences in everyday lives through its latest innovations \u2013 including the transparent and wireless 4K LG SIGNATURE OLED TV; a smart home powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies; and the mobility concept Alpha-able.\nThe Ultimate TV Experience With Innovative Technology and Infinite ContentThe heart of LG's booth is the world's first transparent and wireless 4K OLED TV, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T. Visitors are greeted by a massive media art display created by combining fifteen 77-inch OLED Ts, showcasing captivating video content with perfect black levels and vibrant colors. These displays gradually transform into a transparent OLED TV, revealing a new era uncovered by OLED T. The floating appearance of the OLED TVs emphasizes the wireless transmission of video and audio signals and connection to external devices, simplifying installation and providing more freedom in interior design.\nA dedicated zone highlights the LG SIGNATURE OLED T's transparent and wireless technology, which allows the TV to exceed the constraints of space and seamlessly blend into everyday life. Serving as a TV that complements the interior design of any space, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers an extension of future living experiences. Additionally, the transparent screen enhances the viewing experience of media artworks by adding depth and dimensionality.\nMoving on to the next zone, visitors encounter an impressive tunnel structure featuring over 140 55-inch OLED displays. This webOS experience Zone serves as a platform to showcase an extensive range of content, curated through collaborations with diverse partners. An invitation to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS platform, the webOS Zone treats guests to an extensive collection of video clips from a diverse range of genres, including highly anticipated series, games or sports. This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the 'Smart Life Solution' ExperienceIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company's AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people's lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers' words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers' heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend's presence, automatically asking whether to download the 'pet mode' on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers' daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG's Future Mobility ConceptGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \"personalized digital cave.\" To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG's mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG's unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers' needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG's EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG VisionLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company's experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG's home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its 'Universal UP Kit', a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG's latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

Under the theme of \"Reinvent your future,\" LG's exhibition presents how the company will elevate customer experiences in everyday lives through its latest innovations \u2013 including the transparent and wireless 4K LG SIGNATURE OLED TV; a smart home powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies; and the mobility concept Alpha-able.\nThe Ultimate TV Experience With Innovative Technology and Infinite ContentThe heart of LG's booth is the world's first transparent and wireless 4K OLED TV, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T. Visitors are greeted by a massive media art display created by combining fifteen 77-inch OLED Ts, showcasing captivating video content with perfect black levels and vibrant colors. These displays gradually transform into a transparent OLED TV, revealing a new era uncovered by OLED T. The floating appearance of the OLED TVs emphasizes the wireless transmission of video and audio signals and connection to external devices, simplifying installation and providing more freedom in interior design.\nA dedicated zone highlights the LG SIGNATURE OLED T's transparent and wireless technology, which allows the TV to exceed the constraints of space and seamlessly blend into everyday life. Serving as a TV that complements the interior design of any space, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers an extension of future living experiences. Additionally, the transparent screen enhances the viewing experience of media artworks by adding depth and dimensionality.\nMoving on to the next zone, visitors encounter an impressive tunnel structure featuring over 140 55-inch OLED displays. This webOS experience Zone serves as a platform to showcase an extensive range of content, curated through collaborations with diverse partners. An invitation to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS platform, the webOS Zone treats guests to an extensive collection of video clips from a diverse range of genres, including highly anticipated series, games or sports. This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the 'Smart Life Solution' ExperienceIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company's AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people's lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers' words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers' heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend's presence, automatically asking whether to download the 'pet mode' on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers' daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG's Future Mobility ConceptGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \"personalized digital cave.\" To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG's mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG's unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers' needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG's EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG VisionLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company's experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG's home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its 'Universal UP Kit', a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG's latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.
