Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Sign-in with:\nBosch Tackles EVs and Efficiency at CES 2024\nBosch demonstrated a variety of new initiatives for a sustainable future. EEPower reports from CES 2024 in this roundup of Bosch\u2019s innovations.\nEvery year, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) acts as the industry\u2019s launching pad for new technologies and next-generation concepts. Fortunately, CES 2024 was no exception, as many of the industry\u2019s biggest names, including Bosch, demonstrated the latest and greatest in consumer electronics.\nA particular focus of this year\u2019s show was sustainability, with the floor being dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and more efficient power solutions. Bosch used the opportunity to launch a variety of sustainability-focused initiatives, one of which won a CES Innovation Award.\nBosch and VW Team Up for Automated EV Parking\nBosch and Volkswagen subsidiary Cariad are collaborating in the testing of automated valet charging.\nBuilt upon Bosch's automated valet parking system, the solution allows EVs to autonomously navigate to an available parking space equipped with a charging spot. A charging robot then connects to the vehicle to begin charging. Once fully charged, the vehicle moves to a regular parking spot, making the charging spot available for other EVs.\nThis technology addresses common challenges EV drivers face, such as long queues at charging stations and the inconvenience of manual charging. Additionally, automated valet charging can potentially optimize the efficiency of charging infrastructure and parking space utilization by automating it through a robotic system.\nThe technology won a CES Innovation Award, and currently, testing trials are being conducted in Bosch's development parking garage in Ludwigsburg and Cariad's staff parking garage in Ingolstadt, Germany.\nBosch Tackles Efficiency\nBeyond automatic valets, Bosch used CES 2024 to showcase its commitment to sustainable energy use through a series of technological innovations focused on digitalization, electrification, and hydrogen.\nFirst, Bosch is making strides in the semiconductor industry by producing silicon carbide (SiC) chips for EVs, which are more efficient than traditional silicon chips. In fact, the company is investing $1.5 billion into a SiC wafer fab in California with the hopes of starting SiC production in the U.S. by 2026.\nNext, Bosch highlighted their new IDS Ultra Heat Pump for the home. Designed for North American climates, the fully electric pump provides 100% heating capacity down to 5\u00b0F. This was coupled with their demonstration of an electric storage water heater solution Bosch claims is up to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters.\nFurther, Bosch is investing heavily in hydrogen technologies, emphasizing its role in future mobility and energy efficiency. The company has already started volume production of mobile fuel cells and is developing components for a hydrogen engine, which promises nearly carbon-neutral operation when powered by green hydrogen. The company has invested $7 billion into hydrogen hubs to support this effort.\nAdvancing Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Solutions\nOverall, Bosch's presentations at CES 2024 highlight its dedication to advancing sustainable, efficient energy solutions across various sectors, including mobility, home appliances, and industrial technologies. Developments like these will be necessary to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nRelated Content\nLearn More About:\nYou May Also Like\nby Steve Roberts\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Lorenzo Mari\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nWelcome Back\nDon't have an EEPower account?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best EV and car tech of CES 2024: from Honda, BMW, Mercedes and more\nCES 2024 was big for EV and automative innovation\nCars are rapidly becoming an extension of our digital lives \u2013\u00a0and this week's CES 2024 showed how much the two will continue to intertwine this year and beyond.\nWhether it's accessing your calendar on the move or controlling your smart home kit with your voice, cars are increasingly becoming giant smartphones. Add a push towards alternative fuel sources, be it electricity or hydrogen, into the mix, and you can see why the Consumer Electronics Show is becoming a favorite spot for automakers to reveal their latest innovations.\nThis year saw just a handful of new vehicle concepts unveiled, chiefly Honda\u2019s re-writing of its own EV rulebook and Kia\u2019s push into commercial vehicles. But AI assistants and advanced infotainment offerings were arguably the show\u2019s core theme in 2024.\nLuckily for you, we sweatily shuffled over 40km in three days to get hands-on with the most important EV and in-car tech reveals of CES 2024...\n1. Honda resets the EV clock to zero\nHonda's journey towards electrification hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. But at CES 2024, the Japanese company said it wants to remedy that by going back to \"the starting point of Honda as an automaker\". Essentially, it is ripping up its own rulebook and starting afresh.\nThe result is two stunning concepts, the 0 Series Saloon and Space-hub, both offering a glimpse at Honda\u2019s overarching design direction and EV philosophy.\nGlobal CEO Toshihiro Mibe says his company wants to move away from the \"thick and heavy\" electric cars of today and instead focus on a \"thin, light and wise\" philosophy.\nCut through the non-speak and Honda is looking towards the next generation of thinner and lighter battery packs to power its sleek, low and rakish Saloon, which is tipped to be very close to a production version and is promised to inherit the marque\u2019s 'joy of driving' spirit.\nThere\u2019s no word on range and performance, as it\u2019s likely still hypothetical, but both the Saloon and the people moving, lounge-like Space-Hub will both feature advanced driver assist systems, high levels of autonomous driving capabilities and, fingers crossed, some cutting-edge infotainment thanks to Honda\u2019s close ties with multimedia and entertainment giant Sony.\n2. BMW showcases AR driving\nBMW hosted demos of an Xreal Air 2-based augmented reality experience aboard a BMW iX at CES 2024 \u2013\u00a0and TechRadar\u2019s US Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff said that what he saw \"surprised and often delighted\" him.\nThat\u2019s high praise indeed, but rather than merely being a fun gimmick (BMW made it rain AR casino betting chips on our cruise around Las Vegas), it could also be a very handy extension of the navigation and infotainment system in general.\nWith the Xreal Air 2 glasses on, BMW is able to project driver information onto the real world outside the windscreen, with strobing 3D green arrows highlighting upcoming turns, and large red blocks warning when the driver is getting dangerously close to static objects.\nCurrently, the system is running through a smartphone that is connected to the car, but developers behind the tech want to make the entire experience wireless, opening it up to other brands of augmented reality glasses to make the experience as seamless as possible for potential customers.\nBut the ultimate party piece? Flip down the front sun visor and the system becomes an impressively sharp\u00a0private cinema. Perfect for whiling away the hours when charging modern EVs on a cripplingly slow public charging network.\n3. Kia pushes into electric vans\nKia's interpretation of PBV stands for \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicles\u2019, rather than the more commonly used 'purpose built vehicles', but either way this is its break into the electric commercial vehicle market.\nThe upcoming line-up comprises the PV1, PV5 and PV7, which showcase a range of sizes and applications, and span ideas that are very close to production, as well as those that are little more future-thinking.\nThe mid-sized PV5 is our best indication of what Kia\u2019s electric van will look like and its highly modular interior can be configured for a range of scenarios, be it last mile delivery or transporting the family in a ride-hailing service.\nOne of its key USPs is its software defined nature, which allows it to pass data from a central control room to the vehicle and vice versa, making it simple for operators to manage an entire fleet in real time, without the need for additional technology.\nAs we look into the future-gazing crystal ball, we will see fully autonomous versions and what Kia is calling 'Easy Swap' technology, which allows a single vehicle chassis to house multiple upper bodies, effectively transforming it from a cargo carrier to mobile office (and beyond) in minutes thanks to hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling tech.\n4. Mercedes reinvents your driving playlist\nIt was the CES innovation I really wanted to hate, but ended up becoming slightly smitten with, as Mercedes-Benz effectively turned its electric vehicles into musical instruments.\nThanks to Will.i.am and his team of talented developers, the Mercedes-Benz MBUX Sound Drive app deconstructs your favourite tracks and uses information from the vehicle, such as steering inputs, acceleration and braking, to create intriguing, live performance style remixes.\nYou can read our full hands-on MBUX experience for more details, but a quick test of the technology proved it was less a gimmicky way to kill a few minutes, and more a clever way to uniquely soundtrack an audibly-bereft electric vehicle. Hey, I don\u2019t even like The Black Eyed Peas, but MBUX Sound Drive made me reconsider my position.\n5. Harman turns car seats into speakers\nDubbed SeatSonic, Harman\u2019s passenger-centric audio system completely rethinks the in-car listening experience, with one Harman executive going so far as saying it also \"frees car designers from today\u2019s interior constraints\".\nWe\u2019re not sure how much design real estate is actually behind a door card, but the idea is solid, as it sees near-field transducers integrated into the headrests and a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seats for a viscerally bassy experience.\nThe sound quality is great, although the basic package, where speakers are only installed in the seats, can sound a little dull and distant. To combat this, Harman will offer additional tweeters that nestle beneath the windscreen for a much richer listen.\nBetter still, Harman says that because the audio doesn\u2019t have to travel as far, there is a 60 per cent power saving when compared to a conventional in-car audio set-up. That stuff makes a big difference in today\u2019s world of electric vehicles and range anxiety.\nHarman has been working with seat makers, as well as Tier 1 suppliers that produce automotive grade ventilation, heating and massaging tech, to integrate it into one neat, ready to rock package. So expect to see it go live soon.\n6. Mobion banishes awkward parking situations\nStick with us here, as this one gets a little weird. But Hyundai Mobis, a subsidiary of automotive giant Hyundai, offered a glimpse of a future where tricky parking situations are no more. The Mobion concept car, which is just a jazzy Hyundai Ioniq 5, features the company\u2019s In-Wheel motor technology and upcoming e-Corner drive system.\nHere, all four wheels are driven and can steer independently of one another. Motors in the wheels mean no axles, which frees up each corner to do as it pleases. Well, within reason.\nA live demonstration showed how Mobion can \u2018crab-walk\u2019, where all four wheels rotate 90-degrees and the car effectively performs a sideways scuttle into tough parallel parking spots. The system can move the car diagonally, back and forth, as well as see it rotate a full 360 degrees around its centre axis \u2013 it puts our U-turns to shame.\nNaturally, everything is overseen by Lidar, radar and high-definition cameras, which allows most manoeuvers to be performed autonomously, while exterior projection lighting allows the car to project safety information around it as it performs its party tricks \u2013 seemingly so pedestrians don\u2019t completely freak out.\nThe In-Wheel motor and e-Corner system are \"ready for immediate mass production,\" according to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. The company just needs to find a suitable Hyundai or Kia product to place it in.\n7. Mullen goes supersonic with its 1,000bhp Five RS\nCalifornian EV maker Mullen took the wraps off potentially one of the most aggressive and utterly banzai electric SUVs were have ever laid eyes on. The performance figures hurt just to look at: 1,000bhp, 0-60mph in under two seconds and a top speed in excess of 200mph.\nAll that, and Mullen says it will feature a two-speed transmission, an 800V electrical architecture for faster charging and offer over 300 miles of real-world range. Race-derived Brembo braking products, bucket seats, and an overtly aggressive stance all come as standard.\nBut because this is a modern EV, it also features an enormous dual screen infotainment set-up that is reported to come complete with a built-in voice assistant.\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Five RS is slated to go on sale in Europe in 2025, with a US version following in 2027. Prices are due to start at an eye-watering $295,000 / \u00a3231,000 / \u20ac268,000 / AUS$441,000.\n8. Hyundai takes to the skies\nIn a purpose-built 'vertiport' outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Hyundai\u2019s Supernal S-A2, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) craft that is set to begin testing next year. Designed by Hyundai\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke, the man behind the stunning N Vision 74 (and many others), it takes styling inspiration from the eyes of a bee and features a highly configurable, premium interior that can seat up to four passengers.\nUsing eight tilting rotors, it can fly at speeds of up to 120mph, while the on-board high density battery packs are good for trips ranging from 25 to 40 miles \u2013 although that will increase. The idea is that the craft operates at 1,500ft, way below commercial aircraft, and offers short hops between inner city \u2018vertiports\u2019 using an Uber-style ride hailing platform.\nHead of the project and ex-NASA man Jaiwon Shin, says quietness is key, stating that the S-A2 emits just 65db during take-off and around 45db during cruise, which he says his less than a domestic dishwasher. He wants to avoid people \"looking up\" when it is in operation and hopes it will \"blend into inner-city traffic noise\".\nThe eVTOL craft has 'upgrade-ability' baked into it, meaning the S-A2 is ready to accept the next generation of battery technology. Supernal says it is moving beyond an early technology demonstrator and will begin testing the S-A2 you see before you in 2025.\n9. XPeng reveals pre-order plan for its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nIf XPeng is the Chinese manufacturer of impressive and altogether highly competitive electric cars, XPeng AeroHT is its slightly bonkers, future-thinking little brother. A sibling that comes up with flying car concepts and six-wheeled off-road MPVs that come complete with a human piloted electric 'Air Module' in the back.\n\"I like flying, I have a helicopter, but I can\u2019t take the helicopter where I want. If I have this car, I can drive to where I want, park up and go flying,\" XPeng AeroHT\u2019s co-founder and vice president, Tan Wang told me at CES this year. \"The car is for customers that like to go off-road, but the performance on the road is way better, because it has three motors, one on each axle\" he added.\nIn addition to this, Wang claims the Air Module is much simpler to operate than a standard helicopter, as it blends human piloting skills with advanced levels of autonomy. Because of this, Wang feels it will require much fewer than 40 flying hours to obtain a helicopter license to legally be able to operate the eVTOL craft.\nWang also went on record to say the company was accepting pre-orders as of the end of this year, and that he hoped to have product in the air by the end of 2025. Both the six-wheeled vehicle and the aircraft can be yours for $200,000 /\u00a3157,000 /\u20ac182,000 / AUS$298,000, which feels like a bit of a bargain to us.\nHowever, Wang also pointed out that his company was \"still in the process\" of obtaining certification from the Chinese Aviation Authority, but he was hopeful it would happen soon.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest\u00a0CES news\u00a0from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Suche\nCES 2024: Bosch technologies help consumers\nuse energy sustainably\nTim Wieland\n>\nLas Vegas, NV, USA \u2013 Whether on the road or in the home, Bosch is driving forward the electrification of its technologies and solutions for sustainable energy use, and sees hydrogen as a key to meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in a climate-neutral way. At the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company is presenting technology and applications that can not only make life easier, safer, and more convenient, but also more sustainable \u2013 all for the good of our planet. Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year . Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption. In view of climate change, this is a major challenge.\n\u201cTo help us meet our future global energy needs in a more resource-efficient way, we at Bosch are rethinking energy use and focusing on a two-pronged approach: electrification and hydrogen. For a low-emissions future, we are optimizing the use of traditional energy sources by driving forward electrification in mobility, commercial buildings, and homes. And we are tapping into new, sustainable energy sources \u2013 with hydrogen playing a central role,\u201d said Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nMore efficient electrification thanks to innovative Bosch technologies\nElectrification is already well advanced, particularly in the mobility sector. Bosch is a leading supplier along the entire electromobility value chain \u2013 from chips,\ne-axles, and electric motors to battery technology, charging stations, and numerous services. One innovation the company is presenting at CES has been named a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA): automated valet charging. In a parking garage equipped with an automated valet parking system (automated valet parking), electric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car. \u201cThe unique combination of automated valet charging and automated valet parking makes Bosch a pioneer on the market,\u201d R\u00fcckert said, adding: \u201cEvery step toward greater convenience in electromobility increases not only its attractiveness but also its acceptance.\u201d\nThis is another reason why Bosch is focusing on the innovative semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC), a key component for electrified mobility. The ramp-up of electromobility worldwide is leading to enormous demand for these special semiconductors. Using highly complex processes it developed itself, Bosch has been producing SiC chips at its wafer fab in Reutlingen, Germany, since 2021, and is currently investing more than 1.5 billion dollars in a further wafer fab in Roseville, California. This move will strengthen the company\u2019s international semiconductor manufacturing network. The aim is to start production of the first SiC chips in the U.S. by 2026, and in doing so increase the company\u2019s output tenfold in the years ahead. In electric cars, SiC chips extend driving range and make charging more efficient, as their energy losses are up to 50 percent lower. They also enable the car to travel further on a single battery charge \u2013 on average, range is up to 6 percent greater than with silicon-based chips.\nHeat pumps optimize energy consumption in homes\nAnother Bosch highlight at CES 2024 is the IDS Ultra Heat Pump, which was developed specifically for North America. Unlike conventional models, this heat pump provides 100 percent heating capacity down to outdoor temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius), and it\u2019s operational down to as low as minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 25 degrees Celsius). This is a particularly attractive option for people in colder climates in the U.S. or Canada looking to switch from fossil fuel-based heating systems to electrified alternatives. Such a switch saves not only energy but also costs: Bosch heat pumps are three to five times more energy efficient than gas furnaces and consume only about half as much electricity as electric furnaces. Bosch has also succeeded in applying heat-pump technology to a different area: in Las Vegas, the company is presenting its most efficient water heater to date, which is a hybrid of an electric storage water heater and a heat pump that is three to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters in the market. \u201cWith solutions like this, we are paving the way to an electrified home \u2013 and helping save costs and energy,\u201d says Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America.\nVarious new features in Bosch home appliances such as ovens, dryers, and washing machines are also playing their part in this transition. For some time now, it has been common for users to set the start time for their appliance using a timer function. Bosch is now going one step further and equipping its latest generation of dishwashers with its \u201cMySchedule\u201d function for the first time. This can automatically schedule the start of the wash cycle to coincide with the periods when either the electricity price is lowest or green electricity is available. Good news for professional power tool users, too: at CES 2024, Bosch has announced further new partners for its AMPShare power tool battery platform \u2013 more than 30 global partners are now on board. Bosch AMPShare is a cross-brand battery system that allows trade and industry professionals to switch flexibly between different brands of professional tools without having to exchange the battery.\nBosch is actively promoting hydrogen as a pillar of future mobility\nIn addition to electrification, Bosch sees hydrogen as a key to meeting global energy demand in a resource-efficient way. As a storage medium, moreover, hydrogen can facilitate the efficient use of energy generated from renewable sources. Bosch is investing extensively in technologies along the hydrogen value chain. The focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year. Countries and industries around the world are investing in hydrogen technologies. The U.S. government, for example, is pushing ahead with the development of H2 infrastructure and investing 7 billion dollars in the construction of hydrogen hubs. \u201cThe H2 hubs are an important building block for establishing a hydrogen infrastructure. We at Bosch support these measures and are exploring participation in several of these hubs. Our goal is to help drive forward the clean-energy economy in North America. This is an area where we can contribute our expertise in the production and provisioning of hydrogen,\u201d Mansuetti says.\nSoftware paves the way for greater convenience and energy efficiency\nAcross all its divisions, Bosch is focusing on the use of software and digitalization. The company now has more than 44,000 associates working in software development, and it sees itself as leading the way to software-defined mobility. In Las Vegas, Bosch is presenting new products and solutions together with its strategic partner Amazon Web Services. These include a connected, fully automatic espresso machine, which will also be possible to control from the car using voice assistance such as Alexa, and a point-of-interest assistant, which uses an interior camera in the vehicle to recognize which restaurant or caf\u00e9 the driver is looking at based on their eye movements. The voice assistance then informs the driver in real time and completely automatically whether the restaurant is open and has a free table available.\nBosch is also presenting two new mobility services at the electronics trade fair: Usage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service. The first is an addition to Bosch\u2019s already established Battery in the Cloud services. The feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns. Both innovations aim to extend the service life of vehicles and conserve resources. Bosch is taking a similar approach in the building sector: The company offers digital services to achieve efficiency gains, such as the \"Nexospace Energy Manager\" for the European market. This helps customers to analyze their energy supply and usage and develop specific measures to optimize and reduce consumption. This was the case with the international supermarket chain REWE, for example, which was able to reduce consumption by up to 20 percent in more than 2,000 stores with the help of the \u201cNexospace Energy Manager\u201d. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, Bosch services can help save considerable amounts of CO2 by increasing efficiency. Decarbonize Industries, an AI-supported software-based service developed by Bosch together with a partner, helps manufacturing companies reduce their carbon footprint and also achieve significant cost savings.\nAutomated Valet Charging\nManufacturing of the Fuel Cell Power Module (FCPM) in the Feuerbach plant\nPower semiconductors from Bosch\nMySchedule App 800 Home Connect\nAutomated Valet Charging\nKey Visual Leit-PI\nBosch's cold climate heat pump IDS Ultra\nAutomated Valet Charging\nManufacturing of the Fuel Cell Power Module (FCPM) in the Feuerbach plant\nPower semiconductors from Bosch\nMySchedule App 800 Home Connect\nAutomated Valet Charging\nKey Visual Leit-PI\nBosch's cold climate heat pump IDS Ultra\nBosch at CES 2024:\n\u2022 PRESS CONFERENCE: Monday, January 8, 2024, from 9:00 to 9:45 a.m. (PST) with Dr. Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of\nRobert Bosch GmbH, and Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America, in Ballroom Banyan ABCD, Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,\nSouth Convention Center, Level 3, as well as livestreamed on the Bosch Media Service.\n\u2022 BOOTH: January 9 \u2013 12, 2024, in the Central Hall, booth #17207.\n\u2022 FOLLOW the Bosch CES 2024 highlights on X: #BoschCES.\n\u2022 PANELS WITH BOSCH EXPERTS, Thursday, January 11, 2024:\n\u201cElevate Your Space: Enhancing your Home with Smart Appliances\u201d, 15:00 p.m. (local time), Venetian Hotel, Lando 4302, session with\nGoncalo Costa, Vice President of Climate and Wellbeing North America.\n\u201cOur Newest Cyber Threat is AI and AI is Our Biggest Defense\u201d,\n14:00 p.m. (local time), Las Vegas Convention Center West / N258,\nsession with Dr. Zico Kolter, Chief Scientist of AI at Bosch.\n\u201cFuture of Care: How Other Industries Shape Health\u201d, 11:00 a.m.\n(local time), Las Vegas Convention Center / North Wing, session with\nDr. Stefan Finkbeiner, General Manager at Bosch Sensortec.\nTags:\nSustainability\nContact persons for press inquiries:\nBosch at CES:\nIrina Ananyeva: +49 152 597-53284\nTim Wieland: +1 248 410-0288\nTrix B\u00f6hne: +49 173 523-9774\nConnected mobility, software: Athanassios Kaliudis: +49 152 086-51292\nSmart living: D\u00f6rthe Warnk: +49 172 153-8714\nHydrogen: Anna Schmatz: +49 173 409-7533\nAutomated mobility: Jennifer Gass: +49 152 346-63461\nSustainability: Inga Ehret:, +49 172 324-2636\nX: @BoschPress\nHaving established a regional presence in 1906 in North America, the Bosch Group employs 34,700 associates in more than 100 locations, as of December 31, 2020.

It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The monitor has dual 10-watt speakers for audio, as well as AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium to reduce screen tearing or distortion. It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

        "raw_content": "The 8 Coolest EV Innovations Announced at CES 2024\nGaming, #vanlife, and mixed reality are all coming to an EV near you.\nCES is, by definition, future-forward. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest gathering of gadget geeks, and carmakers have used the show for well over a decade to peacock about their own tech wares and creativity, partnerships, and design acumen.\nAnd if CES 2024 is defined by any single tech component, it\u2019s not the motors and batteries that are moving the latest and greatest EV concepts, it\u2019s the sheer computational \u201chorsepower\u201d allowing these vehicles to become four-wheeled gaming computers, AI assistants, and mixed reality machines.\nAnd more than at any CES we can recall, carmakers really wanted to name-drop their alliance with tech companies bigger (at least in terms of stock value) than themselves. So you had the likes of Mercedes, the Sony-Honda collab known as SHM, BMW, and Volkswagen all boasting about various tie-ins with powerhouse brands including Meta, Amazon, and even Opean AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nThere was physical substance, too, luckily, including possibly far more affordable EVs \u2014 and, of course, a flying car because they probably aren\u2019t allowed to call it CES without one. Here\u2019s the rundown of the latest and greatest EV innovations shown off at the tech show.\n1. Honda Space-Hub and Saloon Concepts\nThe Saloon (pictured) brings a high-tech electric shaver vibe to the table.\nHonda was busy at CES, both debuting these two concepts and a tech tour-de-force in its partnership with Sony called the Afeela. The Space-Hub and Saloon EV concepts are part of an entirely new platform for 2026, called Zero Series, with in-house battery and construction techniques. While Honda didn\u2019t provide specific details, the company says its new battery platform will be more power-dense than the GM Ultium batteries inside of the Prologue electric SUV that\u2019s coming out later this year.\nAs for tech, Honda says Zero Series EVs will feature more advanced driver assistance that could better take over some driving duties in urban and highway environments. Honda also says it\u2019s yielding some understanding of posture and comfort from its robotics division, likely meaning a more active seat that responds to g-forces, for instance, and possibly suspension that\u2019s more active in response to physical road conditions.\n2. Vinfast Wild Pickup Concept and eSUV VF3\nVinfast is intent on bringing it\u2019s small electric pickup to the American market.\nWe\u2019ve been eying cheap Chinese electric cars with envy for a little while now. But with tariffs blocking those imports, Vietnam\u2019s Vinfast may turn out to be the \u201chack\u201d for Americans who want in on the EV transformation but aren\u2019t willing (or able) to spend $60,000 for their piece of the dream. The company dropped two intriguing options that may come here. There\u2019s the Wild Pickup Concept, a mid-size EV truck about the size of a Ford Ranger with a clever \u201cmid-gate\u201d that opens up between the five-foot bed and the rear of the cabin wall, expanding hauling capacity to eight feet. This is also a smallish and lower truck than the towering norm, and with a four-seat cabin and a relatively compact size, may make for the ideal urban pickup that sadly left the U.S. market ages ago.\nThen there\u2019s the tiny VF3, a square-bodied micro-ute that\u2019s two feet shorter than a Mini Cooper two-door. The second-row seats do fold flat and yield about 20 square feet of cargo room, which is larger than most sedan trunks. Vinfast is billing the VF3 as a city runabout with about 125 miles of EV range, and if the price is cheap enough, you could imagine it as the ideal second car that\u2019s all about errand running. The hurdle, still, is finding convenient charging for apartment dwellers, etc., but there\u2019s a fine argument to be made that you don\u2019t need massive charging capacity or super high-speed powering if you\u2019re not juicing a big battery.\n3. Sony Afeela\nSony showcased more of the Afeela this year, making a splash by driving the EV on stage with a PlayStation Controller.\nWe\u2019ve been wondering for a while why exactly Sony and Honda (jointly called SHM) are co-developing an EV, but this is now becoming a lot less cloudy. The Afeela, which debuted last year at CES, is now maturing in pretty awesome ways. This time, Sony hyped in-car gaming (on rear screens) and used Fortnite as an illustration \u2014 the Afeela, which won\u2019t be on U.S. roads until 2026, will also soon debut on Gran Turismo 7. So, ahem, virtual car debuts ahead of the actual car? Yes. And then just think: Come 2026, rear-seat passengers could game in such a ride while you drive it! Speaking of the real and virtual merging, SHM is adding AR in unique ways, too, saying that the Afeela will gamify some of what you\u2019d see in the heads-up and in-dash environment, with not just navigational graphics imposed, but playful ones, too. SHM says it\u2019ll create live 3D mapping overlaid on the actual visual environment, and all this will be powered by Unreal Engine 5.3, with over-the-air updates.\nSHM also wants to use the Afeela as a development platform, allowing creators to make interactive features and apps as they would for phones, and also to allow owners to customize screensaver and even sounds both inside and outside the vehicle. For instance, on the screen \u2014 located at the nose of the car \u2014 you could put cheeky slogans or display a snap of your latest tattoo. Further, SHM is partnering with Microsoft on a virtual assistant (sorry, \u201cconversational personal agent\u201d) for the Afeela. All this feels mighty ambitious, but at the same time, long past due. Carmakers haven\u2019t really gone as deep as possible on in-vehicle tech, and who better than Sony to pull this off?\n4. BMW Integrated Gaming Controllers\nSony and Tesla don\u2019t get to have all the fun when it comes to in-car gaming.\nYou may have read on Inverse how much tech BMW is packing into its EVs, but the German carmaker is now upping the ante. BMW\u2019s new OS 9 includes a wireless Bluetooth controller that lets you and other seatmates game while parked and recharging. BMW also says its new streaming capabilities (via a partnership with Tivo) will surface content timed with how long you\u2019ll be charging. Presumably, you could still binge TikTok, or you could let your German sled surface videos that will end just a minute before your car has re-juiced.\nMore interesting, especially for drivers, BMW is touting its partnership with Meta around the use of XR (mixed reality) glasses, where the carmaker says donning such headgear could offer more enhanced information and safety features than a heads-up display alone. But if you\u2019ve used AR in a non-moving space and gotten a little queasy, we have our concerns about what this will be like IRL at 60 mph.\n5. Volkswagen and ChatGPT\nChatGPT is winding up everywhere, including VW\u2019s Ida voice assistant.\nVolkswagen is bringing artificial intelligence to its cars using ChatGPT voice integration. It\u2019s dubbed the assistant \u201cIda\u201d and the idea is that you say \u201cHey, Ida,\u201d to then converse with the system, which debuts on cars in the second half of 2024. Ida was announced for the new ID.7 sedan, which goes on sale later this year in the U.S., and for the ID.4, which is already on sale here. However, the fine print says the AI is being \u201cconsidered\u201d for the U.S. and will be in cars sold elsewhere. Also, no word yet on the ID. Buzz van or the next GTI or other cars sold here.\nThe advantage, maybe, is that current voice control in cars is pretty limited. You can issue a very direct prompt, like \u201cset the temperature to 70 degrees\u201d but you can\u2019t ask (or receive) much detail via voice, like \u201cwho are the other artists on this album I\u2019m streaming?\u201d To date, a lot of assisting consists of asking for something, repeating yourself, and trying to rephrase a question to have the input understood. It\u2019s possible much of this is better tackled by AI like ChatGPT, especially since so much of what the tech has been trained for is to recognize the way we speak. The asterisk: Volkswagen was quick to point out that \u201cChatGPT does not gain any access to vehicle data; questions and answers are deleted immediately to ensure the highest possible level of data protection.\u201d No promises that it won\u2019t make up answers, however.\n6. Mercedes-Benz, Amazon Music, Audible, and Dolby Atmos\nMercedes-Benz and Amazon are joining forces to offer Audible integrations.\nMercedes was one of the first brands to stretch a curved TFT entirely across the dash (dubbed a \u201cHyperscreen\u201d). Now it\u2019s promising to populate that display, and others, with content via a partnership with Amazon, Audible, and other services. First, the audio quality will be \u201cmulti-dimensional\u201d according to info from the Stuttgart-based carmaker, because the content will be deliverable via Dolby Atmos \u2014 provided your Benz has one of the brand\u2019s optional Burmester 4D or 3D Surround Sound Systems.\nThat Dolby piece is part of the Amazon collaboration, where all the audio streamed to the car will be mixed according to the Atmos protocol. This includes both podcasts and music, with over-the-air updates coming later in 2024, though customers need both Audible and Amazon Music accounts. Ah, but the display part? You\u2019ll also be able to game in your Mercedes, thanks to a partnership with a company called Antstream Arcade, which includes vintage titles from Nintendo, Sega, and Atari, and you can watch film and TV via Sony Pictures Entertainment. If you live in California or Nevada, where Mercedes-Benz now enables Level 3 autonomous driving on certain highways, you can even game or watch movies while behind the wheel.\n7. Kia Customizable Vans\nKia\u2019s modular electric vans are many cars in one.\nYou\u2019d be smart to question why Mercedes is bringing an electric Sprinter to the U.S. later this spring, why you can now buy the same Rivian van that Amazon\u2019s using, and why Walmart is investing in vans from a brand called Canoo. Oh, also, later this year Volkswagen\u2019s reborn Microbus hits U.S. shores as the ID. Buzz. What\u2019s with all these electric vans? Table that: Know that now KIA has announced a modular van setup called the Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), capable of transformation into no less than five versions. The first to be sold will be the Kia PV5, but the theory behind the modularity is that the current owner \u2014 or the next one after a sale \u2014 could transform their PBV from a cargo van into a passenger one, or into a taxi cab or people hauler, such as an airport shuttle. In theory, too, PBVs could be updated for fully autonomous capability, such as a Waymo taxi.\nThere\u2019s even the capability to make this transformation on the fly, and you can imagine using your PBV as a work van during the week and then magic-ing it into a \u201ctoy hauler\u201d ski/camp/bike rig during days off. Yes, you\u2019d own two shells and KIA says the transfer would be feasible by the owner using \u201celectromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology.\u201d Yes, this makes more sense than owning two cars, and KIA also suggests a sort of \u201ctiny home\u201d functionality for the largest of the PBVs, where the steering wheel folds away and converts into a desk. As for why Kia and all these other brands are making electric vans, note how our consumer culture has shifted from shopping to online delivery. And likewise, we have a housing affordability crisis not just here but worldwide. If cars can be converted into extra rooms, that\u2019s a partial solution.\n8. Hyundai Supernal \u201cFlying Car\u201d\nWhat\u2019s CES without an eVTOL\nComing in 2028, the flying car! Maybe. And not really. This is an airplane with vertical takeoff and landing capability, so it\u2019s more like a merger of a plane and helicopter, not a flying car. FYI, Hyundai showed something like this at CES back in 2020, so it\u2019s not new to the carmaker. This latest iteration, the S-A2 eVTOL four-seater, features vertical takeoff and landing, seating for four, and supposedly autonomous flying in the future.\nIt\u2019s being built by Supernal, a division of Hyundai, and it features some pretty great tech \u2014 in theory. First, it\u2019s an EV, which is kind of amazing, and would have a range of about 40 miles. Most helicopter flights are actually super short \u2014 just hops from a city center to an airport, which, as the autonomous plane flies, is only about 10 miles. It\u2019s also supposed to be half as loud as the typical fossil-fuel copter, and its landing gear fully integrates into the body, which is one way to cut noise in flight (and increase range). Honda makes regional jets, FYI, so why can\u2019t Hyundai make electric helicopters?\nINVERSE brings you everything from the fun and futuristic world of consumer technology at CES 2024.

Expect Porsche\u2019s second EV, built from the ground up for the new powertrain, to have the pace you\u2019d expect from the brand with a two-motor setup delivering up to 603 bhp, while the 100-kWh battery should be good for at least 310 miles of range.

We\u2019ll have to see whether the many development quality issues have been fixed, of course\u2014but, thankfully, as it\u2019s been handed to (very few select) customers, we won\u2019t have to yet again include the truck in our yearly guide.\nIn the meantime, Tesla has other issues to consider, such as recalling nearly all the EVs it\u2019s sold in the US so far to fix an Autopilot fault, while also fending off Chinese brands. China\u2019s BYD Auto has caught up with Tesla in sales volume, and is soon predicted to surpass it to lead globally, even if the growth in worldwide sales is slowing.\nThe pace at which traditional automakers are making all-electric vehicles is only increasing, and the sheer volume of EVs landing in 2024 shows this. We\u2019re hoping that these future designs and car designers will take the inherent opportunities in electric architecture to trend toward being less macho and more inclusive.\nHere\u2019s our comprehensive guide on what to watch out for in the world of EVs in 2024.\nKia\u2019s EV3 electric compact SUV debuted as a concept last year and will arrive for real in 2024. Kia\u2019s looking to produce something practical and \u201cjoyful to drive,\u201d and unsurprisingly it resembles a cut-down EV9 seen in last year\u2019s picks. Kia plans to introduce a number of smaller EVs like the EV3, with prices ranging from $35,000 to $50,000. The windscreen on the EV3 is pushed forward, while those robust squared wheel arches, cut with asymmetrical angles, mirror the EV9. A disconnected C pillar gives the roof a floating effect. The inside should be appointed with environmentally friendly materials, and feature mini tables that rotate in length, position, and angle. The bench-type rear seat can be folded upward to store bulky items such as electric scooters and bicycles.\nIt\u2019s no secret we\u2019re fans of the recent design direction at Hyundai, and we also approved of the 2021 \u201coriginal\u201d Ioniq 5. But there were certain elements of the 5 (the pointy middle of the front bumper and the flared wheel arches, to name two) that might not age as well as one might think. It\u2019s gratifying that this refresh, landing in 2024 and dubbed the Ioniq 5 N, softens those initial design enthusiasms. Then there\u2019s the performance upgrade: Torque and power are up to 478 kW/650 PS when you press the N Grin Boost button, and drift tech helps you maintain slide angles if you like going sideways. Other flourishes include bucket seats that are positioned 20 mm lower compared to the basic spec, a lip spoiler running across the lower part of the front bumper, and a rear diffuser with \u201ceye-catching\u201d luminous orange accents.\nNow that Kia\u2019s EV9 is here, the next large eSUV from the Hyundai Motor Group will be the Ioniq 7, and it\u2019s been spotted in the testing phase in the wild ahead of its debut in 2024. Expect built-in autonomous driving technology and a good range. The interior will likely take notes from the excellent Ioniq 6. The side profile of the Ioniq 7 shows its windscreen is steeply raked and a sloping roofline at the rear, unlike the boxy Kia EV9\u2014and both are based on the same E-GMP platform. In the UK, the EV9 has a 99.8-kWh battery running either a single 201-bhp motor or 379-bhp dual-motor. The EV9 is supposedly capable of nearly 350 miles on a single charge, so expect similar of the Ioniq 7. It will also have the excellent 800-volt charging system, allowing a 10 to 80 percent charge in under 25 minutes.\nLauren Goode\nRyan Waniata\nMatt Jancer\nMedea Giordano\nThe Ioniq 7 is expected to be one of the last models to use the Hyundai Group\u2019s E-GMP platform. In 2025 we\u2019ll see the first vehicles based on its next-gen EV platforms: eM and eS. The eM will apparently allow for a 50 percent improvement in range on a single charge, as well as supporting Level 3 autonomous driving or higher. It will also employ the group's \u201cIntegrated Modular Architecture,\u201d standardizing key components like battery and motors. The eS is an EV platform for commercial Purpose Built Vehicles like those used for ride pooling, cargo hauling, and deliveries.\nLand Rover has taken its time getting there, but the full electric Range Rover has finally been slated for production in 2024. On-road testing has already begun in all sorts of conditions including \u201340 degrees Celsius in Sweden and 50 degrees Celsius in Dubai, so you can be assured that the company is not taking any chances with its 50-plus-year history conquering anything off-road. Much like the current Kias and Hyundais, the full-electric Range Rover will have an 800-volt architecture for rapid charging. Expect a hefty range, too, approaching 400 miles. Not only will it be whisper-quiet thanks to the electric powertrain, an active noise cancellation system has also been confirmed. For those who can\u2019t wait for the reviews, preorders are open now.\nAfter a half-year delay due to battery issues, the Explorer crossover will land in the summer of 2024. It uses Volkswagen\u2019s MEB platform (seen in all the ID. models) and will likely feature the same battery and motor options, so 52-kWh or 77-kWh numbers good for up to 335 miles, and between 201 and 335 bhp. Designed in America, but built at the new Ford Cologne EV Center in Germany, for now this EV is EU-only, but, if it proves popular, who knows? There will be two- and all-wheel drive versions, with 10 to 80 percent fast charging in just 25 minutes. The interior is a particular win, too, with a soundbar that runs the width of the dash.\nThe Polestar 4 is an SUV coup\u00e9 with a difference. Look at the rear end and you\u2019ll see why\u2014Polestar has got rid of the rear window entirely. The most powerful dual-motor 4 will run a 102-kWh battery for a claimed range of 350 miles (using the WLTP standard of measurement), and so is the most high-performance Polestar to date. The long-range single motor car has 272 bhp and a claimed range of 372 miles (WLTP). Bidirectional charging is included, and there is vehicle-to-load capability so you can use the car's battery to power small appliances. Instead of the rear glass, the brand is leaning on the capabilities of the high-definition screen that replaces the age-old rear-view mirror. A real-time feed from a roof-mounted rear camera supposedly delivers a broader field of vision. This tech isn\u2019t new\u2014Range Rover has been using its ClearSight camera mirror for years\u2014but Polestar is the first to go all in on the design potential. The reason? Better aerodynamic properties: The 4 has a slippery 0.26 drag coefficient.\nIt\u2019s been quite the wait since the 2019 Taycan, but finally the all-electric Macan comes into view in 2024. (We'll all have to wait a little longer for the planned pure-electric 718 Boxster and Cayman, though.) Expect Porsche\u2019s second EV, built from the ground up for the new powertrain, to have the pace you\u2019d expect from the brand with a two-motor setup delivering up to 603 bhp, while the 100-kWh battery should be good for at least 310 miles of range. The interior has a main 12.3-inch touchscreen that runs a new Porsche UI with supposedly better integration of electric drive features, such as intelligent routing and live updates of public fast-charging points.\nAudi\u2019s new eSUV, which sits between the smaller Q4 e-tron and larger Q8 e-tron, features a next-gen EV platform called the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE, that it shares with Porsche, and which will also be used on the above Macan EV. It has an 800-volt architecture much like the existing Kias and Hyundais, boasts new electric motors, and is powered by a 93.0-kWh battery that employs prismatic lithium-ion cells to give the battery more energy density. The rear motor is the main powerhouse, with the front unit called on for acceleration and traction, and both combined will supposedly deliver a zero-to-60 time of under six seconds for the Q6 (and 4.5 for the SQ6). We\u2019re hoping the prototype\u2019s headlamp tech, which can project both text and videos, makes it into production. Fingers crossed.\n\u201cYour three-wheeled chariot awaits,\u201d is the tagline of this nimble two-seater urban EV. The sub-$10,000 vehicle coming in 2024 not only looks like it\u2019s fun to drive, but has stats that are mighty impressive: zero to 30 mph in 3 seconds; 93-mile range; miles-per-gallon gasoline equivalent of 370; front airbags, ABS, ADAS, and a steel frame; and swappable 9-kWh battery that tops up in 5.4 hours from a household outlet. Two Nimbus versions are coming, with the One having a top speed of 50 mph and One S hitting 75 mph. But the real boon is that slender three-wheel design, as narrow as a motorcycle, maintains its balance by leaning into turns, making the Nimbus ideal for zipping through traffic.\nThe BMW i4 has been a hit for the German automaker, and rightly so. But it\u2019s about to get a little bit better thanks to a 2024 refresh. Though camouflaged when it was spotted being test-driven, it looks as if the exterior design isn\u2019t getting much of an overhaul\u2014grilles remain the same with the radar to one side, the bumper design looks mostly untouched, but the headlights feature a new LED signature. The rear bumper may well be reshaped, however, along with updated rear lights. The current i4 has up to a 365-miles range with a 80-kWh battery, but this is bested by the Model 3 Long Range\u2019s 391 miles, so expect BMW to address this as well as get the new iDrive 9 infotainment system.\nFollowing on from the SUV Eletre, which we very much approved of, is Lotus\u2019s first hyper-GT, made to take on the Porsche Taycan. The four-door EV will go into production in 2024 making it the British brand\u2019s third electric model after the Eletre and the much-delayed Evija hypercar. The top model sporting adaptive air suspension and active aero will supposedly hit 893 bhp and launch from zero to 62 mph in a mighty 2.8 seconds. Rumor has it that Lotus will shove in a 102-kWh battery pack good for 10 to 80 percent refills in as little as 18 minutes with 350-kW charging. As for range, Lotus has said the Emeya will be able to drive from Amsterdam to Paris on a single charge, so that\u2019s a predicted max distance of around 315 miles.\nBYD\u2019s global EV dominance marches on with this fourth model being added to its UK lineup in early 2024. The Seal U is will be the first SUV from the brand for UK customers as its larger seven-seater, the Tang, only comes in left-hand drive. The Seal saloon is electric only and uses BYD\u2019s e-Platform 3.0, while the Seal U is a version of a car already sold in China with a choice of plug-in hybrid or pure electric. As a midsize SUV in electric form, the Seal U will be aiming to take on the Volkswagen ID.4 and Ford Explorer, and will have two battery sizes: 71 kWh and 87 kWh. The smaller should get 261 miles of range, the larger 311 miles\u2014but both will power 218-bhp electric motors. Charging from 30 to 80 percent should be as little as 28 mins for the 71-kWh model.\nVolvo would like everyone to focus on the news that 2024 is the year of its \u201cvalue\u201d EV designed specifically to lure new customers to the brand, and not, say, the fact that its seven-seat electric EX90 was due to be on the roads by end 2023 but has been delayed for more software development. The entry-level EX30 comes in three flavors: a single motor 51 kWh, single motor 69 kWh, and performance twin-motor 69 kWh. It sits on the smallest version of Geely\u2019s Sustainable Experience Architecture, which of course means it inevitably shares similar specs to the group\u2019s Smart #1 and Zeekr X. As we said in our review, \u201cThe top model is an NMC battery, twin motor, all-wheel-drive affair putting out 315 kW (428 hp) and zero to 62 mph in a frankly preposterous 3.6 seconds. This makes it Volvo's \u2018fastest accelerating car ever,\u2019 which feels very much like corporate posturing and is entirely unnecessary for such a segment of the market.\u201d\nAside from BYD, which has already made significant inroads in the West, there are numerous China auto manufacturers making waves in 2024, and while we may not be as familiar with the brands, their releases are possibly even more important because innovation and technological advancement that takes place in China soon influences or finds its way into EVs in the EU and US. Here\u2019s a quick roadmap compiled with the help of Mark Rainford from Inside China Auto.\nWith the Mega, Li Auto is putting aerodynamics front and center on a multi-purpose vehicle, yet giving German saloon levels of legroom in the third row. The company\u2019s first fully electric car can charge 500 km in 12 minutes, and will likely come with its latest NOA system, which features \u201cvalet parking\u201d (you get out at the parking entrance, and the car supposedly finds a space on its own and can then be summoned later) plus city full self-driving. But exports aren't expected until at least 2025.\nHuawei\u2019s car is built together with Chery and marketed as a direct rival to Tesla\u2019s high-end Model S. It features the Harmony OS with an excellent autonomous drive system that's capable of city-level autonomous driving. You still need to keep a hand on the wheel, but that\u2019s because of a Chinese regulation, not because the car can't drive itself. You get up to 855 km of range when measured with the CLTC testing standard, so more like 371 miles in reality. You also get a 215-km charge in 5 minutes. No word on exports, but Chery is China's largest exporter of cars so it's possible the S7 will be coming soon.\nNot much concrete information is available on this EV yet, but given Xiaomi's background in smartphones and smart home gadgets, it\u2019s an exciting vehicle; the company will be going head-to-head with Huawei's cars, but with less experience in the game. Supposedly there will be two powertrain options: a base rear-wheel drive version with power output at 220\u00a0kW (295\u00a0hp; 299\u00a0PS), and a more powerful all-wheel drive version producing 495\u00a0kW (664\u00a0hp; 673\u00a0PS). Top speed is limited to 130\u00a0mph for the base model, and 165\u00a0mph for the all-wheel drive version.\nThis superb EV came out in June 2023 in China, but it's coming to selected Western European markets in 2024. We loved the G9, but this smaller G6 comes in two drive variants: a basic one-engine 296-hp (221-kW) rear-wheel drive, and an all-wheel drive option putting out 480\u00a0hp (360\u00a0kW). The basic battery has a capacity of 66\u00a0kWh, while the larger one is 87.5\u00a0kWh. During the premiere, XPeng declared that the G6 was equipped with a fast charging speed that allows up to 300 additional kilometers of range in just 10 minutes, made possible thanks to the brand\u2019s new modular SEPA 2.0 platform.\nThe second car from the Geely and Baidu partnership after the JiYue (sometimes \u201cJidu\u201d) ROBO-1. It should feature a hefty chunk of Baidu\u2019s extensive self-driving ability, but unlike for the company's robotaxi services, no Level 4 self-driving tech is confirmed. It should be built on Geely\u2019s impressive SEA architecture, so we could be looking at an 800-volt electric system, at least 400 kW of power, plus a gargantuan central screen.\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\n\ud83d\udce9 Get the long view on tech with Steven Levy\u2019s Plaintext newsletter\nThe spy who dumped the CIA, went to therapy, and now makes incredible TV\nBlood, guns, and broken scooters: The chaotic rise and fall of Bird\nA demographic time bomb is about to hit the beef industry\nInside America\u2019s school internet censorship machine\nDispatch from the future: The must-have gadgets and gear of 2053\n\ud83c\udf32 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars\nJeremy White\nAdrienne So\nReece Rogers\nBoone Ashworth\nSimon Hill\nSimon Hill\nAdrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Coupon Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n50% Off DoorDash Promo Code + Free Delivery\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
