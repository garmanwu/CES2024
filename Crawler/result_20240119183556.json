Revealing innovative feature-packed TVs, sound bars and mobile devices to inspire greatness and deliver more meaningful experiences, TCL is once again pushing the envelope with its latest product introductions.\n\u201cComing out of such a strong 2023 has TCL excited to up the ante this year as we prepare to launch more innovation, including the world\u2019s largest Mini LED TV at a jaw-dropping 115\u201d screen size. Going bigger is just one of the ways we continue to strive to be the best-selling TV brand in the U.S. We will also deliver much better quality, technology, and value for our users thanks to our vertical integration strengths,\u201d said Mark Zhang, President, TCL North America. \u201cIn order to turn one of the world\u2019s largest TV manufacturers into America\u2019s preferred consumer electronics brand, we will also continue to invest our resources beyond televisions so TCL\u2019s audio, mobile and home appliance categories become just as successful.\u201d\nTCL Television\nKnown for offering the best combination of quality, technology, and value, in 2024 TCL will raise the bar in TV technology. At the top of the TCL Q Class will be the new QM7 and QM8 QD Mini LED models. These sets are premium Mini LED utilizing high-zone local dimming and incorporating advanced TCL backlight and processing technologies. The flagship QM8 level will also add a new mega-size 115\u201d model, which will be the world\u2019s largest QD Mini LED TV. In addition, TCL will expand its 98\u201d QLED TV offering with three new models at the Q6, QM7 and QM8 levels.\nIn S Class, TCL will introduce the new S5. This best-in-class 4K UHD level will offer up to 25% more brightness and for the first time at the S Class level, will incorporate the TCL AIPQ Processor to ensure the bright images are also sharp and clear.\nFor 2024, TCL TV has moved to the next level in Mini LED backlight technology with QD Mini LED, enhanced QLED Color, three levels of TCL AIPQ Processing including in S Class, built-in Multi-Channel TV sound, new features such as Enhanced Dialog Mode for easy listening, improved FullView 360 cosmetic design, which is enhanced from the front, side and rear, and expanded larger sizes including the mega-size 115\u201d screen.\nTCL Audio\nTo complement its new TVs, TCL will take sound to all new heights by introducing a full line of Dolby Atmos sound bars. TCL\u2019s Q Class sound bars complete a high quality home theater. In 2024, the Q75H and Q85H models will include Ray-Danz acoustic wave-guide reflectors for a super wide sound stage. The Q75H is a 5.1.2 sound bar that includes built-in Dolby Atmos up firing speakers, and built-in side surround speakers, for premium surround sound. The Q85H is a 7.1.4 sound bar that adds wireless rear speakers which incorporate rear Dolby Atmos up firing drivers, for truly enveloping sound.\nS Class sound bars include the S45H and S55H models, which are upgraded with Dolby Atmos, Auto Room Calibration, TV as Center Channel Mode, and a beautiful new cosmetic design. The S45H model includes a Built-in Bass Reflex Port for enhanced bass without a separate subwoofer, while the S55H adds a Wireless Subwoofer for room filling sound.\nTCL Mobile\nA leader in display technology across feature-rich smartphones, tablets, and connected devices, TCL also announced at CES 2024 its latest advancements aimed at making technology more human and 5G more accessible. Most notable was the debut of TCL NXTPAPER 3.0, the latest generation of TCL's pioneering display technology. TCL expanded its tablet portfolio and demonstrated the 50 Series of smartphones, affirming its commitment to democratize 5G and underscoring TCL's relentless dedication to developing technology that smoothly integrates into our everyday lives.\nThe TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro and TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G tablets, for the U.S. market, are a testament to TCL's focus on the integration of innovative technology, user-centric design, and digital well-being.\nThe brand-new TCL 50 Series marks TCL's fifth generation of smartphones, bringing an array of distinctive models, from 5G devices to an extended selection of NXTPAPER smartphones. Equipped with dual speakers and larger screens, there is a model to meet the needs of any user. The series showcases innovations such as an e-reader mode for book enthusiasts and super-fast 5G connectivity for users always on the move. Each model in the series is designed to provide seamless entertainment, efficient productivity, and comfortable user experience. With the TCL 50 series, every user can find a smartphone that perfectly matches their lifestyle. The series leads off with five models dedicated for the U.S. market: TCL 50 XL NXTPAPER 5G, TCL 50 XE NXTPAPER 5G, TCL 50 XL 5G, TCL 50 XE 5G, and TCL 50 LE.\nIn addition to the remarkable new phones and tablets, TCL\u2019s subsidiary RayNeo announced the RayNeo X2 Lite. This builds on the groundbreaking full-color binocular, wave guided OLED displays of the previous generation, but is the first manufacturer to add the power of the Snapdragon AR1 processor platform. The lighter and more stylish design also means they can be worn for longer, in real-world conditions.\nTCL Home Appliances\nA global leader in appliances, TCL offers a wide range of home products in North America and will continue to build out the category with innovative solutions. From home comfort products such as robot vacuums that allow almost entirely hands-free cleaning and smart air conditioning that cools surroundings to a more comfortable temperature, to advanced air purifiers\u00a0that freshen the air and dehumidifiers that remove moisture to improve home health, TCL will expand its appliance offerings with exciting new additions to meet the demand for high quality home solutions.\nWith smart products in every category, like refrigeration that provides performance and preservation in a beautiful package,\u00a0users can enjoy the TCL Home Experience by connecting TCL devices with the TCL Home App and TCL Home Console. The TCL Home App allows device control using just a smartphone while the TCL Home Console is a unique way to control TCL smart devices through a TCL TV.\nTo learn more about TCL and its products, please visit booth #18708 in the Las Vegas Convention Center Central Hall at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show, January 9-12, or visit\u00a0go.tcl.com/ces.\nAbout TCL\nTCL Electronics specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of consumer electronics including TVs, mobile phones, audio devices, smart home products and appliances.

That\u2019s the screen size of the World\u2019s LARGEST QD-Mini LED TV, only from TCL.\nThat\u2019s a whole new level of immersion, that\u2019s already led to one reviewer say that our 115\u201d TV simply, \u201chas no competition.\u201d\nRaising the Bar for Big Screens\nOf course, we have some of the biggest TVs out there, but we also have a line of new 2024 TVs that have raised the bar for nearly every customer.\nOur S Class introduces the all new S5 Series, which has many new great technologies, many for the first time in our S Class TVs. This includes our High Brightness LED backlight for up to 25% more brightness and more vibrant images. Plus, for the first time ever on an S Class TV, S5 also gets the new TCL AIPQ Processor with AI Super Resolution to ensure that the bright colorful images are also sharp and clear. In addition, S5 includes HDR PRO+ with both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, so overall image quality is brighter, clearer, and more vivid.\nOur Q Class TVs helped define performance and value in 2023, and for 2024 we are not letting up! The Q6 adds QLED color, a technology we helped pioneer by introducing the world\u2019s first big screen quantum dot TV back in 2015, bringing the Hollywood color standard into your living room! And our High Brightness Plus LED Backlight for 28% more brightness. There\u2019s even 120 VRR gaming for blistering fast gameplay, and the larger sizes (the 85\u201d model and now a new wall-devouring 98\u201d) get the added performance of a 120Hz panel.\nOur Q6 Pro raises the bar by adding one of my favorite features to really bring out the performance in an LED TV: A Full Array Backlight with Local Dimming. With the TV broken into zones with the LEDs controlling the contrast. This is the only technology that allows an LED to have the blackest blacks and brightest whites on screen at the same time.\nOur Q7 put the industry on notice in 2023 that a well-executed Full Array TV could perform as well as competitors\u2019 Mini LED TVs that did not offer the high zone count to truly bring out the potential of Mini LED technology. Now, for 2024, QM7 incorporates TCL\u2019s premium High-Zone QD Mini LED with precise control of up to 1,500+ Zones. In addition, it adds the new High Brightness ULTRA LED Backlight with incredible brightness up to 2,400 Nits Peak, and QLED PRO color. This brings the QM7 performance envelope to what would have been better than flagship TVs just a few short years ago.\u00a0 Here we also ramp things up with our TCL AIPQ PRO Processor, a higher level of processing for high-speed, high-zone TV.\u00a0 The QM7 also brings flagship level performance and features like a premium center-mount stand, IMAX Enhanced Certification, and AMD FreeSyncTM Premium Certification.\nAnd for 2024, we are redefining the term flagship TV once again with our new QM8, which includes the incredible QD Mini LED ULTRA for Ultra High-Zone Dimming with up to 5,000+ Zones. This is over 2X the number of zones of the previous flagship level for truly inky blacks. Also included is the High Brightness ULTIMATE LED backlight with up to 5,000 nits peak brightness, and QLED ULTRA, for incredibly dynamic images.\nSound Goes to New Heights\nIf audio is half the moviegoing experience, then TCL is really helping make that experience better in 2024!\nOur new S Class and Q Class sound bars have what it takes to immerse you into your favorite game or movie!\nOur S class offers great performance and great value.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nTCL 2024 TV lineup: All the new QLED TVs coming this year\nTCL's budget TVs get AI upgrades\nMirroring other TV makers, TCL is pushing into new innovative bounds with the introduction of a more advanced AI system-on-chip made in-house to deliver powerful on-screen upscaling and TV UX improvements. It's all apart of the magic that is CES 2024, where AI is everywhere.\nThe three tiers of TCL chips include the base AIPQ, which for the first time ever will be on its S551G 4K TV, the AIPQ Pro, as found on its QM7 and QM8 models, and the AIPQ Ultra, which will only be on the high-class QM891G QD Mini LED, a stunner of a 115-inch TV.\nTCL pushed into new territory in 2023, giving Samsung a run for its money with as much as a 16.3% growth over the previous year, and it's vying for a similar win come 2024 with exciting new releases in its Q Class series lineup, such as the aforementioned QM891G QD Mini LED TV.\nEnhancements on the QLED side are also plentiful, with the QM651G-Pro gaining some serious new features thanks to its sparkly new AIPQ processor. Major quality of life upgrades include Full Array Local Dimming (FALD), hands-free voice control, and even a backlit remote.\nTCL is making massive strides with its 4K TV options, too, highlighting the S551G as a major new addition with improved LED backlighting, the inclusion of HDR Pro+ support, and a bezel-less design for exceptional qualities at every angle.\nTCL 2024 TVs: Q Class (QD Mini LED)\nQM751G\nThe most budget option among TCL's newest mini LED lineup is the QM751G, a robust, IMAX Enhanced panel with a 120Hz refresh rate (144Hz VRR), AMD FreeSync Premium, a 2.1 channel speaker, and HDR Ultra support with Dolby Vision IQ.\nLike most of TCL's newest models, the QM751G boasts similar gains in brightness and contrast ratios, taking home as much as 2,000 nits of peak brightness in tandem with more than 1,300 dimming zones, and a color gamut of 95% on the DCI-P3 scale. A new 98-inch model should give the QM751 mini LED incredible legs for those looking for a quality TV at a massive scale.\nHere are the QM751G sizes TCL has announced so far: 55, 65, 75 and 98 inches.\nQM851G\nLeveraging the TCL AIPQ Pro processor is the QM851G Mini LED, a 120Hz display with some incredible enhancements like a 2.1.2 channel speaker system, 97% color gamut on the DCI-P3 spectrum, more than 5,000 dimming zones, and up to as much as 5,000 nits of peak brightness.\nLike its much larger 115-inch companion, the QM851G will be a next gen TV with an ATSC 3.0 digital tuner, WiFI 6, and an anti-glare screen. It will support 240 VRR via Game Accelerator and AMD FreeSync Premium so gamers aren't left in the dust.\nHere are the QM851G sizes TCL has announced so far: 65, 75, 85 and 98 inches\nQM891G\nArguably the most exciting entries among TCL's new lineup is the gorgeous 115-inch QM891G Mini LED, which leverages the firm's most powerful chipset, the AIPQ Ultra. It can hit a peak brightness of more than 5,000 nits, has 20,000 dimming zones for impeccable contrast, and has as much as 98% coverage of DCI-P3 color.\nA 6.2.2 channel speaker will certainly keep the room well-occupied with sound, aided by a built-in subwoofer and up-firing Atmos speakers. But what about gaming? Well, the QM891G Mini LED comes equipped with a 120Hz refresh rate that can hit 240Hz VRR via Game Accelerator, while AMD FreeSync Premium ensures there's little if any screen tearing amidst the high-paced action.\nThe inclusion of ATSC 3.0 makes this a true next-gen TV, sporting additions like an Anti-Glare screen, WiFi 6, and Motion Rate 480 for the most well-rounded display under the TCL banner.\nThe TCL QM891G Mini LED will only be available in a 115-inch model.\nTCL 2024 TVs: Q Class (QLEDs)\nQ651G-Pro QLED\nAt the highest tier of TCL's QLED lineup is the Q651G-Pro, a stunning quantum dot model with tons of enhanced features, highlighted by gaming upgrades such as a 120Hz refresh rate that can be bumped to 240Hz VRR through the new Game Accelerator on the Enhanced 85-in model.\nNew inclusions like hands-free voice control, full array local dimming (FALD), and the bezel-less design gift the Q651G-Pro an exceptional leg up over competitors. A reworked panel that has high brightness pro LED backlighting is also a welcome new addition, gifting this QLED as much as 33% higher peak brightness.\nHere are the Q651G-Pro QLED sizes TCL has announced so far: 55, 65, 75, and 85 inches (Enhanced)\nQ651G QLED\nAlthough it might drop the Pro from its name, the Q651G QLED is hardly less impressive. Emulating its more premium brethren, the Q651G also will have more pronounced LED backlighting for nearly 28% brighter ratios over its predecessor. It also features a bezel-less design and comes in an all-new 98-inch model.\nBoth the 85- and 98-inch options will have advanced gaming features, like a 120Hz refresh rate that can be increased to 240Hz via VRR. Models under the 85-inch designation will have 120Hz VRR gaming instead, in tandem with Motion Rate 240 via MEMC and newly enhanced software features thanks to the included AIPQ processor.\nStandard additional features will also be present on the Q651G QLED, like Dolby Atmos support, DTS Virtual: X, and ALLM. The 6 series remains a staple of the brand, ranked as among the best TCL TVs this previous year and 2024 may well be no different.\nHere are the Q651G QLED sizes TCL has announced so far: 43, 50, 55, 65 and 75 as well as Enhanced 85- and 98-inch versions.\nTCL 2024 TVs: S551G 4K TV\nS551G\nIt wouldn't be a TCL TV roundup without a product geared specifically for the budget 4K TV crowd. That's where the S551G 4K TV shines brightest, soaking in some much-needed enhancements over predecessors, like HDR Pro+, a FullView 360 Metal Bezel-less design, and the sparkly new AIPQ processor.\nThanks to these new features, the S551G can now claim a more feature-rich backbone with the inclusion of TV as Center Mode, Hospitality Mode, Enhanced Dialog, and Custom Install Capability. It will also come equipped with standard features, like Motion Rate 240 via MEMC, Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual: X, and ALLM.\nHere are the QM891G sizes TCL has announced so far: 43, 50, 55, 65, 75 and 85 inches.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Headlining the announcements is the introduction of the advanced TCL NXTPAPER 3.0, the latest generation of TCL's pioneering display technology. In addition, TCL presents an expanded tablet portfolio and a fresh line of 50 Series smartphones, affirming its commitment to democratize 5G and underscoring TCL's relentless dedication to developing technology that smoothly integrates into our everyday lives.\n\"As we step into 2024, we make a significant leap in our journey, humanizing technology and expanding it across our most comprehensive range of smart devices to date.\u201d said Aaron Zhang, CEO of TCL Communication, \u201cOur innovation is about reshaping the integration of technology into everyday life, making it more organic and accessible. With the introduction of the pioneering TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 technology, the considerable advancements in our TCL 50 Series, and our strides in democratizing 5G vision, we are actively narrowing the divide between technology and its accessibility. At TCL, we stand firm in our mission to inspire greatness by creating technology that empowers and connects everyone, everywhere.\"\nTCL NXTPAPER 3.0 - The display technology optimized for human eyes\nWith three years of efforts dedicated to eye comfort, TCL NXTPAPER has realized eye-care technology with harmful blue light filtering by up to 61% while retaining sharp images, vibrant colors, deep contrast and natural motion.

Designed with users in mind, TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 extends TCL's commitment to enhancing the overall digital viewing experience to a new level with a range of hardware and software upgrades.\nThe newly incorporated Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) screens, in tandem with NXTPAPER 3.0, simulate the \"emission - reflection - refraction\" path of natural light. This creates a visual experience close to reading books in natural light and further improves the screen\u2019s paper-like for extra eye comfort. Further strides in user comfort have been made with the integration of DC Dimming technology, which ensures a flicker-free visual experience in any scenario, thereby reducing eye strain.\nOn the software side, TCL introduces features designed to encourage healthier digital viewing habits.

Setting a new benchmark for tablet design and functionality, the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro now features the upgraded 3-in-1 VersaView UI, delivering the comfort of reading on paper and the classic aesthetic of a black and white user interface. This innovative feature eliminates the need for an e-reader \u2013 TCLNXTPAPER covers all aspects. Moreover, with its software-hardware integrated technology, the intuitive TCL NXTPAPER UI seamlessly switches between the standard tablet mode and color paper or ink paper modes through the dedicated NXTPAPER key, providing the best of both worlds at users' fingertips.\nSimultaneously, the TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G embodies TCL's commitment to universal 5G accessibility. It skillfully integrates high-speed internet access with the distinctive eye-comforting viewing experience offered by TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 technology. Emphasizing its rare 5G feature on tablet, the TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G delivers constant internet access, facilitating social interactions, light entertainment, quick video browsing, and immersive reading experiences all with default eye care features. Its 10-inch size ensures ease of portability, catering to users on the move, making entertainment and connectivity available on-the-go.\nTCL 50 Series - Upgraded Experiences, Enhanced Choices\nThe brand-new TCL 50 Series marks TCL's fifth generation of smartphones, bringing an array of distinctive models, from cost-effective 5G devices to an extended selection of NXTPAPER smartphones.

        "raw_content": "What TCL announced at CES 2024\nA NXTPaper tablet and one giant TV.\nIt\u2019s CES 2024 this week, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, and most of the major players in consumer tech are hosting their own shiny press events. TCL is no exception. The manufacturer is holding a livestream event on January 8 at 2PM ET. You can watch it on the company\u2019s website or YouTube, just in case you aren\u2019t anywhere near Las Vegas.\nWhat we expect\nTCL is a huge company that manufacturers a wide range of devices across multiple product categories, though it\u2019s most famous for its TVs. The company promises to showcase over 100 \u201ccutting-edge products\u201d throughout CES, including QD-Mini LED TVs, air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, mobile devices, commercial displays and much more.\nMore specifically, TCL plans on unveiling \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest\u201d QD-Mini LED TVs during the press conference. It already announced a 115-inch behemoth at IFA back in September, so this one would have to match or exceed that size.\nIt also promises a spate of new home theater products and a new device ecosystem that\u2019s being advertised as \u201cone of the industry\u2019s first smart connected mobile device entertainment solutions.\u201d TCL's being cagey on this one, though the company did say the tech would integrate with smartphones, tablets, smart glasses and other gadgets.\nTCL also tends to announce one or two quirky things, like last year\u2019s RayNeo X2 AR glasses. The company has teased something regarding this product for CES, though it remains to be seen if it's a full hardware refresh or just a system update. The company did make an off-hand mention about \u201cpowerful AI capabilities.\u201d\nFinally, there\u2019s a promise to show off the \u201clatest breakthroughs in display technology.\u201d This likely refers to the company\u2019s NXTPAPER tech, which optimizes displays for the human eye. This platform got a refresh back in February, but it looks like the color paper-like screen technology will be getting even more bells and whistles. In any event, we don\u2019t have long to find out.\nWhat TCL announced\nTCL unveiled the NXTPAPER 14 Pro, a large-format device that's both a tablet and giant e-reader. Our own Mat Smith got hands-on ahead of CES and his first impressions are now live. Separately, on a much different note, TCL also debuted a 115-inch TV, which it says is the largest MiniLED with Quantum Dot technology. The announcement is notable in that it better positions TCL (normally best known for budget TVs) to compete with premium brands like Sony, Samsung and LG.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Inspiring greatness in homes nationwide with its innovation, TCL continues to break down the barriers in home theater with its award-winning family of products. Its most premium line of QLED TVs aims to deliver better performance and bigger screens, featuring a broader range of Mini LED models and further enhancements for unmatched gaming, cinema, and sports experiences with complimentary sound bar offerings.\nA consumer electronics game changer since it first launched in North America, TCL introduced the world's first big-screen Quantum Dot TV, introduced the world's first Mini LED TV, and developed its own powerful TCL AIPQ Processor. TCL's 2024 lineup of smart S Class and QLED Q Class TVs will reinforce TCL's strength in the market with a litany of industry leading technologies and prove that TCL will be bringing the best and biggest screens to more customers this year.\n\"Last year was extremely successful for TCL as we maintained our position as top 2 best-selling TV brand in the US for the fifth consecutive year. TCL also achieved top 2 best-selling TV brand in the premium segment of QLED TVs in 2023, and 2024 is planned to be even more positive as we continue to raise the bar with innovation,\" said Chris Hamdorf, Senior Vice President, TCL North America. \"TCL will roll out our biggest screen size ever, and we will upgrade our line with more choices in both 98\" TVs and Mini LED TVs to meet consumer demand. We will continue to provide unmatched value for the consumer and our high-performance products will be second to none.\"\n2024 TCL TelevisionsTCL will raise the bar in 2024 with an expanded and enhanced TV line-up. TCL will continue to segment the TV line into S Class for Smart TV, and Q Class for QLED TV, introducing new premium QD Mini LED inside Q Class. The new enhancements include better backlighting, enriched color, a range of TCL AIPQ Processing, built-in multi-channel sound, new mega size, and modern cosmetic designs for significant improvements to picture and sound technology.\nTCL S Class TV\nIn S Class, TCL will introduce the new S5, which offers best-in-class 4K UHD performance. The S5 incorporates a High Brightness LED Backlight for up to 25% more brightness and enhanced color, resulting in more vibrant images. For the first time, TCL's S Class also features a new TCL AIPQ Processor with AI Super Resolution to ensure the S5's bright colorful images are also sharp and clear. In addition, S5 includes HDR PRO+ with both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for overall brighter, clearer, and more vivid image quality.\nFor TV audio, S5 adds the new Enhanced Dialog Mode and the new TV as Center Channel Mode, to ensure easy listening, even with loud content. For connectivity, TCL's S5 will be the first S Class model to receive custom install capability for more advanced applications. All of this comes wrapped in the beautiful new FullView 360 cosmetic design, that looks great from every angle - front, back, and side. The new S5 will be available in 43\" to 85\" screen sizes.\nTCL Q Class TV\nTCL's Q Class sets itself apart with Quantum Dot Technology for rich QLED Color. The first new series, TCL's Q6, adds the High Brightness Plus LED Backlight for an additional 28% more brightness. The combination of high color and more brightness means more color volume for better overall picture quality. For gamers, Q6 also adds the Game Accelerator 120 feature that allows fast 120 VRR gaming. TCL's 85\" and larger Q6 models also include a native 120Hz Panel Refresh Rate with clear fast motion so gamers can step up to Game Accelerator 240 for blistering fast 240 VRR gaming on a big screen TV. The new Q6 will be available in 43\" to 98\" screen sizes.\nNew for 2024 is TCL's Q6-Pro, with all the great features of Q6 plus Full Array Local Dimming for deeper black levels and up to 33% more brightness with 600 peak nits. In addition, Q6-Pro will offer conveniences such as hands-free voice control, a backlit remote, and adjustable width feet on larger sizes. The new Q6-Pro will be available in 50\" to 85\" screen sizes.\nProviding consumers with even more premium options, TCL adds another Mini LED model to the Q Class family - QM7. The QM7 incorporates premium High Zone QD Mini LED with precise control of up to 1,500+ Zones. It also adds the new High Brightness ULTRA LED Backlight with incredible brightness up to 2,400 peak nits, and QLED color PRO. Utilizing the enhanced TCL AIPQ PRO Processor, the QM7 is a high-speed, high-zone TV.\nAs a true premium TV, QM7 includes a host of other technologies including a native 120Hz Panel Refresh Rate on all screen sizes, Game Accelerator 240, HDR ULTRA with Dolby Vision IQ, a 2.1 Channel Speaker System with built-in subwoofer, and an elegant adjustable height pedestal stand (65- to 85-inch sizes). With IMAX Enhanced Certification and AMD FreeSync Premium Certification, the TCL QM7 is a certified winner. The new QM7 will be available in 55\" to 98\" screen sizes.\nAt the flagship level is the QM8 which includes the incredible QD Mini LED ULTRA for Ultra High Zone Dimming with up to 5,000+ Zones. This is more than twice the number of zones of the previous flagship level for truly inky blacks. Also included is the High Brightness ULTIMATE LED Backlight with up to 5,000 peak nits, and QD color ULTRA, for incredibly dynamic images. This is 2.5 times brighter than the current \"brightest TV ever.\"\nThe QM8 includes all the great features of the QM7, plus an Anti-Glare Screen to maintain contrast in ambient room light conditions, 2.1.2 Channel Speaker System with Built-in Dolby Atmos Speakers for a wider and higher sound stage, and Next Gen TV and Wi-Fi 6 for \"future proofing.\" The new QM8 will be available in 65\" to 98\" screen sizes.\nFor 2024, TCL introduces the world's largest QD Mini LED TV! With a 115\" screen, the new mega-size 115QM89 truly becomes the ultimate home theater. This model includes QD Mini LED ULTIMATE with a massively high 20,000 dimming zones. It also incorporates the TCL AIPQ ULTRA Processor, as even more horsepower is needed for such high zone control to ensure huge, yet pristine images. This new 115\" model includes all the features of the other QM8 models, plus a 6.2.2 Channel Speaker system for truly room filling sound.\n\"In 2023, TCL became the top brand in 98\" TV, proving our power in both bigger and better,\" said Scott Ramirez, VP, Product Marketing and Development, Home Theater. \"In 2024, TCL will raise the bar with our new premium QD Mini LED, providing a never before seen level of TV picture quality. We will also enhance sound quality, cosmetic designs, and screen sizes with more 98\" TVs and an all-new mega 115\" screen size. In short, TCL will continue our promise to provide the best possible combination of quality, technology, and value, from our new best-in-class S5 4K UHD, to our new industry leading QM8 QD Mini LED, and to our new complimentary Dolby Atmos sound bars. In 2024, you need to watch TCL!\"\n2024 TCL Sound BarsIn 2024, TCL Sound Bar will take sound to all new heights. All models will incorporate Dolby Atmos for a wider, higher sound stage and a better home theater sound experience. In addition, all models will also be upgraded with new features and new cosmetic designs. Just like in TV, the 2024 TV sound bar line-up will be segmented into S Class, and Q Class for Quality Home Theater.\nTCL S Class Sound Bar\nThe S45H is a new 2.0 Channel Dolby Atmos Sound Bar with Built-in Bass Reflex Port. This model provides great sound for the consumer that doesn't want a separate Subwoofer in the room. It also incorporates DTS Virtual:X and new advanced features like Auto Room Calibration and TV as Center Channel Mode. Plus, it sports a new, more attractive cosmetic design.\nThe\u00a0S55H is a 2.1 Channel Dolby Atmos Sound Bar. This model has all the key features of the S45H, but trades the Bass Reflex Port for a separate Wireless Subwoofer to create room filling sound.\nTCL Q Class Sound Bar\nThe Q75H is a 5.1.2 Channel Dolby Atmos Sound Bar. In addition to the features of the S55H, the Q75H includes the Ray-Danz Acoustic Wave-Guide Reflectors to direct sound across the width of the room. This model also includes a Center Channel Speaker, built-in tweeters, built-in up-firing Dolby Atmos Speakers, and built-in Side Surround Speakers.\nThe Q85H is a 7.1.4 Channel Dolby Atmos Sound Bar. Stepping up from the Q75H, it adds rear speakers that are wireless but also include rear up-firing Dolby Atmos Drivers. The Q85H creates truly enveloping sound, and a sound experience that needs to be auditioned.\nTo learn more about TCL and its products, please visit booth #18708\u00a0in the Las Vegas Convention Center Central Hall at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show, January 9-12, or visit\u00a0go.tcl.com/ces.\nAbout TCL\u00a0TCL Electronics specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of consumer electronics including TVs, mobile phones, audio devices, smart home products and appliances.

Headlining the announcements is the introduction of the advanced TCL NXTPAPER 3.0, the latest generation of TCL's pioneering display technology. In addition, TCL presents an expanded tablet portfolio and a fresh line of 50 Series smartphones,\u00a0affirming its commitment to democratize 5G and underscoring TCL's relentless dedication to developing technology that smoothly integrates into our everyday lives.\n\"As we step into 2024, we make a significant leap in our journey, humanizing technology and expanding it across our most comprehensive range of smart devices to date.\" said Aaron Zhang, CEO of TCL Communication, \"Our innovation is about reshaping the integration of technology into everyday life, making it more organic and accessible. With the introduction of the pioneering TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 technology, the considerable advancements in our TCL 50 Series, and our strides in democratizing 5G vision, we are actively narrowing the divide between technology and its accessibility. At TCL, we stand firm in our mission to inspire greatness by creating technology that empowers and connects everyone, everywhere.\"\nTCL NXTPAPER 3.0 - The display technology optimized for human eyesWith three years of efforts dedicated to eye comfort, TCL NXTPAPER has realized eye-care technology with harmful blue light filtering by up to 61% while retaining sharp images, vibrant colors, deep contrast and natural motion. In 2024, TCL proudly announces the launch of upgraded TCL NXTPAPER 3.0, elevating this groundbreaking technology to new heights with all the previous benefits kept. Designed with users in mind, TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 extends TCL's commitment to enhancing the overall digital viewing experience to a new level with a range of hardware and software upgrades.\nThe newly incorporated Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) screens, in tandem with NXTPAPER 3.0, simulate the \"emission - reflection - refraction\" path of natural light. This creates a visual experience close to reading books in natural light and further improves the screen's paper-like for extra eye comfort. Further strides in user comfort have been made with the integration of DC Dimming technology, which ensures a flicker-free visual experience in any scenario, thereby reducing eye strain.\nOn the software side, TCL introduces features designed to encourage healthier digital viewing habits. TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 includes an eye-care assistant that can gently send customized reminders to users to encourage breaks in screen time or change poor lighting conditions, aligning with expert recommendations for digital device usage.\nTCL's NXTPAPER Tablets: Power, Comfort, and 5G Accessibility RedefinedIn a significant stride towards harmonizing digital comfort with sophisticated design, TCL introduces the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro and TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G tablets, for the U.S. market, at the occasion of CES 2024. Each device is a testament to TCL's focus on the integration of innovative technology, user-centric design, and digital well-being.\nThe TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro stands as a pinnacle of high-performance combined with unparalleled eye comfort, meticulously crafted for individuals seeking powerful functionality without compromising visual health. Showcasing the advanced capabilities of TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 technology, this tablet offers an immersive yet eye-friendly viewing experience with CPL and DC dimming. Setting a new benchmark for tablet design and functionality, the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro now features the upgraded 3-in-1 VersaView UI, delivering the comfort of reading on paper and the classic aesthetic of a black and white user interface. This innovative feature eliminates the need for an e-reader \u2013 TCLNXTPAPER covers all aspects. Moreover, with its software-hardware integrated technology, the intuitive TCL NXTPAPER UI seamlessly switches between the standard tablet mode and color paper or ink paper modes through the dedicated NXTPAPER key, providing the best of both worlds at users' fingertips.\nSimultaneously, the TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G embodies TCL's commitment to universal 5G accessibility. It skillfully integrates high-speed internet access with the distinctive eye-comforting viewing experience offered by TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 technology. Emphasizing its rare 5G feature on tablet, the TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G delivers constant internet access, facilitating social interactions, light entertainment, quick video browsing, and immersive reading experiences all with default eye care features. Its 10-inch size ensures ease of portability, catering to users on the move, making entertainment and connectivity available on-the-go.\nTCL 50 Series - Upgraded Experiences, Enhanced Choices\nThe brand-new TCL 50 Series marks TCL's fifth generation of smartphones, bringing an array of distinctive models, from cost-effective 5G devices to an extended selection of NXTPAPER smartphones. Equipped with dual speakers and larger screens, there is a model to meet the needs of any user.\nThe TCL 50 Series embodies TCL's commitment to user choice and experience.

Both of them combine TCL NXTPAPER display with dual speakers for natural and comfortable audio-visual experience.\nThe TCL 50 XL 5G takes the viewing experience a notch higher with a 6.8\" FHD+ 120Hz display. It also features dual speakers with DTS sound, 8GB RAM boosted by RAM expansion, as well as NXTURBO for smooth and immersive experience.

Optimized for human eyes, the third-generation technology includes several enhancements and an impressive suite of features designed to promote visual health.\nSince the unveiling in 2021, TCL has consistently advanced the unique TCL NXTPAPER technology that bridges the gap between smart devices and e-readers culminating in the introduction of NXTPAPER to TCL smartphones in 2023. TCL is proud to announce its TCL 40 NXTPAPER smartphone, has been honoured with the CES 2024 Innovation Award for Mobile Devices. Celebrating this recognition, TCL is now further pushing the boundaries of innovation with even more advanced technology and continue making strides in humanizing technology.\n\"At TCL, we believe that advancing technology is not simply about adding more features, but also making it more accessible,\" said Stefan Streit, CMO for TCL Communication. \"The success of NXTPAPER is a testament to our mission to humanize technology, with a focus on developing products optimized for human eyes. TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 builds on the success of earlier devices and offers users even more choices as we expand the NXTPAPER range to more TCL product categories and screen sizes in 2024.\"\nTCL NXTPAPER 3.0: Technology optimized for human eyes Building on the successful eye-care TCL NXTPAPER technology that is filtering harmful blue light by up to 61% while retaining sharp images, vibrant colors, deep contrast and the natural motion, TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 keeps these important benefits and introduces a range of features optimized for the senses of sight and touch. The central innovation is the introduction of the CPL (Circularly Polarized Light) screen, which simulates the \"emission - reflection \u2013 refraction\" path of natural light. This produces a visual effect that closely mirrors the experience of reading books in natural light, improving the screen's paper-like appearance and providing additional eye comfort. Bolstering this innovation, TCL NXTPAPER 3.0 also boasts higher refresh rates and DC dimming technology to ensure a flicker-free viewing experience across all scenarios. Additionally, the newly improved Adaptive Color Temperature feature, powered by an RGB sensor, allows the TCL NXTPAPER display to automatically adjust and provide the most suitable color temperature based on time and ambient light. This guarantees a comfortable viewing experience, anytime, anywhere.\nTCL NXTPAPER technology software includes a built-in eye-care assistant to send reminders and support users in developing healthier digital viewing habits. The rest reminder encourages breaks during prolonged use, assisting users in adopting the '20-20-20' rule, namely a 20-second break every 20 minutes and focus on an object 20 feet away, a practice often recommended by eye health experts. In addition, the function can also detect poor lighting or whether a user is too close and send gentle reminders. For an immersive experience, users can easily disable these features with a single click.\nIn 2024, TCL will launch a variety of tablets and smartphones equipped with NXTPAPER 3.0 technology in the global market later this year, starting with devices for the U.S. market, at the occasion of CES 2024, including the NXTPAPER 14 Pro tablet, TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G tablet, and 50 Series smartphones. TCL devices with NXTPAPER 3.0 also now feature an improved user interface, providing 3-in-1 UI optimized for different viewing scenarios. This includes a normal view for general use with default low blue light and no yellow tint, a low-contrast Color Paper Mode for comic reading, and a black and white Ink Paper mode for an aesthetically pleasing e-reader experience.\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro: Superior Visual Experience & Superior Power\nThe TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro, the first tablet infused with NXTPAPER 3.0, and a testament to TCL's commitment to superior visual experience and eye comfort. Its large 14\" 2.8K display, equipped with CPL technology and DC dimming, provides unprecedented eye comfort. Despite its expansive display, the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro maintains a slim and lightweight profile. Powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 8020 and a hefty 12GB of RAM, the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro is a productivity powerhouse. With a substantial 12000mAh battery, 33W fast charging, and 256GB ROM, it can support both work and entertainment.\nTCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G: Merging Seamless Connectivity with Enhanced Eye Comfort for a Superior Viewing Experience\nThe TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G brings your favorite content to life with a 10.4\" 2K NXTPAPER display.\u00a0 Running on the latest Android\u2122 14 and equipped with a speedy Octa-core processor and 5G connectivity, this tablet ensures seamless multitasking and video streaming. It's powerful, lightweight and stylish for on-the-go entertainment and connectivity for the whole family.\nExpanding the TCL NXTPAPER Range: Upcoming Models in the TCL 50 Series SmartphonesIn the course of 2024, TCL is set to incorporate NXTPAPER technology into a broader range of models in the TCL 50 Series smartphones, including the U.S devices TCL 50 XL NXTPAPER 5G and TCL 50 XE NXTPAPER 5G, and more.\nTo learn more about the TCL products announced at CES 2024, please visit: https://www.tcl.com/global/en/ces\nAbout TCL CommunicationTCL Communication specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of smartphones, tablets and connected devices.
