        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nI saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 products impressed me\nThe innovations happening in the TV space are making content more immersive to consume than ever and the world's leading TV maker led the charge at CES 2024 with meaningful upgrades across its top devices, the launch of new product lines, and two first-in-the-world breakthroughs.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nI got to go eyes-on with everything Samsung unveiled in Las Vegas in its new lineup of TVs, computer monitors, and home entertainment devices and these are the four things I was most excited to share with you.\n1. S95D OLED TV's new \"glare-free\" matte finish\nOne of the simplest 2024 upgrades was also the most impressive to see in person. Samsung's new \"Glare Free OLED\" that it's bringing to the top-of-the-line S95D OLED makes this TV the best one to look at in the entire Samsung lineup. When you combine the beautiful contrast and vibrant color of Samsung's QD-OLED technology with the new matte finish, it produces a TV that is a pleasure to watch from any angle and in the brightest or darkest rooms.\nAlso: Samsung unveils 2024 TVs with AI features that you'd actually want to use\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nInstead of being a giant black mirror like most of today's TVs, the matte finish on the S95D disperses and softens the light from lamps and windows into a minimal glow that's overpowered by the brightness of Samsung's OLED display.\nMy buddy David Katzmaier from CNET did a test where he held up a phone with a completely white screen in front of the new matte S95D and then in front of last year's S95C. Last year's model was like a mirror reflecting back the shape of the phone, while the new glare-free model softened the light into a minimal round glow. ZDNET's Kerry Wan and I did a similar test using the flashlight from Kerry's phone -- with even more intense light -- and got a similarly pleasing result.\nWith the effectiveness of this new matte finish and Samsung's already-great QD OLED technology, I'm confident the S95D will be a top contender for best picture quality in the world among all TVs in 2024.\n2. The Premiere 8K projector\nSamsung announced the world's first 8K wireless ultra short throw projector, and I spent a good deal of time soaking it in at Samsung's First Look event at CES. In the demo area, it was projected onto a 150-inch ambient light rejection (ALR) screen that makes a projector's picture look like a regular TV with its thin black frame around the edge, and is also reminiscent of being at the movies because of the size of the picture and the glare reduction you get from ALR. The result was a very cinema-like experience, and even though projectors can never match the contrast and dynamic range of OLED or QLED, the vibrance of the picture quality was very strong.\nAlso: Xgimi's new IMAX Enhanced projector is an entertainment beast, but wait until you see 'Aladdin'\nFor this new generation of projectors that we're seeing from Samsung and its competitors, 8K makes a lot of sense because they are bringing 100-inch and larger TV displays to a lot more people. And at that size, the extra level of detail and sharpness you get with 8K starts to make a notable difference in picture quality.\nEven at 150 inches, the Premiere 8K projector only had to sit 12 inches from the wall to project an image that large. With its stylish wooden finish, it's also one of the best-designed ultra short throw projectors I've seen. That matters since it's a big rectangular box that often sits awkwardly in your living room. It also comes with a matching One Connect box that you can place somewhere else in the room because it's wireless -- so you don't have to run a bunch of HDMI cables to that awkwardly placed projector box.\n3. Music Frame\nBuilding on the success of The Frame TV -- which turns a TV into a classic work of art or a family photo album when you're not watching something -- Samsung unveiled a new product line at CES 2024: the Music Frame. This product can serve as a hidden speaker to improve the sound of your home cinema experience or offer a much more aesthetically pleasing kitchen speaker than an Amazon Echo or Apple HomePod.\nAlso: Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here's the first model\nThis product masquerades as a standard picture frame and you can slip a photo or a piece of art into it. But it's very thick and has the look of a deep shadowbox, except that the photo or artwork is at the front, and it hides two sound woofers behind it at the back of the frame. You can use two Music Frames to create left and right speakers or a set of rear surround sound speakers that can pair with a Samsung soundbar and TV to create Q-Symphony intelligent surround sound.\nMusic Frame also has a similar frame style and colors to The Frame TV and could match nicely in a room where they were used together.\n4. Transparent Micro-LED display\nSamsung showed off the world's first transparent Micro-LED display and the demo was spectacular -- even if a little gimmicky for something that won't be a viable product for a while. On a slab of glass about an inch thick, the demo unit ran all kinds of flashy content from fireworks going off to vibrant paint splashing out of cans to sports infographics displaying on screen. The colors looked more intense and the display more transparent than competing transparent OLED screens from LG, which have been around for a few years.\nAlso: I saw Samsung and LG's new transparent TVs at CES, and there's a clear winner\nThat makes sense since Micro-LED is the display technology that will likely supersede OLED one day for the highest quality TVs. Samsung has been working for years on Micro-LED, which is best known for its place in The Wall, the absolutely massive and exorbitantly priced TV system that is mostly used in commercial installations like stadiums, car showrooms, large corporate conference rooms, and retail experiences, for example.\nSo why would anyone want a transparent TV or display screen? In the home, it would probably be little more than a virtual fish tank or perhaps a place to show the family calendar, leave messages, and play a slideshow of family photos. Perhaps that will make sense a decade from now when these displays are manufactured at low cost. But today, like The Wall, it will likely be limited to uses like high-end luxury boxes in stadiums where the glass to watch the game can also light up with player information, data points from the game, ads, and notifications. When it gets far cheaper, it could eventually be used to replace glass in public spaces such as bus stops and train stations to show the schedule and live updates.\nRelated\nSamsung's S95D OLED is the best TV of CES 2024 and best in the world right now\nThe best TVs of CES 2024\nThe best TVs for 2024: Expert tested and reviewed"

Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Guided by the theme All-in Innovative Tech: Paving the New Journey, Samsung Display prepared an exhibition to showcase its dynamic next-generation display products for both its partners and media. Join us as we dive into Samsung Display's new journey, positioning itself at the forefront of the fast evolving display industry.\nSamsung OLED: The Epicenter of Display Innovation\nAt CES 2024, Samsung Display strategically organized its exhibition space into two major categories: large QD-OLED and small and medium-sized OLED, offering a diverse range of future display experiences. Within the small and medium-sized OLED exhibition area, which was divided into four distinct zones (Smartphone, IT, Automotive, and XR), visitors can immerse themselves in unique display technologies and ultra-high-resolution products designed for specific applications. Meanwhile, the expansive QD-OLED exhibition space, segmented into three zones (Technology Evolution, TV, and Monitor), provides an insightful look into Samsung Display's technological advancements and products that have continuously evolved. Now, let's explore some of the groundbreaking products that defined the innovation at CES 2024.\nElevating Flexibility with Enhanced Foldable Phones\nEmbracing the theme of Easy to Flex, Tough to Break - OLED for Smartphone, the OLED for Smartphone Zone showcases Samsung Display's inventive technologies and products designed for optimal smartphone experiences. The Flex In & Out\u2122 Flip,\u00a0a standout product, employs In & Out Foldable technology in the recently popular flip phone-type foldable, enabling a 360-degree fold. Unlike traditional in-folding form factors that require a second panel on the outside for information viewing when folded, the Flex In & Out\u2122 Flip boasts a streamlined design with a single display for viewing information while folded, offering a lighter and thinner profile. What sets the Flex In & Out\u2122 Flip apart is its versatility. It is designed to accommodate various devices, including smartphones and tablets, depending on the folding configuration. Additionally, the screen can be folded inward for convenient storage, providing added protection against external shocks.\nThe Flex Liple: Lightweight and Simple\nThe Flex Liple stood out among the showcased Flex line-up products, generating the most enthusiastic response from visitors. The design concept, which combines the words \u201clight\u201d for lightweight and \u201csimple\u201d for easy access to existing Flex features, captured the attention of both the media and visitors. This innovative display serves multiple purposes, allowing users to check the time, make payments, and receive message notifications, even when folded.\nFlex Hybrid\u2122: Where Fold Meets Slide\nSamsung Display introduced Flex Hybrid\u2122 at CES 2023, a dual tech marvel that seamlessly integrates foldable and slidable features. When the foldable display is folded, information remains accessible by unfolding the slidable display. Furthermore, unfolding both displays provides an immersive video experience on a wider screen.\nIndomitable Durability, Defying the Harshness of Earth, Wind, Fire, Water and Ice! Basketball-Proof Resilience\nThis year\u2019s exhibition included rigorous durability tests to show the strength of Samsung Display's foldable technology. Demonstrating its capacity to endure some of the harshest conditions, Samsung\u2019s foldable technology was tested by folding panels in temperatures ranging from 60-degrees and minus 20-degrees, bouncing basketballs off foldable panels, rubbing smartphones in sand, immersing them in water. Testing Samsung's foldable technology against the five elements demonstrated its ability to withstand even the most challenging environments.\nOLEDs Redefine the IT landscape with Sheer Scale and Sleek Design\nEmbracing the More Enormous, More Efficient theme, the OLED display in the IT Zone presented Samsung Display's impressive range of large-scale and sleek OLED products. It showcased Samsung Display's competitive edge in the IT sector, especially amid the ongoing shift from liquid crystal displays (LCDs) to OLEDs.\nUltra Thin (UT) OLED panels features an impressive 0.6 mm thickness, similar to a standard business card. The UT design surpasses the capabilities of traditional LCDs and regular OLEDs. Achieving such a slim profile is made possible by eliminating one sheet of glass from the conventional OLED structure, which typically requires two sheets. Eliminating one sheet of glass enables the reduction in thickness and weight by over 60%, making it possible to produce thinner and lighter laptops. Furthermore, the implementation of a full oxide TFT substrate contributes to a remarkable screen refresh rate reduction to 1Hz. Such a substantial drop in refresh rate plays a key role in significantly reducing power consumption.\nSamsung Display also introduced its pioneering 8.6-generation IT OLED line, establishing an industry-first with the world's largest IT OLED production process. This innovative production line features a glass ledger (mother glass) measuring an impressive 2,290mm x 2,620 mm. To help the audience grasp the immense scale of the 8.6-generation glass, Samsung Display installed a full-scale model, or nearly 3-meters high, in the exhibition booth.\u00a0The size of the 8.6-generation glass ledger is more than twice as large as the previous Gen 6 glass ledger. Such a significant size increase not only significantly improves production efficiency but also facilitates the production of up to 88 panels for 14-inch laptops at a time, resulting in a highly cost-effective process.\nInnovation on Wheels: Driving into the Future with OLED-powered cars\nHow often do we find ourselves inside our cars? Cars have evolved from mere transportation into living spaces. In the OLED for Auto Zone, themed Innovation Takes the Wheel, Samsung Display presented its OLED products that are poised to transform vehicle interiors. In particular, the Flex Note Extendable\u2122 and Rollable Flex\u2122 products drew the attention of captivated visitors.\nDebuting at CES 2024, the Flex Note Extendable\u2122 introduces a fusion of foldable and slidable technology, adding the slidability to the Flex Note family. This innovative device features a foldable panel that unfolds and slides to extend the screen further. Initially measuring 12\" when fully folded, the Flex Note Extendable\u2122 expands to 14.8\" (1:1 aspect ratio) on one side and 17.3\" (4:3 aspect ratio) on the other, offering users a versatile UX by adjusting the aspect ratio to suit different purposes.\u00a0Whether utilized as a CID for navigation, a makeshift car office, or an extended screen for entertainment, the product adapts to various in-car scenarios. When not in use, the screen size can be minimized, seamlessly integrating with the car's interior.\nRollable Flex\u2122 Expands Over 5x\nThe Rollable Flex\u2122 is a panel that rolls up and unrolls like a scroll. It provides impressive scalability, extending over five times, with a range from 49mm to 254.4mm. Unlike traditional foldable and slidable form factors, which typically scale up to two to three times, Rollable Flex\u2122 surpasses these limitations. This is achieved by enabling the display to roll and unroll on an axis shaped like the letter \u201cO,\u201d introducing a new dimension of flexibility and scalability.\nDriving Convenience with Seamless Displays\nPremium vehicles today are embracing larger displays, including clusters and CIDs. Samsung Display's Seamless Display offers versatility from flat to curved, with a curvature range of 800- 1000R. Seamless Displays functionality shines during autonomous driving mode, providing access to diverse entertainment features on the dashboard. In driving mode, the display tilts left and right, directing its focus towards the driver's seat to help the driver focus on driving.\nXR Core Technology OLEDoS Unveiled!\nLet\u2019s now enter the OLED for XR Zone, which was themed New Visions, More Realistic. Here, we showcased microdisplay products designed for the extended reality (XR) market with ultra-high resolution. We unveiled an RGB ultra-high-definition OLEDoS (OLED on Silicon) display, featuring a pixel size in the tens of micrometers (\u339b). This breakthrough technology involves depositing organic materials on a silicon wafer, a key advancement for the emerging XR headsets. The RGB OLED is a technology that deposits red, green, and blue OLEDs individually on a wafer to produce colors without the need for a secondary light source. It has the highest resolution in the industry. At just 1.03 inches, it's as small as a KRW 500 coin, but with a pixel density of 3500 PPI (pixels per inch), it's as sharp as a 4K TV.\nSamsung Display set up a dedicated VR/AR zone, offering a vibrant experience with retro-inspired content through ultra-high-definition RGB OLED technology. The XR zone also showcases an array of military and defense products, including military helmets and night vision goggles from eMagin, a company specializing in OLED technology.\nDisplays Backed by Nobel Prize-Winning Science\nStep into the next frontier of displays as we enter the expansive QD-OLED exhibition booth, promising to ignite your visual senses. Did you know that Samsung Display is harnessing the Nobel Prize-winning quantum dot (QD) technology? This groundbreaking innovation, honored with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2023, is now elevating QD-OLED, unlocking the potential for richer and more vibrant colors in real-world displays. QDs are nano-sized semiconductor particles that absorb energy independently, producing pure and vivid colors. Samsung Display\u2019s QD-OLED is a testament to inventive technology, merging QDs \u2014 a Nobel Prize-winning display core technology \u2014 with OLED, a self-luminous technology. Pioneered by Samsung Display, QD-OLED is the world's first commercial realization of this transformative integration. Let's take a deep dive into this innovation.\nThird-Generation QD-OLEDs boast 3,000-nit brightness\nRemember the 2000nit QD-OLED that Samsung Display unveiled in 2023? At CES 2024, Samsung Display surprised visitors by introducing an even brighter Gen 3 QD-OLED. This latest iteration features an evolved luminance-boosting drive technology and a Quantum Enhancer with upgraded AI algorithms, pushing the brightness up to 3000nits. This enhancement allows users to enjoy vivid and bright picture quality in any environment. With a broader range of brightness, watching videos becomes a captivating experience \u2013 not only do sunlit landscapes dazzle with brightness, but HDR videos that require highlights, such as dark night scenes, come to life as if they were real.\nUnrivalled Picture Quality like No Other!\nIn the TV Zone, visitors are able to explore QD-OLED products showcasing vividly colorful screens under the theme of Unrivalled Picture Quality. Samsung Display has arranged products in various sections, allowing visitors to compare first-hand the performance and picture stability of the enhanced display technology in 2024.\nImage quality serves as a one of the key performance metrics for displays, with brightness (luminance) being a crucial factor in achieving high-quality visuals. The human eye and brain perceive brightness by considering factors like color purity, contrast ratio, and ambient illumination. Until now, brightness standards have been limited, unable to account for these surrounding factors. Samsung Display addresses this with the introduction of eXperienced Colour Range (XCR)\u2014a novel brightness measurement method that aligns with human cognitive characteristics. Recognized as a benchmark standard and adopted internationally by the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (SEMI), XCR is a breakthrough. At the exhibition, we've prepared a dedicated corner where visitors can directly compare the picture quality difference between QD-OLED products featuring superior XCR and other commercial products.\nA step to the side reveals a partnership with the renowned global authority in color standards, PANTONE. As the provider of the globally accepted Pantone Matching System (PMS), PANTONE certified Samsung Display QD-OLEDs as the first in the display industry to meet its standards, recognizing their absolute superiority in picture quality. At the exhibition, visitors are able to compare Pantone color chips from famous paintings with the colors displayed on QD-OLEDs, providing a firsthand look at how closely QD-OLEDs mirror the original colors.\nQD-OLEDs, the All-Around Player in the Monitor World\nWe now explore the final frontier in the monitor technology. Themed Let There Be STAR, this zone introduces the versatility of QD-OLED monitors. These monitors represent a promising leap into the future, venturing beyond the gaming and entertainment domains. QD-OLED technology is set to transform specialized fields, including imaging and medical industries, broadening its applications across diverse sectors.\nPixels of Passion, Gamers Revel in Ultra-High-Definition Monitors\nIntroducing the gaming marvel, the 27-inch QHD QD-OLED. Featuring an ultra-high refresh rate of 360Hz, this monitor is perfect for shooting and racing games enthusiasts, delivering seamless screen transitions and precise control. In the world of third-generation QD-OLEDs, the 31.5-inch QD-OLED steals the show with the highest pixel density ever achieved (140 PPI) and UHD resolution in a self-luminous monitor. This breakthrough is accomplished through the innovative Pico Inkjet process. With the introduction of 31.5-inch QD-OLED, Samsung Display reaffirms its leadership in spontaneous light displays. Leveraging pixel-by-pixel dimming of OLED and the impeccable color rendition of QDs, the 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor achieves an infinite contrast ratio. The result is a flawless 4K images, providing maximum immersion in high-speed games and optimal viewing for premium entertainment content such as 4K movies and OTT.\nBeyond Gaming, QD-OLED Monitors Offers Possibilities to Professionals\nAt CES 2024, Samsung Display showcased the versatility of QD-OLED monitors beyond the gaming world. The unmatched picture quality and color accuracy of QD-OLEDs make them perfect for intricate design tasks, medical monitors, and precise color reproduction in illustration and content creation at Hollywood studios. Color accuracy allows for efficient color correction work, making the technology highly suitable for professionals.\nMeanwhile, overseas media such as CNET have also shown a lot of curiosity and excitement about Samsung Display's advanced display technology, including the new foldable.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

        "raw_content": "Samsung adds wireless connectivity, touchscreen tech to its Premiere projectors\nAmong Samsung\u2019s many product announcements at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, the Korean electronics giant breathed some new life into its popular Premiere projector lineup. New models are bringing some bold firsts to the projector space, including the Premiere 8K that boasts wireless connectivity and sound that emanates from the screen, and the compact Premiere 5, an ultra short throw (UST) projector that can project onto 3D objects and has touchscreen features.\nSamsung Premiere 8K\nAnd while we\u2019re waiting for full details and demos of the projectors from CES 2024, here\u2019s what we know right now. Starting with the big guns, Samsung first announced The Premiere 8K UST (ultra short throw) projector last year at CES 2023, but released very few specs outside of it being capable of projecting a monstrous 150-inch image. A year later, it\u2019s still not available to purchase. And while full specs, pricing, or release dates still haven\u2019t been announced, we\u2019ve gotten a few more details on the projector.\nSamsung says The Premiere 8K \u201cachieves several new feats. For starters, it\u2019s \u201cthe world\u2019s first 8K projector with wireless connectivity,\u201d by way of Samsung\u2019s new Wireless One Connect Box that beams images from up to 10 meters (32.8 feet) away to the actual projector unit. All peripherals (such as steaming devices and DVD players) are connected to the box instead of the projector, making messy wires easier to conceal.\nNot only is the Wireless One Connect Box a first in The Premiere 8K, it\u2019s also the first of any Samsung product to offer this wireless tech. But the idea of a separate box to connect all your peripherals to so you can reduce wires to your TV isn\u2019t new. The wired version \u2014 the One Connect Box \u2014 has been around for a while and can be found in several of its current TVs. LG, meanwhile, debuted its own wireless version \u2014 the Zero Connect Box \u2014 in its M-series TV at CES 2023 to much fanfare. So far, none of Samsung\u2019s 2024 TVs feature the tech.\nThe other first with the Premiere 8K regards its sound features. Samsung says that it\u2019s the first 8K projector to offer 100-watt output and a new \u201cpatented Sound-on-Screen\u201d feature that it says is capable of creating \u201ctheater-like\u201d 8.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound that feels like its coming from the screen instead of from the speakers in the unit.\nBut what of the 8K image, you ask? A triple-laser light source with 4,000 lumens of brightness is in the driver\u2019s seat, which should bode well in even bright rooms, and that 8K resolution comes by way of AI upscaling (AI is the big theme of CES 2024) that can transform any 4K content to 8K . That\u2019s good because 8K content has yet to really make itself available in any meaningful way.\nOther features worth noting with the Premiere 8K is that the UST projector can throw its behemoth 150-inch picture when it\u2019s just 12-inches from the screen, which is great for those with limited space, and it has auto keystone, autofocus, screen scaling, and other smart features built in. And if it\u2019s anything like Samsung\u2019s previous Premiere projectors, such as the LSP7T and LSP9T (more on that below), we\u2019re in for a treat.\nSamsung Premiere 5\nThe second new projector Samsung announced at CES 2024 is what the company is touting as the \u201cdo-it-all\u201d Premiere 5, \u201cthe world\u2019s most compact (7.9 by 5.4 by 5.4 inches) triple-laser ultra short throw projector and touch interaction device,\u201d according to a press release. And yeah, the \u201ctouch interaction device\u201d part had our eyebrows raised, too, so let\u2019s jump ahead to that.\nFrom the press release: \u201cIn addition to a large-screen projection [up to 100 inches], you can use it as a second monitor or to decorate your own space. And its included tabletop accessory stand allows it to project onto a desk or table, turning the display into a touch-sensitive projector.\u201d And while we\u2019ll have to check it out to see for ourselves, the Premiere 5 is marketed as a diverse lifestyle device with a touchscreen feature that can be used \u201cas a touchscreen display for interactive tutorial videos or educational apps.\u201d\nSpecs are still limited at this point, but the 3.7-pound triple-laser UST projector can throw an image from just 17 inches, and it has several connectivity options (such as smartphone mirroring by tapping your device to the top of the projector) that can be quickly toggled through with a multifunction key.\nBrightness and contrast specs weren\u2019t shared in the release either, but it does mention autofocus, keystone, and color balance features. And like many smart projectors these days, The Premiere 5 can double as a Bluetooth speaker.\nLightwarp and other surprises\nLightwhat? Projecting movies, TV, and sports onto walls and projector screens is one thing, but Samsung also introduced another new feature to its 2024 Premiere projector lineup called \u201cLightwarp.\u201d It uses projection mapping tech that\u2019s mostly been used in professional and commercial settings, and it allows Premiere projectors (we are awaiting full confirmation if that includes the Premiere 7 and Premiere 9 mentioned below) to turn \u201cany object in the room into an interactive display surface,\u201d the press release says, adding that \u201cyou can project any content on your surface and even create a customizable dashboard with widgets, like a clock or the weather.\u201d\nSamsung also announced that its Samsung Gaming Hub, which owners of 2022 and newer\u00a0Samsung smart TVs, monitors, and its Freestyle projector (Gen 2) have enjoyed for some time, is also coming to the Premiere lineup, opening up cloud gaming on services such as Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Utomik.\nAnd lastly, Samsung announced upgrades to two of its most popular laser UST projectors, the LSP7T and LSP9T, which have new, much cleaner names: the Premiere 7 and Premiere 9. Again, details are slim, and we may learn more from the show floor at CES 2024, but all the press release mentions about the two new projectors is they\u2019ll be brighter (the current models feature 2,200 and 2,800 ANSI lumens, respectively), feature a \u201cQuantum 4K processor\u201d (up from the existing UHD processor), and will include Dolby Atmos (an improvement from having to use eARC passthrough for Dolby Atmos).\nStay tuned for more details on Samsung\u2019s new projectors from CES 2024 and beyond.\nHere's the thing about projectors: They are, generally speaking, not all that great to look at. And because they're a projector, they, by necessity, tend to be fairly conspicuous. The new LG CineBeam Qube aims to change that.\nThe Qube (model HU710PB, if you're keeping track of such things) fires out a 4K image at up to 120 inches in diagonal, thanks to an RGB laser light source. LG boasts a 450,000:1 contrast ratio here and 154% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, as well as support for HDR 10. It's a little lacking in brightness, though, at just 500 ANSI Lumens. So you'll want to keep that in mind if you're considering the Qube in any well-lit room.\nOne of the more exciting aspects of the latest Bluetooth 5.3 specification's LE Audio platform is the inclusion of Auracast. It's a clever way of turning Bluetooth devices like phones and TVs into mini radio stations that are able to broadcast audio over Bluetooth to an unlimited number of nearby wireless headphones, speakers, etc -- without the hassle of Bluetooth pairing.\nWe've been waiting for more than a year to see a major electronics player announce support for Auracast, and it's finally here: Samsung says it will be adding Auracast to its Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro and select 2023 TVs in September.\nSamsung's much-anticipated follow-up to its popular Freestyle portable projector, dubbed the Freestyle Gen 2, is now available for pre-order on Samsung's website today, but this time out the compact projector can also be used to play games in the cloud from anywhere.\nSamsung announced the Freestyle Gen 2 at CES 2023 earlier this year, and while it's not drastically different from its predecessor, the compact Full HD (1080 x 1920) projector maintains its high level of portability (it still weighs less than two pounds), substantial image size capability (30 to 100 inches) and its unique 180-degree swivel cradle stand that lets you project onto pretty much any surface.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
