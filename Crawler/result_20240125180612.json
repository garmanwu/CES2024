It's a mission we dedicate ourselves to as a global company. We are committed to engineering excellence so that our customers can focus on planting, feeding, building and caring for our world. We welcome you to explore and learn more about Kubota.\nKubota's small but mighty tractors quickly filled an unmet need with the 'do-it-yourselfers' by delivering compact, capable, and easy-to-use tractors for residential customers.\nThe versatility, reliability, and durability of Kubota's affordable, compact tractors resonated with American customers who took pride in working on their properties and land and Kubota quickly became the number 1 selling residential tractor in the United States.\nFollowing the popularity of the residential tractor was the introduction of the compact excavator in 1979 \u2014 another industry first for empowering customers with\u00a0construction\u00a0projects that demand compact yet capable machines.\nThese customers fueled the innovation of an expanded compact construction equipment line up and made Kubota the number 1 selling compact excavator in the United States.\nWhatever your dream, our goal has been to help you build, shape, and grow it, on your land, for your business,or in your community \u2014 at your side, for 50 years.\nKubota's History of Innovations\nAutomation\nAdvancements in automation empowers Kubota engineers to create machines that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just innovate the industry but stand the test of time.\nFeatured Stories\nData & AI\nData utilization empowers Kubota engineers to create software and AI programs to aid in agriculture, always keeping farmers at the center of what we do.\nFeatured Stories\nSustainability\nA clear commitment to sustainability drives Kubota to think outside the box, creating unique, Earth-centric ideas designed to lower carbon footprints.\nFeatured Stories\nIn the 1960s, Kubota needed a partner to bring its tractors to the United States. The company selected a respected brand to represent its tractors, McCulloch, and ordered 100 G-12 tractors and 100 D-20 tractors from Kubota to be sold in the United States.\nThese tractors were painted yellow and sold under the McCulloch name; Kubota was still unknown in the United States at the time, while McCulloch was known for its chainsaws.\nIt all started when Kubota\u2019s importer at the time, Marubeni, introduced the first Kubota-branded tractor to the United States with the L200. This powerful compact tractor quickly found success in an overlooked segment of the United States tractor\nmarket.\nHistorical photos. Kubota recommends the use of a roll-over protective structure (ROPS) and seatbelt in almost all applications.\nThe L175 was released soon after Kubota Tractor Corporation was created. There was initially some reluctance among dealers and it took hard work to sell those first Kubota tractors\u2014but customers quickly came around once they saw the quality and\nvalue of Kubota products. The L Series is still Kubota\u2019s flagship line to this day.\nHistorical photos. Kubota recommends the use of a roll-over protective structure (ROPS) and seatbelt in almost all applications.\nThrough market research, Kubota discovered there was a need for a small tractor that could provide big tractor features. This led Kubota to launch the 12-horsepower B6000, the first compact tractor to feature optional four-wheel drive. The compact size\nof the B6000 allowed it to easily fit into tight spaces and perform a variety of tasks that would otherwise be difficult to accomplish. This made the B6000 a game changer not only for Kubota, but the industry as a whole.\nWhen L245HC was released in the 1970s, it was far ahead of its time. With its canopy, offset axles, an offset driver position, an integrated belly chisel plow, a hopper spreader and portal axles, the L245HC was a very unique high-clearance tractor that\noffered a rare set of features that made it well suited for specialized organic farming techniques.\nKubota expanded into construction machinery with the introduction of the KH Series line of fully rotating compact excavators in 1979. While Kubota was gaining major recognition as a tractor company, it was a totally new face in the construction world.\nNonetheless, the quality and innovation of the brand quickly stood out from the rest, leading it to become the best-selling compact excavator* in the world.\n*Kubota is the world\u2019s #1 selling compact\u00a0excavator\u00a0for 18 years.\"\nDisclaimer:\u00a0According to 2021 data from Off-Highway Research including all Kubota Group brand sales.\nThis unique cutaway B8200 tractor model was commissioned by Kubota Tractor Corporation in the 1980s, likely soon after the model was first introduced in 1982. To allow for greater insight and understanding during educational training sessions, this B8200\nwas made with strategic cutouts that reveal parts of the tractor that were normally hidden from view.\nKubota introduced its first radio-controlled mower, the PX2100 concept, with four-wheel drive and crab steer in the late 1980s. It was a step out of the norm for Kubota\u2014it was purely built as a proof of concept and demonstration of design and innovation\nprowess for Kubota.\nThe BX Series opened a new class for the industry. Some customers really liked the B Series but either couldn't afford it or wanted the maneuverability of a garden tractor. The BX Series offered a better solution because the BX was capable of doing almost\neverything a compact tractor could do, but with easy operation and hydrostatic power steering. The BX2200 and the BX1800 were the first models.\nThe ZD Series zero-turn mowers were designed for professional operational performance and durability.\nThe RTV900, Kubota\u2019s first utility vehicle, was designed and developed in response to requests from dealers who felt there was a market for it. It combined proven tractor features with excellent hydraulic engineering, Kubota diesel technology and\na perfectly matched Kubota hydrostatic transmission.\nIn the 1960s, McCulloch ordered 100 G-12 and 100 D-20 tractors from Kubota to be sold in the United States. The 200 tractors ordered by McCulloch were ultimately unsuccessful, but this setback later proved to be a blessing in disguise. A team of Kubota\nemployees were sent to follow up with each and every store where the McCulloch tractors had been sold. Their efforts confirmed that there was a market for Kubota tractors, which could perform heavy-duty work that other garden tractors available in\nthe country could not. Based on these findings, Kubota made the decision to move forward with expansion into the United States with Marubeni as the company\u2019s direct distributor.\nSoon after Kubota Tractor Corporation was created, the L225 was released. While Kubota was a small, unknown brand back then, the compact size of the tractors set Kubota apart from the rest of the United States tractor market. This presented both a challenge\nand an opportunity.\nPreceded by the M4000, M4500 and M5500 models, the M7500 was the fourth tractor released in the M Series line. At the time, its greater size was an indication of Kubota\u2019s burgeoning interest in expanding into larger machines. The M Series still\ncontinues to extend the reach of Kubota today and it all began with the big step taken with the M7500. The M7500 seen here was originally owned by a flower farm in California and went on to be featured in the 2013 Rose Parade before being retired\u2014a\nfitting and memorable final showing for a tractor that provided over three decades of use.\nIn 1980, Kubota launched the B7100\u2014its first compact two- and four-wheel drive tractors with a hydrostatic transmission (HST). Previously predominantly available only in lawn and garden products and some farm tractors, the HST feature of the B7100\nrepresented a true innovation for the tractor category. Because the HST was operated by a foot pedal, similar to a car, even customers who were totally inexperienced with tractors felt comfortable using the B7100. It quickly became a popular model.\nThe B8200 was a successful tractor model for Kubota that sold well and provided great utility to users. Because this B8200 was well cared for by its original owners (a family who relied on it for nearly 40 years), it was in particularly excellent shape\nfor its age and level of use. In honor of those who own and love their Kubota tractors just as much, this tractor was not restored and is instead showcased as it was found.\nOne of the biggest milestones Kubota achieved in the 1980s was its expansion into mowers. The G Series of lawn and garden tractors were added to the product line in 1983. By breaking into the turf category, Kubota was able to diversify its product offerings\nand reach a whole new segment of customers.\nIn typical Kubota fashion, the G1800 was well known for its high level of build quality and was adored by owners. This particular G1800-S was misplaced in the Kubota warehouse before it was found again\u2014still in showroom-new condition\u2014many\nyears later.\nThis W5021 was actually used to mow the lawn at the former headquarters of Kubota Tractor Corporation in Torrance, California for several years. Later, it was put to use by the Engineering Department during the preparation process ahead of photoshoots,\ndealer sales and dealer meetings. After more than 30 years of service during its career at Kubota Tractor Corporation, this hardworking walk-behind mower was retired and lovingly restored.\nIn the 1960s, Kubota needed a partner to bring its tractors to the United States. The company selected a respected brand to represent its tractors, McCulloch, and ordered 100 G-12 tractors and 100 D-20 tractors from Kubota to be sold in the United States.\nThese tractors were painted yellow and sold under the McCulloch name; Kubota was still unknown in the United States at the time, while McCulloch was known for its chainsaws.\nIt all started when Kubota\u2019s importer at the time, Marubeni, introduced the first Kubota-branded tractor to the United States with the L200. This powerful compact tractor quickly found success in an overlooked segment of the United States tractor\nmarket.\nHistorical photos. Kubota recommends the use of a roll-over protective structure (ROPS) and seatbelt in almost all applications.\nThe L175 was released soon after Kubota Tractor Corporation was created. There was initially some reluctance among dealers and it took hard work to sell those first Kubota tractors\u2014but customers quickly came around once they saw the quality and\nvalue of Kubota products. The L Series is still Kubota\u2019s flagship line to this day.\nHistorical photos. Kubota recommends the use of a roll-over protective structure (ROPS) and seatbelt in almost all applications.\nThrough market research, Kubota discovered there was a need for a small tractor that could provide big tractor features. This led Kubota to launch the 12-horsepower B6000, the first compact tractor to feature optional four-wheel drive. The compact size\nof the B6000 allowed it to easily fit into tight spaces and perform a variety of tasks that would otherwise be difficult to accomplish. This made the B6000 a game changer not only for Kubota, but the industry as a whole.\nWhen L245HC was released in the 1970s, it was far ahead of its time. With its canopy, offset axles, an offset driver position, an integrated belly chisel plow, a hopper spreader and portal axles, the L245HC was a very unique high-clearance tractor that\noffered a rare set of features that made it well suited for specialized organic farming techniques.\nKubota expanded into construction machinery with the introduction of the KH Series line of fully rotating compact excavators in 1979. While Kubota was gaining major recognition as a tractor company, it was a totally new face in the construction world.\nNonetheless, the quality and innovation of the brand quickly stood out from the rest, leading it to become the best-selling compact excavator* in the world.\n*Kubota is the world\u2019s #1 selling compact\u00a0excavator\u00a0for 18 years.\"\nDisclaimer:\u00a0According to 2021 data from Off-Highway Research including all Kubota Group brand sales.\nThis unique cutaway B8200 tractor model was commissioned by Kubota Tractor Corporation in the 1980s, likely soon after the model was first introduced in 1982. To allow for greater insight and understanding during educational training sessions, this B8200\nwas made with strategic cutouts that reveal parts of the tractor that were normally hidden from view.\nKubota introduced its first radio-controlled mower, the PX2100 concept, with four-wheel drive and crab steer in the late 1980s. It was a step out of the norm for Kubota\u2014it was purely built as a proof of concept and demonstration of design and innovation\nprowess for Kubota.\nThe BX Series opened a new class for the industry. Some customers really liked the B Series but either couldn't afford it or wanted the maneuverability of a garden tractor. The BX Series offered a better solution because the BX was capable of doing almost\neverything a compact tractor could do, but with easy operation and hydrostatic power steering. The BX2200 and the BX1800 were the first models.\nThe ZD Series zero-turn mowers were designed for professional operational performance and durability.\nThe RTV900, Kubota\u2019s first utility vehicle, was designed and developed in response to requests from dealers who felt there was a market for it. It combined proven tractor features with excellent hydraulic engineering, Kubota diesel technology and\na perfectly matched Kubota hydrostatic transmission.\nIn the 1960s, McCulloch ordered 100 G-12 and 100 D-20 tractors from Kubota to be sold in the United States. The 200 tractors ordered by McCulloch were ultimately unsuccessful, but this setback later proved to be a blessing in disguise. A team of Kubota\nemployees were sent to follow up with each and every store where the McCulloch tractors had been sold. Their efforts confirmed that there was a market for Kubota tractors, which could perform heavy-duty work that other garden tractors available in\nthe country could not. Based on these findings, Kubota made the decision to move forward with expansion into the United States with Marubeni as the company\u2019s direct distributor.\nSoon after Kubota Tractor Corporation was created, the L225 was released. While Kubota was a small, unknown brand back then, the compact size of the tractors set Kubota apart from the rest of the United States tractor market. This presented both a challenge\nand an opportunity.\nPreceded by the M4000, M4500 and M5500 models, the M7500 was the fourth tractor released in the M Series line.

Company leaders from around the world came together to provide attendees with an immersive experience into the future for its next generation of equipment that will seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence, automation, and electrification.\n\u201cKubota is transforming from a trusted equipment provider into a solutions provider,\u201d said Todd Stucke, Kubota Executive Officer and newly appointed president of Kubota Tractor Corporation. \u201cWe are well known in the compact equipment market for our versatility, durability, and reliability, and our machines have always been easy to own and easy to operate. Today, they\u2019re evolving to be even more intuitive, putting data and AI directly in the hands of residential equipment owners to enhance their lives and make things easier, more productive, and more efficient.\u201d\nKubota unveiled the New Agri Concept \u2013 a fully electric, multi-purpose vehicle \u2013 and released an immersive video illustrating Kubota\u2019s vision for bringing autonomous technology and AI together to provide solutions for a residential or small-acreage grower. Key technologies highlighted in the immersive video include: automatic data collection, real-time monitoring, AI identifying potential issues, automation addressing labor challenges, water management automation, and a data platform enhancing productivity.\nThe fully electric New Agri Concept is designed for flexibility and to support a wide range of tasks. The vehicle\u2019s six independent drive motors and a standard three-point hitch allow it to use many existing implements for common operations including mowing and tilling. Fast charging from 10% to 80% in less than six minutes enables flexibility by not constraining customers with long charge times, reduces vehicle downtime, and allows the vehicle to quickly get back to work when in operation. Electric drives enable quiet operation making the New Agri Concept easy to operate in residential settings or at night.\n\u201cI am excited to help unveil our New Agri Concept, which showcases our design philosophy and builds on Kubota\u2019s long legacy of technology innovation for the betterment of society,\u201d said Senior Technologist for Kubota North America Brett McMickell. \u201cThis concept vehicle, as shown in the immersive video, displays the future potential of fusing digital and physical to provide complete solutions for our customers. Many technologies, such as AI, connectivity, and autonomy, need to come together in order to realize Kubota\u2019s vision of providing solutions across the food value chain \u2013 from growers to consumers.
