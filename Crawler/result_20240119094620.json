        "raw_content": "The Spoon\nDaily news and analysis about the food tech revolution\nYo-Kai to Debut Boba Making Robot at CES 2024\nIn less than two weeks, Yo-Kai Express, a company that\u2019s become synonymous with hot ramen-making robots, will show it has a sweet side with the debut of a boba-making robot at CES in Las Vegas.\nYo-Kai CEO Andy Lin told The Spoon that the company\u2019s new robotic boba maker will be the first boba-bot that incorporates a cooking pot inside the appliance, enabling it to cook boba tapioca pearls as well as other toppings. According to Lin, the machine\u2019s built-in cooking capability will allow it to be more than just a boba-maker, enabling it to create a variety of different hot and cold beverages and meals ranging from instant oatmeal to protein shakes to soups and coffees.\nThe first machine will be shipped to Netflix\u2019s headquarters in Los Gatos, California. After that, Lin says that distribution will be a phased release with around ten boba-bots shipped to other corporate headquarters in the Bay Area. Another shipment in March will put the Yo-Kai boba machine at college campuses and other locations, and starting in June, the Yo-Kai boba-bot will be widely available to individual operators who want to operate a Yo-Kai.\nAnd it\u2019s with this wider availability that Yo-Kai will begin a new expansion approach that will extend beyond its current operating model. Lin says that in 2024, the company plans to phase its expansion model into one utilizing a partner model where individual operators will pay an initial startup fee to Yo-Kai, and from there, they will be able to take ownership of the boba and begin operating it. Lin says that the model, which is \u201cfranchise-like\u201d, will offer new operators a choice of up to 1,500 different locations that Yo-Kai has helped find through a new strategic partnership with a large real estate management company.\n\u201cUsually, if a partner wants to open a boba store, they need to find a location by themselves,\u201d said Lin. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need them to find a location; we can actually provide a location to them. So it will be a one-stop-shop: Go to the website, select the region you want to have the machine, and we will work together with them.\u201d\nWhile the Yo-Kai boba-bot certainly isn\u2019t the first automated boba-making machine, no other company has had much success in expanding beyond initial pilots and trials. Bobacino, which debuted in 2020, saw its CEO depart last month, and it\u2019s not clear if the company is still operational. Cloutea, which debuted its boba robot at CES 2023, opened a store in Las Vegas this past April but has not expanded beyond a single location.\nThe new Yo-Kai boba robot will debut at CES, which starts on January 9th and runs through January 12th. The new boba bot will be featured in the food tech area on the show floor in the Venetian Expo Hall at CES.\nStay tuned to The Spoon for more food tech coverage at CES over the next two weeks.\nGet The Spoon in Your Inbox\nRelated\nGet the Spoon in your inbox\nJust enter your email and we\u2019ll take care of the rest:\nFind us on some of these other platforms:\nPost navigation\nReader Interactions\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Chef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u2019t need to cook \u2014 or mix drinks \u2014 for themselves anymore.\nThere was plenty new in the food and beverage world at CES 2024, the multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association. Displays included a cocktail-mixing machine akin to a Keurig, and a robot barista whose movements are meant to mimic a human making a vanilla latte.\nHere\u2019s some of the newest tech that\u2019s transforming the way meals are prepped, cooked and delivered:\nONE TOUCH IS ALL IT TAKES\nTech startup Chef AI is unveiling what it calls a \u201creal one-touch\u201d air fryer.\nUnlike the air fryer you might have on your kitchen counter right now, Chef AI\u2019s iteration of the popular appliance doesn\u2019t require any tinkering with settings. Just place the food in the air fryer, press Start, and it uses artificial intelligence to detect what type of food it is cooking, says the company\u2019s CEO, Dean Khormaei.\nHe said the air fryer would turn even the worst cooks into chefs.\nChef AI will be available in the U.S. in September for $250.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL BARTENDER\nWhat\u2019s the secret to a perfect dirty martini? Don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 Bartesian\u2019s cocktail-mixing appliance takes the guesswork out of bartending.\nBartesian\u2019s latest iteration, the Premier, can hold up to four different types of spirits. It retails for $369 and will be available later this year.\nUse a small touch screen on the appliance to pick from 60 recipes, drop a cocktail capsule into the machine, and in seconds you have a premium cocktail over ice.\nIf you fancy a homemade beer instead, iGulu\u2019s new automated brewing machine lets you make your own beer \u2014 a pale ale, an amber lager or a wheat beer. Just pour a pre-mixed recipe into the machine\u2019s keg, add water and scan the sticker that comes with the beer mix. In nine to 13 days, you\u2019ll have a gallon of DIY beer.\nROBOT BARISTA THAT MOVES LIKE YOU MOVE\nArtly Coffee\u2019s barista bot mimics the way a human behind the counter of your favorite coffee shop might prepare your usual order.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do is preserve the craft of fine coffee,\u201d said Alec Roig, a hardware developer for the Seattle-based tech startup that now is operating at 10 locations across the Pacific Northwest and in New York City.\nRoig said the company\u2019s resident barista, who is behind all of Artly\u2019s coffee recipes, was hooked up with motion sensors that recorded his movements as he prepared each recipe, from packing the coffee grounds into the filter to frothing the milk and pouring latte art.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report.\nMost Popular\nScene on the Sun\nEntertainment:\nSteelheart brings power balladry to Las Vegas\nEntertainment:\nLas Vegas Magazine Hall of Fame 2024: Omega Mart\nNightlife:\nPeek inside Chez Bippy, Las Vegas' newest speakeasy\nFeatured Galleries\nProcession for CCSD Officer Andrew\u00a0Craft\nMartin Luther King Jr.\u00a0Parade\nGolden Knights Defeat Nashville Predators,\u00a04-1\nMore photos \u00bb\nAP Headlines\nFollow us:\n\u00a9 Las Vegas Sun, 2024, All Rights Reserved"

OrCam, another innovative company, unveiled a range of devices designed to help individuals with hearing loss manage auditory overload. Sony, on the other hand, presented its Access controller for PlayStation, which caters to individuals with accessibility needs in gaming.\nAnother prevalent theme at CES 2024 was the integration and connectivity between smart devices, homes, and vehicles. Leading tech companies such as Samsung, Google, and Amazon showcased their efforts to create a seamless ecosystem where devices can interact and collaborate. Samsung's focus on 'AI for all' led to the integration of its smart home devices and appliances, enabling them to perform tasks in harmony. For example, selecting a recipe on one device can automatically trigger pre-heating in the oven. Google expanded the capabilities of Chromecast, allowing it to work with more apps and devices. Meanwhile, Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard, aiming to enhance interoperability among different smart devices. The automotive industry also joined this trend, as Mercedes-Benz introduced an AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize driver-car interactions.\nCES 2024 saw significant advancements in the field of vehicles and mobility solutions. Electric vehicles took center stage, with companies like Honda unveiling their concept cars for a new global EV series. Kia took a modular approach by introducing three electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to adapt their functionality. Vietnamese electric startup VinFast showcased an electric truck concept, representing their commitment to sustainable transportation. Notably, hydrogen-powered vehicles also received attention, with Bosch Mobility and Hyundai showcasing their hydrogen energy solutions. Hyundai also impressed with an AI-based autonomous construction excavator, demonstrating their dedication to innovation across industries.\nFor those who enjoy culinary delights, CES 2024 brought exciting developments in kitchen technology. Companies like GE showcased innovative appliances that allow users to smoke food indoors, while Brisk presented a smart grill powered by generative AI, making outdoor barbecuing foolproof. ColdSnap introduced an ice cream machine that can prepare frozen treats in just two minutes, significantly reducing waiting times. Additionally, Bartesian's cocktail-mixing appliance took mixology to the next level, offering a selection of 60 different drinks at the touch of a button.\nThe world of television also witnessed remarkable advancements at CES 2024. The introduction of OLED, Micro LED, and 8k technologies resulted in exceptionally sharp and clear images. However, the most fascinating TVs displayed at the event were the transparent screens presented by LG and Samsung. When turned off, LG's 77-inch transparent OLED screen becomes almost invisible, while Samsung's transparent MICRO LED-powered display operates similarly. These transparent TVs can also double as digital canvases, perfect for showcasing artwork when not in use.\nCES 2024 was a testament to the incredible innovations that continue to shape our everyday lives. From assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities to interconnected smart devices, the showcased tech solutions demonstrated the industry's commitment to solving real-world problems and enriching our experiences. As we move forward, it is evident that technology will play a critical role in transforming various aspects of our lives, making them more accessible, interconnected, and exciting."

The best of it aimed to solve big real-world problems. Some of it aimed to make your life more fun. And some of it was just a little out there.\nAssociated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.\nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what caught our eye at CES 2024.\nACCESSIBILITY PRODUCTS WERE BIG ON HOPE\nAt a conference where excess and opulence manifested itself in nearly everything, it was encouraging to see how much progress has been made toward developing assistive technologies for the disabled.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patients and those with hand tremors regain control of their lives. Dutch startup Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI to give people with vocal impairments a chance to have real-time conversations in their own natural voices. OrCam introduced a host of devices designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. And Sony reserved some prime space in its booth to showcase its Access controller for PlayStation.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEARLY EVERYTHING\nUsing software and AI to achieve inter-device connections between smart devices, your home and even your car was central to many of the biggest tech companies at CES 2024.\nSamsung's new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI for all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mantra meant integrating its smart home devices and appliances to perform tasks in unison \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like the act of recipe selection automatically pre-heating your oven. The South Korean tech giant also announced a collaboration with Hyundai to develop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home-to-car\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153car-to-home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd services for all Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Google is expanding Chromecast to more apps and devices. And Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard to create more inter-operability between smart devices.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize interactions between drivers and their cars.\nVEHICLES ADVANCES WERE ON FULL DISPLAY\nCES 2024 was brimming with new electric vehicles, remote construction vehicles, hydrogen engines and other mobility advances.\nHonda premiered two concept cars, dubbed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saloon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Space-Hub,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a new global EV series. Kia decided to go modular with a trio of electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to change their functionality. And Vietnam-based electric upstart VinFast unveiled an electric truck concept.\nBosch Mobility and Hyundai both doubled down on hydrogen as an energy solution. And Hyundai showcased its AI-based autonomous construction excavator.\nHOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to cook \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or mix drinks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for themselves anymore.\nGE wants you to start smoke food indoors, while generative AI is powering a Brisk smart grill that aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but ColdSnap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new ice cream machine prepares your frozen treat in two minutes. And Bartesian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cocktail-mixing appliance can make as many as 60 different kinds of drinks for you.\nWHAT'S NEW ON TV?\nOLED, Micro LED, 8k ... what does it all mean? It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She did exactly what I was looking for, and my hair looks so health!!\nDo not get your nails done here. This review is based on nails only. Cannot do dip powder at all even tho they advertise they can. It came out very thick and uneven. Kept informing her it looks unacceptable but she is unaware of how to fix it. Completely unknowledgeable of how to do nails.\nAlso it took 2.5 hours. I have been getting my nails done for the last 15 years and this is the worst place I've ever been to\nSusan helped me today doing a great hair cut!. She has great skills. I was able to communicate what I need and she was able to translate my needs smoothly\nI came in for a basic manicure and pedicure and it was not very good. From the start, I noticed some issues. My friend had scheduled appointments for us, without realizing there is only one nail technician here. We didn't mind having different appointment times though. When I arrived for my appointment (scheduled an hour after my friend's), the technician was not ready for me. I was thinking she had to finish my friend's nails, but she hadn't done her pedicure yet or finished her nails... Most everything here just felt rushed. It was strange because the services took a long time, but the quality was that with half the effort, rushed and not giving full quality. The salon area was not very clean, with tools and supplies strewn about randomly. The technician that did my nails wore gloves but got up and touched several surfaces in the middle of my pedicure.The manicure/pedicure were decent but the polish quality and application just were not good. The polish color was gorgeous but it was bumpy had a rough application. I suspect old nail polish but I am not sure. After my manicure, I looked at my cuticles and was shocked at how bad they looked; really disappointed since I always come out of nail services with the basics like that done perfectly!My friend was also not satisfied with her SNS. She expressed concern during the service but was ignored, resulting in wonky tips, uneven application, and bumpy texture. Her pedicure was rushed and she was not able to get the service she asked for. We made our appointments ahead of time with notice of the services we wanted and we did not mind waiting, but it was just not worth the time spent in this salon.I would not return here and would not recommend it to others.\nManicure - cuticles look terrible\nDO NOT GO THERE! GOT CHEMICAL BURNS ON MY SCALP! Long story short: I went in to bleach my hair and ended up with painful chemical burns all over my scalp. I went Illusions Salon to get my hair all bleached to white. My stylist was Brian. I've bleached my hair and my roots before so I know what to expect and to be clear, I never had a bad reaction to bleach before. The appointment for the most part went okay. One warning sign was that he piled up a lot of bleach directly on my scalp/roots and left it for quite too long, which may have caused the damage. However, when I came home I noticed the chemical burns all over my scalp. They were on top of, on the sides, and at the back of my head. There were red blisters, yellow and brown gunk and crust, and some parts were broken. Some parts were even oozing with white liquid (same puss that's in the pimples!) I attached the photos. They are also taking a very long time to heal.It's been a week or two and they still haven't gone away, they are still all over my head. These chemical burns are a serious medical injury that requires care and attention. It causes a very high risk of an infection. I am currently seeking care from a doctor to treat them. I texted Brian the photos of the burns and explained my situation with the chemical burns, asking for a refund. Brian behaved extremely unprofessional. He didn't offer any apology and didn't even awknowledge the chemical burns. Instead of an apology and awknowledging the problem, he said how the appointment took a long time and it was MY fault for not speaking up during the appointment. He also did not want to give a full refund at first. That was incredibly rude. If you make a mistake, you should awknowledge it and apologize for it, and offer some reimbursement (refund or treatment). As a hair stylist, you yourself are responsible for customer's safety and should know how to use dangerous chemicals properly. So the way that Brian acted was incredibly unprofessional and disrespectful. He is unqualified to do both hair and be the manager. Thankfully I did receive the refundI attached screenshots of the message with the stylist and photos of the scalp burns (there were many more). Please avoid this salon at all costs! I reccomend instead going to Noufal Color Studios in Tyson's, they are very professional and have never done any damage.\nSee all photos from Maria A. for Illusions Hair Salon & Spa\nI'm not even going to give any stars on this establishment. I had a gel pedicure and manicure with dip powder appointment for 11am today. It took the nail tech 3 hours to do my nails and was horrible!\nWorst manicure I've ever had done and it turned out horrible.\nI've never had to be at a salon for 3 hours for the same services!\nI told her i had a doctor's appointment at 2pm and needed to leave by 1:15 or 1:30 at the latest. I didn't get out of there until 2pm and my nails were still wet, even with blow drying them for 10 minutes,\nwhich I've never had to do before with a dip manicure and I still have marks in the polish!\nSo disgusted with the service. And the equipment in the nail area was old, didn't work and the fabric was ripped on the chairs. The place just seemed so run-down.\nThe tech was very disorganized and i believe now that she doesn't know what she's doing as I've never had it done that way before. So many steps seemed to be missed. Then add insult to injury in that I was charged $107 for this hot mess!\nIf I wasn't running so late I would have stayed to complain more but honestly it didn't seem anyone was interested as they heard me saying I needed to leave. I will never go here again!!!!\nImage of horrible manicure\nI called to get a last minute haircut because the place I normally go was booked and my hair was in desperate need of a haircut. I was nervous about getting a haircut at Illusions after reading some of the reviews. However, the salon agreed to take a same day appt., which I appreciated. I told them I just wanted a trim. I ended up seeing Nahid and when she saw my hair, she recommended that I get 2 inches cut off. She suggested long layers. I was still unsure, but she did a fantastic job on the haircut and blow dry/styling. My hair looks great! It looks so much healthier and I've gotten a ton of compliments.\nI tried this small salon in Brambleton hoping for a good experience. I think it is a better place for a guy. More like a barber shop. Only 2 chairs. No one else in salon but me and a lady sweeping up. Guy started off telling me assumptions about my hair that weren't true. Wrong color. Shampoo was very rough, water down my back. And he stopped in between cutting my hair to answer the phone a few times. I left wet. He charged top dollar. And asked for a tip but I didn't think you were supposed to tip the owner. Told me he would fix color when I said I didn't like it. I called two days later and said I wanted a redo, and the lady who answered said no.... To try it for two weeks and let it fade it would be fine. What? So be ugly for 2 weeks and you'll like it later. I told him I didn't want that color to start. That's not right. I wish I could get my money back. Paid over $100 for that kind of service? I ended up buying a box of blonde to put my own highlights in just to stand looking in the mirror and being seen til I found another stylist/salon and a time I could get away from work. Not cool. And I'm not that hard to please. Found a new salon and stylist and she nailed it the first try. Lovely people and wonderful shampoo at GlowStudio in Ashburn.\nAlso to update.\nI had my hair done two weeks ago and the grays are popping at my roots and the color is extremely washed out looking. Granted it was temporary but so was told a couple of months. For 315.00 I expect more longevity.\nI have been going here since I moved to NoVa in 2017.\nThis last visit left me looking for another place to get my color and cuts from. I have left this establishment before for the same reason but wanted to give it another try as they are really nice and I live so close to the salon.The color is horrible. I asked for a deep auburn with warm ginger balayage and got a flat, no dimension ugly auburn.\nThe cut is the worse part though. He said he would start off on the longer side of the cut and we could go from there.\nNope he went SHORT and it's the worse cut I have ever had.\nIt looks like a middle school girl's cut from Great Clips. I'd also add that he dyed the little peach fuzz on the side of my face and I had to wax it off.\nI know it's bad when he didn't even take a picture. He has always taken a picture of the final product but not this time and I can see why. This was the last straw for me. For over 300.00 and for this, I will go somewhere else. Dissatisfied and disappointed.\nRead more\nI came into this salon 2 years ago with horrible purple color in my hair hoping to get back to normal. Brian brought my hair back to a normal color and it looked awesome. Today he did an amazing shampoo cut and style.
