        "raw_content": "KIA's concept EV fleet revealed at CES 2024 is wildly modular\nKia on Monday unveiled plans at CES 2024 to create a line of modular electric vehicles (EVs) designed for adaptability and versatility in the hopes of changing the way we buy and use vehicles in the future.\nThe Korean car manufacturer outlined three phases as part of its Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV) strategy. Central to this strategy are interchangeable \"life modules,\" allowing a single vehicle to serve multiple roles \u2013 from a taxi to a delivery van or a personal recreational vehicle \u2013 by swapping out these modules as needed.\nLife modules are swappable and not fixed during manufacturing. Kia states that these modules can be connected to the base vehicle using a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in the vehicle's use.\nWhile the Kia didn't specify the cost, it implies that vehicle functionality can be continuously reconfigured. This strategy is part of Kia's broader vision to focus on advanced technologies like software integration, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence.\nKia says phase one starts with the Concept PV5, the first in the series. This EV is imagined as the workhorse of the fleet, focusing on providing solutions for common mobility challenges and optimized for various major domains like hailing delivery, and utilities.\nThe Concept PV7 is the largest product in Kia's PBV line-up and is geared toward customers who need more space and range, possibly for longer journeys or larger cargo.\nFinally, there's the Concept PV1, the smallest in the PBV series, designed for agile and short-distance logistics transportation. It uses driving modules to minimize the turning radius, making it ideal for navigating in narrow spaces. Based on the concept videos Kia showed on Monday, the PV1 seems best suited for urban environments where space is limited and maneuverability is crucial.\nIn the second phase of Kia's strategy, the PBV lineup will integrate the use of AI that leverages data to interact with users and keep its devices and software up-to-date.\nThe third phase sees these vehicles adding features like autonomous driving and more.\nKia plans on producing 150,000 of these vehicles annually until 2025, afterward increasing production to 300,000 annually.\nTopics\nElectric Vehicles\nSelf-Driving Cars\nCars\nCurrently residing in Austin, Texas, Chance Townsend is an Assistant Editor at Mashable.

        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

        "raw_content": "Kia Unveils Five New Electric Commercial Vehicle Concepts At CES 2024\nThe Korean automaker wants to lead the commercial segment with its innovative PV1, PV5, and PV7 vehicles.\nKia has introduced five new concepts at CES 2024, showcasing the brand's direction regarding electromobility. The quintet of EVs are classified as Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV) solutions and will cater to the commercial sector and customers with specific mobility requirements.\nLeading the charge is the Concept PV5, a modular vehicle that can be tailored to the user's needs. Four PV5-based designs have been previewed, mirroring future models. In the coming years, Kia intends to introduce several body styles, which include a 'Basic' model, Chassis Cab, High Roof, and Van derivatives. Later, the Korean automaker hopes to introduce an autonomous Robotaxi version, designed in collaboration with Motional, a self-driving subsidiary of Hyundai.\nAll four PV5 concepts boast large doors that make it easier for occupants to enter and exit the cabin. Loading the vehicle with items should be a cinch. The lengthy wheelbase and flat floor further enhance this.\nKia says the design of its PBVs extends beyond aesthetics. The future lineup of electric vehicles has been designed to be \"robust, simple, and clever tools.\" This is evident in the boxy, no-nonsense styling that puts practicality at the forefront. Kia has cleverly engineered the \"weldless' body structure to accommodate an array of structures or interchangeable upper bodies.\nThese bodies, or, as Kia calls them, life modules, will be connected to the vehicle with hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology. For example, a Kia PBV could serve as a taxi during the day and moonlight as a delivery or family vehicle after hours.\nKia PBVs will be introduced in three phases, with the PV5 being the first to arrive. These vehicles are expected to debut with sophisticated tech that would allow PBVs to connect with each other and share delivery and route information - a nifty feature in crowded cities.\nThe PV7 and PV1 are expected to arrive as part of Phase 2. The former is described as the largest vehicle in the lineup and boasts an impressive driving range, superior cabin space, and superior features and functions. On the other end of the scale, we have the adorable PV1.\nThis diminutive tyke may not be as spacious as its larger brothers, but it has been designed for short distances and is reportedly very agile, thanks to the small turning circle. The PV1 should be a boon in crowded European and Asian metropoles. We don't expect it to reach American shores, but there could be plenty of interest in the PV7, especially as a potential rival to the Ford E-Transit and Mercedes eSprinter.\nKia won't sell these purpose-built vehicles alongside EVs like the EV6 GT and EV9. Instead, the automaker will develop a dedicated business system that will handle everything from the PBV lineup to software and purchasing.\nAll PBV vehicles will be equipped with a rail system on the floor, side panels, and ceilings; this allows each vehicle to be customized to the user's needs and means goods can be seamlessly transferred from one vehicle to another.\nProduction of the PBV vehicles will kick off in 2025 at a new plant at the Hwaseong site in South Korea. Initially, the automaker hopes to produce around 100,000 vehicles annually, with plans to increase this to 150,000 units.\n\"The Kia PBV business is the pinnacle of our customer-centric business approach. With the aim of developing PBVs and solutions tailored to their business environments, we are confident that these strong partnerships will be a driving force on the road to becoming a sustainable mobility solutions provider,\" commented Pierre-Martin Bos, VP and Director of PBV.\nKia has previously said these new vehicles will use the eS skateboard platform. Eventually, we can expect an array of vehicles, including those large enough to serve as mobile offices or stores."

If and when the PV5 becomes reality, Kia intends to release it with various modules, including a van body, a high roof, and a chassis cab. Kia eventually plans to introduce a robotaxi model of the PV5 as well.\nCabs on PBV vehicles will be fixed, but the rest of the body (excluding the all-important EV skateboard the entire platform is built on) will be able to be swapped out and secured with hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical couplings. Features will be shareable \"across all vehicles,\" Kia said.\nFrankly, it's about time someone came up with such a concept given that EVs eliminate most of the fiddly mechanical bits from the body of automobiles and move them to the base.\n\"Kia's PBV business represents our vision of going beyond the traditional concept of automobiles by fulfilling the unmet needs of diverse customers and communities through optimized vehicles and services catering to specific market and business circumstances,\" said Kia president and CEO Ho Sung Song.\nPhasing in the future\nKia's PBV plans certainly appear more than just a concept as the company is already developing a PBV-dedicated plant in Hwaseong, Korea, to build the vehicles. Expected to come online in 2025, the factory is forecast to pump out 150,000 units once it reaches production capacity.\nWith that in mind, Kia said it plans to implement its PBV strategy in three phases, starting with the introduction of the PV5 \u2013 but not much else.\nThe second phase is where things begin to get interesting as that's when Kia said it'll complete its PBV model lineup, including the introduction of the PV1 and PV7, the latter of which will be equipped with a \"cabinet and frame\" system designed to simplify the transportation of goods.\n\"An integrated rail system on the vehicle's ceiling, floor, and side panels, as well as on the exterior, enables customization of the vehicle to meet individual customer needs,\" Kia said.\nHow Kia envisions the PV7's track system being used\nPhase two will also include \"PBVs evolving into AI-based mobility platforms that use data to interact with users and help keep vehicles updated,\" Kia said. This will include an \"integrated PBV solution\" that provides a unified user experience across devices and hardware.\nFar from being standalone modular vehicles, Kia reckons that in phase three the PBV lineup will evolve into a connected system \"by integrating with the future mobility ecosystem\" that the company is building for its PBV world.\nPart of that will be a fleet management tool that connects PBVs to a central control point, enabling things like charging schedule optimization that accounts for routes and driver breaks. Vehicle inventory monitoring, temperature control, and route planning features will all be part of the suite as well.\nLest you think Kia forgot about the current tech buzzwords, \"real-time data and AI integration for predictive maintenance and optimal operational efficiency\" was mentioned as well.\nKia has already established agreements with Uber, Dubai Taxi Corporation, Kakao Mobility, and others to develop additional business-centric features for the PBV fleet.\n\"We are confident that these strong partnerships will be a driving force on the road to becoming a sustainable mobility solutions provider,\" said PBV group director Pierre-Martin Bos.\nWhile Kia declined to include any technical details, or share them with us directly, a spokesperson told The Register that the first PV5s should be available sometime next year following completion of the Hwaseong factory. The new vehicles will initially be manufactured in Korea, though we're told Kia would like to have its PBVs available across Asia, North America, and Europe. \u00ae\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nSend us news\nOther stories you might like\nThe Register\nBiting the hand that feeds IT\nCopyright.

EVAR has won five innovation awards for two consecutive years since 2022, drawing attention from the industry.\n\u201cSmart EV Charger 2023\u201d which EVAR will introduce together, is the industry\u2019s first slow charger equipped with a smart fire detection solution. When a fire is detected, the device can immediately stop charging and send a fire alarm to a control center connected to the server to speed up the initial response to electric vehicle fires. In addition, Bluetooth BT PnC (Bluetooth Plug and Charge) technology has implemented an application or card-free charging experience to enhance user convenience.\nCurrently, EVAR is rapidly growing on the global stage. After supplying its products to Canada in June 2022, it recently signed a business agreement with Blink Charging Co., a Nasdaq-listed company in the U.S., to discuss cooperation in supplying home and public chargers starting in South America by 2024. Blink Charging Co. is an electric vehicle charging service company that contracts and supplies 85,000 charging ports worldwide and operates charging stations.\nFor inquiries and connections with Korean tech companies mentioned in this article, contact us at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].

        "raw_content": "Kia reinvents the van with its electric Platform Beyond Vehicles\nKia wants to build EVs that can be easily reconfigured for different uses, ranging from ordinary passenger cars to taxis and delivery vehicles. The automaker previewed this strategy, called the Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), at CES 2024, showing the first potential vehicle designs.\nAll PBV derivatives will be based on a modular platform with a fixed cab, but all bodywork aft of the cab will be interchangeable, allowing the same vehicle to serve as a taxi during the day, a delivery van at night, and a personal car on weekends, Kia says. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Kia first mentioned the PBV strategy in April 2023, but at that time, the acronym stood for \u201cPurpose-Built Vehicle.\u201d\nThe rear bodywork, which Kia calls the \u201clife module,\u201d is connected to the chassis via electromagnetic and mechanical couplings. These modules will be shipped in kit form and designed to be easily assembled outside a factory setting. Kia says they\u2019ll incorporate features like large doors to make ingress and egress easy, adding that the basic EV platform creates a large flat floor ideal for stowing cargo.\nAt CES, Kia showed the Concept PV5, previewing the first planned PBV production model. Kia plans to offer \u201cbasic,\u201d van, high roof, and chassis cab configurations, as well as a self-driving version for a planned autonomous ride-hailing service from Motional, a joint venture between Kia parent Hyundai and autonomous-driving tech firm Aptiv.\nThe PV5 will be followed by a larger model called the PV7 and a smaller model called the PV1. They\u2019ll be built at a dedicated factory in Hwaseong, South Korea, that\u2019s scheduled to open in 2025 and will be able to build 150,000 vehicles per year, according to Kia.\nIn addition to the vehicles themselves, Kia hopes to create an aftermarket ecosystem of accessories that can be mounted on a standardized rail system built into the ceiling, floor, and side panels of the vehicles. According to Kia, this can accommodate everything from cabinets and shelves to speakers, and the automaker plans to contract with conversion shops in different markets to install them. There will also be bundles of software, including fleet management systems for the commercial operators likely to use the PBVs in their delivery van, taxi, and autonomous ride-hailing configurations.\nThe multiple body styles, range of accessories installed by third-party firms, and fleet-management software all seem borrowed from the commercial van market. But commercial vans also seem like a better model for the delivery vehicles and ride-hailing of the future than the hodgepodge of sedans and SUVs doing the majority of Uber or GrubHub runs today.\nTo date, electric vehicles have cost considerably more than their gasoline-powered counterparts, but that\u2019s finally changing. Every year, more and more inexpensive EVs are hitting the market and, with the help of local, state, and federal tax credits and rebates (if available), many of them now sell for well below the 2023 median car price of $48,000.\nIf you're a budget-conscious buyer, that number is probably little consolation. However, there are a lot of good options for closer to $30,000 and below -- if you know where to look. That's why we've put together this guide. Here's a list of the nine most affordable electric vehicles available right now, ranked from cheapest to most expensive. Note that we're only including vehicles that are available in the U.S.\nElectric cars aren't just an opportunity for automakers to be friendlier to the planet. They're an opportunity to try something new. That's what Volvo is doing with its new EX30 crossover SUV.\nThe EX30 essentially represents a third stage of evolution for Volvo's EVs. The Swedish automaker started with the XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge, two EVs based on an existing internal-combustion architecture. It then showed the EX90, which was designed from the ground up as an EV, but in the image of the gasoline-powered Volvo XC90. Now, we get to see what an EV can look like with all the gasoline baggage shed.\n2024 BMW i5 BMW\nThe new 2024 BMW 5 Series is two cars in one. On one hand, there's the eighth-generation gasoline-powered sedan that will represent the bulk of sales in most markets. On the other hand, for the first time in the nameplate's long history, there's an electric version called i5.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "The 7 Best EV Prototypes and Car Concepts From CES 2024\nAutomakers looked to the future at CES 2024, with eye-catching concept EVs and intriguing, AI-infused cabin redesigns that could change the way we drive in the years to come.\nEVs and car technology were a big focus at CES 2024, where new and established brands debuted their visions for the future of driving. Ideas ran the gamut: Fast-charging batteries, wall-to-wall dash screens featuring games and movies, celebrity sound system collaborations, modular vehicles, and even electric RVs. Here are the five best prototypes and concepts from the show that could revolutionize the roads in the years to come.\n1. Honda '0 Series' Concept EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new EV lineup, the \u201c0 Series.\" Two futuristic concept vehicles were on display: the Saloon, a sedan, and the Space-Hub, which is somewhat of a living room mixed with an SUV. In 2026, the production version of the concept EVs will hit dealers. Honda is promising a thin, lightweight battery that\u2019s made in Ohio and thus tax credit-eligible. It will have less than 10% range loss after 10 years of driving and eventually a 10- to 15-minute charge time, though that won\u2019t be available in 2026 and will come later.\n2. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBVs)\nKia announced its ambitious plan to make cars that can be repurposed as a home office, complete with a steering wheel that becomes a lamp when rotated up. It then illuminates the dash, which becomes a desk. The new line, dubbed Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBVs), can go from a home office to a delivery van or personal vehicle in the same day, thanks to its universal base and internal rail system.\nThe PBVs are likely decades away from becoming a reality, but Kia already started building a factory for them. They\u2019ll go to businesses first, then consumers. If Kia can pull off the plan, the PBVs could create a new mobility category for smart cities and sustainability-minded consumers who want to find new ways to use their vehicles.\n3. Mercedes Concept CLA Class Entry-Level EV\nThe Mercedes Concept CLA Class made its North American debut at CES this year, though it was first announced in September 2023. It has 466 miles of range, can charge 248 miles in just 15 minutes, and will eventually hit dealers as an entry-level EV. Mercedes has not confirmed a price yet. But if it's around $40,000, it would be a serious competitor to the Tesla Model 3 ($39,000 starting) with a more upscale interior.\nAt the show, Mercedes announced it will integrate more AI into its in-car voice tech, the MBUX Voice Assistant. Drivers can expect natural language conversations thanks to the assistant's four emotional profiles. It will also learn the driver's routines and preferences to automatically turn on the A/C on a hot day, flip to a news channel in the morning, or turn on the seat massagers at night.\nGiant screens remain a focus for Mercedes, but what to watch? At CES, it debuted an immersive musical experience created with will.i.am, as well as support for more subscription games, movies, and podcasts through a partnership with Amazon and Audible.\n4. LG Chip: More ADAS, Infotainment\nEvery year we see more advanced autonomous driving and in-vehicle infotainment tech, and at CES, LG Electronics introduced a new chip, developed in partnership with Magna, that it plans to sell it to OEMs at an affordable price. This small piece of hardware has an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and an array of infotainment tech. For example, it will make it easier for car companies to offer head-up displays, a small digital cluster on the windshield that shows the car's current speed, navigation, and other key information. This is an up-and-coming safety feature that's currently only on a few vehicles, but LG's chip could help it become more common in the next few years.\n5. Hisense Head-Up Display Projector\nHisense is also working to revolutionize head-up displays with its in-vehicle laser projection technology. If car companies opt for it in their upcoming vehicles, we can expect head-up displays to get a lot crisper, brighter, and more visually interesting. The new system offers 48% higher color performance than LEDs, is 80% smaller than \"traditional optical solutions,\" and has 200% more luminous efficiency. It also comes with Hisense's Laser Holographic augmented reality technology, which promises to \"seamlessly blend virtual and real-world elements, turning the windshield into a vast holographic screen for safer driving.\"\nRecommended by Our Editors\n6. BMW Remote-Controlled Parking\nBMW is transforming remote-controlled cars from a toy for kids into an ultra-sophisticated real-world technology. At CES, it invited journalists out to the parking lot for a demo of a new level 4 automated parking solution (for reference, Tesla full-self driving is a level 2). \"The customer leaves the vehicle at a defined drop-off point,\" BMW says. \"From there, the vehicle automatically searches for a parking space, performs the necessary maneuvers to enter the space, and can return to the pick-up point. The underlying technology can be either an autonomous driving system or a remote-controlled valet system.\" The valet system would also work for parking at large events and airports, for example.\nAt CES, BMW also announced a new in-vehicle gaming system that allows you to wirelessly connect full-blown controllers to the dash. BMW's current in-vehicle gaming relies on a smartphone, but now drivers can have a typical console experience when the car is parked, including multi-player games.\n7. Lateral, Diagonal Driving With Hyundai Mobis\nYou might think you don't need to drive a car diagonally, but after seeing this demo from Hyundai Mobis you'll probably want to try it. Hyundai Mobis is an automotive supplier, a separate but related company to the Hyundai most are familiar with. The company debuted its \"eCorner System\" at CES, which turns each wheel independently at different angles. Theoretically, this could reinvent many aspects of driving, from parallel parking to doing donuts.\n\"In-Wheel technology involves placing four small motors inside each wheel, as opposed to the single large driving motor commonly used in EVs,\" says Lee Young-kook, VP and Head of the company's Electrification Lab. \"This configuration enables each wheel to generate its own power independently.\"\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Honda resets the EV clock to zero\nHonda's journey towards electrification hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. But at CES 2024, the Japanese company said it wants to remedy that by going back to \"the starting point of Honda as an automaker\". Essentially, it is ripping up its own rulebook and starting afresh.\nThe result is two stunning concepts, the 0 Series Saloon and Space-hub, both offering a glimpse at Honda\u2019s overarching design direction and EV philosophy.\nGlobal CEO Toshihiro Mibe says his company wants to move away from the \"thick and heavy\" electric cars of today and instead focus on a \"thin, light and wise\" philosophy.\nCut through the non-speak and Honda is looking towards the next generation of thinner and lighter battery packs to power its sleek, low and rakish Saloon, which is tipped to be very close to a production version and is promised to inherit the marque\u2019s 'joy of driving' spirit.\nThere\u2019s no word on range and performance, as it\u2019s likely still hypothetical, but both the Saloon and the people moving, lounge-like Space-Hub will both feature advanced driver assist systems, high levels of autonomous driving capabilities and, fingers crossed, some cutting-edge infotainment thanks to Honda\u2019s close ties with multimedia and entertainment giant Sony.\n2. BMW showcases AR driving\nBMW hosted demos of an Xreal Air 2-based augmented reality experience aboard a BMW iX at CES 2024 \u2013\u00a0and TechRadar\u2019s US Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff said that what he saw \"surprised and often delighted\" him.\nThat\u2019s high praise indeed, but rather than merely being a fun gimmick (BMW made it rain AR casino betting chips on our cruise around Las Vegas), it could also be a very handy extension of the navigation and infotainment system in general.\nWith the Xreal Air 2 glasses on, BMW is able to project driver information onto the real world outside the windscreen, with strobing 3D green arrows highlighting upcoming turns, and large red blocks warning when the driver is getting dangerously close to static objects.\nCurrently, the system is running through a smartphone that is connected to the car, but developers behind the tech want to make the entire experience wireless, opening it up to other brands of augmented reality glasses to make the experience as seamless as possible for potential customers.\nBut the ultimate party piece? Flip down the front sun visor and the system becomes an impressively sharp\u00a0private cinema. Perfect for whiling away the hours when charging modern EVs on a cripplingly slow public charging network.\n3. Kia pushes into electric vans\nKia's interpretation of PBV stands for \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicles\u2019, rather than the more commonly used 'purpose built vehicles', but either way this is its break into the electric commercial vehicle market.\nThe upcoming line-up comprises the PV1, PV5 and PV7, which showcase a range of sizes and applications, and span ideas that are very close to production, as well as those that are little more future-thinking.\nThe mid-sized PV5 is our best indication of what Kia\u2019s electric van will look like and its highly modular interior can be configured for a range of scenarios, be it last mile delivery or transporting the family in a ride-hailing service.\nOne of its key USPs is its software defined nature, which allows it to pass data from a central control room to the vehicle and vice versa, making it simple for operators to manage an entire fleet in real time, without the need for additional technology.\nAs we look into the future-gazing crystal ball, we will see fully autonomous versions and what Kia is calling 'Easy Swap' technology, which allows a single vehicle chassis to house multiple upper bodies, effectively transforming it from a cargo carrier to mobile office (and beyond) in minutes thanks to hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling tech.\n4. Mercedes reinvents your driving playlist\nIt was the CES innovation I really wanted to hate, but ended up becoming slightly smitten with, as Mercedes-Benz effectively turned its electric vehicles into musical instruments.\nThanks to Will.i.am and his team of talented developers, the Mercedes-Benz MBUX Sound Drive app deconstructs your favourite tracks and uses information from the vehicle, such as steering inputs, acceleration and braking, to create intriguing, live performance style remixes.\nYou can read our full hands-on MBUX experience for more details, but a quick test of the technology proved it was less a gimmicky way to kill a few minutes, and more a clever way to uniquely soundtrack an audibly-bereft electric vehicle. Hey, I don\u2019t even like The Black Eyed Peas, but MBUX Sound Drive made me reconsider my position.\n5. Harman turns car seats into speakers\nDubbed SeatSonic, Harman\u2019s passenger-centric audio system completely rethinks the in-car listening experience, with one Harman executive going so far as saying it also \"frees car designers from today\u2019s interior constraints\".\nWe\u2019re not sure how much design real estate is actually behind a door card, but the idea is solid, as it sees near-field transducers integrated into the headrests and a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seats for a viscerally bassy experience.\nThe sound quality is great, although the basic package, where speakers are only installed in the seats, can sound a little dull and distant. To combat this, Harman will offer additional tweeters that nestle beneath the windscreen for a much richer listen.\nBetter still, Harman says that because the audio doesn\u2019t have to travel as far, there is a 60 per cent power saving when compared to a conventional in-car audio set-up. That stuff makes a big difference in today\u2019s world of electric vehicles and range anxiety.\nHarman has been working with seat makers, as well as Tier 1 suppliers that produce automotive grade ventilation, heating and massaging tech, to integrate it into one neat, ready to rock package. So expect to see it go live soon.\n6. Mobion banishes awkward parking situations\nStick with us here, as this one gets a little weird. But Hyundai Mobis, a subsidiary of automotive giant Hyundai, offered a glimpse of a future where tricky parking situations are no more. The Mobion concept car, which is just a jazzy Hyundai Ioniq 5, features the company\u2019s In-Wheel motor technology and upcoming e-Corner drive system.\nHere, all four wheels are driven and can steer independently of one another. Motors in the wheels mean no axles, which frees up each corner to do as it pleases. Well, within reason.\nA live demonstration showed how Mobion can \u2018crab-walk\u2019, where all four wheels rotate 90-degrees and the car effectively performs a sideways scuttle into tough parallel parking spots. The system can move the car diagonally, back and forth, as well as see it rotate a full 360 degrees around its centre axis \u2013 it puts our U-turns to shame.\nNaturally, everything is overseen by Lidar, radar and high-definition cameras, which allows most manoeuvers to be performed autonomously, while exterior projection lighting allows the car to project safety information around it as it performs its party tricks \u2013 seemingly so pedestrians don\u2019t completely freak out.\nThe In-Wheel motor and e-Corner system are \"ready for immediate mass production,\" according to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. The company just needs to find a suitable Hyundai or Kia product to place it in.\n7. Mullen goes supersonic with its 1,000bhp Five RS\nCalifornian EV maker Mullen took the wraps off potentially one of the most aggressive and utterly banzai electric SUVs were have ever laid eyes on. The performance figures hurt just to look at: 1,000bhp, 0-60mph in under two seconds and a top speed in excess of 200mph.\nAll that, and Mullen says it will feature a two-speed transmission, an 800V electrical architecture for faster charging and offer over 300 miles of real-world range. Race-derived Brembo braking products, bucket seats, and an overtly aggressive stance all come as standard.\nBut because this is a modern EV, it also features an enormous dual screen infotainment set-up that is reported to come complete with a built-in voice assistant.\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Five RS is slated to go on sale in Europe in 2025, with a US version following in 2027. Prices are due to start at an eye-watering $295,000 / \u00a3231,000 / \u20ac268,000 / AUS$441,000.\n8. Hyundai takes to the skies\nIn a purpose-built 'vertiport' outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Hyundai\u2019s Supernal S-A2, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) craft that is set to begin testing next year. Designed by Hyundai\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke, the man behind the stunning N Vision 74 (and many others), it takes styling inspiration from the eyes of a bee and features a highly configurable, premium interior that can seat up to four passengers.\nUsing eight tilting rotors, it can fly at speeds of up to 120mph, while the on-board high density battery packs are good for trips ranging from 25 to 40 miles \u2013 although that will increase. The idea is that the craft operates at 1,500ft, way below commercial aircraft, and offers short hops between inner city \u2018vertiports\u2019 using an Uber-style ride hailing platform.\nHead of the project and ex-NASA man Jaiwon Shin, says quietness is key, stating that the S-A2 emits just 65db during take-off and around 45db during cruise, which he says his less than a domestic dishwasher. He wants to avoid people \"looking up\" when it is in operation and hopes it will \"blend into inner-city traffic noise\".\nThe eVTOL craft has 'upgrade-ability' baked into it, meaning the S-A2 is ready to accept the next generation of battery technology. Supernal says it is moving beyond an early technology demonstrator and will begin testing the S-A2 you see before you in 2025.\n9. XPeng reveals pre-order plan for its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nIf XPeng is the Chinese manufacturer of impressive and altogether highly competitive electric cars, XPeng AeroHT is its slightly bonkers, future-thinking little brother. A sibling that comes up with flying car concepts and six-wheeled off-road MPVs that come complete with a human piloted electric 'Air Module' in the back.\n\"I like flying, I have a helicopter, but I can\u2019t take the helicopter where I want. If I have this car, I can drive to where I want, park up and go flying,\" XPeng AeroHT\u2019s co-founder and vice president, Tan Wang told me at CES this year. \"The car is for customers that like to go off-road, but the performance on the road is way better, because it has three motors, one on each axle\" he added.\nIn addition to this, Wang claims the Air Module is much simpler to operate than a standard helicopter, as it blends human piloting skills with advanced levels of autonomy. Because of this, Wang feels it will require much fewer than 40 flying hours to obtain a helicopter license to legally be able to operate the eVTOL craft.\nWang also went on record to say the company was accepting pre-orders as of the end of this year, and that he hoped to have product in the air by the end of 2025. Both the six-wheeled vehicle and the aircraft can be yours for $200,000 /\u00a3157,000 /\u20ac182,000 / AUS$298,000, which feels like a bit of a bargain to us.\nHowever, Wang also pointed out that his company was \"still in the process\" of obtaining certification from the Chinese Aviation Authority, but he was hopeful it would happen soon.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest\u00a0CES news\u00a0from the show as it happens. Stick with us for the big stories on everything from\u00a08K\u00a0TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to\u00a0follow us on TikTok\u00a0for the latest from the CES show floor!\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nLeon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants.

You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
