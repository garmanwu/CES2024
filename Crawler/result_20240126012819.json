In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product\u201d. By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource Optimization\nPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nA newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELL\nThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELL\nThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nThe Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper.

It has since continued for more than 50 years, while undergoing various event frequency changes and taking place in a number of different host cities, including Chicago.\nSony and CES\nSony exhibited at CES for the first time in June 1977, at the Summer CES held in Chicago. The company newsletter at the time stated, \"The CE Show is an event held twice each year, in winter and summer, and is equivalent to Japan's audio fairs and electronics shows, where we give `big demonstrations' of audio products at the venue.\" At the time, CES was more of a consumer electronics trade show, and for Sony it had a strong meaning as a place to unveil new products. For example, at the 1982 Summer CES, the Sony booth set up a \"Future Corner\" featuring a spaceship and exhibited the world's first CD player, which was about to be released at the time, as well as the innovative Mavica Prototype, which could record still images on floppy disks and was a precursor to the electric still camera.\nProposing renaming CES as the \"Creative Entertainment Show\" in 1990\nIn 1990, Akio Morita, then chairman of Sony, was the first Japanese person to provide the keynote speech at CES, an event where executives from leading companies give presentations. In his speech, Morita touched on the products that Sony had developed to date, emphasizing that the consumer electronics industry had entered an era in which new forms of entertainment were being created. He also cited the spread of movie video software and music CDs as an example, saying, \"I leave it up to you whether you believe CES still means \"Consumer Electronics Show\". But by looking back at the past, and peeking over the horizon at the future, I believe the letters CES could be better read as, \"Creative Entertainment Show.\" It is clear that the words \"creative\" and \"entertainment\" have been extremely important to Sony ever since then.\nIn 2019, about 30 years after Morita took the stage, current chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said, \"Sony is a Creative Entertainment Company\". He also stated, \"Working with creators, Sony's professional grade technologies support creators across the entertainment industries to produce compelling content\", which would form the foundation for Sony's current Identity.\nRecently, CES has been increasing its presence as a place where the world's latest technologies can be experienced, not only those from electronics manufacturers but also the automotive, semiconductor and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as various startups. Sony has also gradually changed the approach of its exhibitions, contributing to the possibilities of entertainment and making CES one of the most important venues for introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators. What kind of \"future cutting-edge technology\" do you think will be introduced this year?\nSony's press conference at \"CES 2024\" will be available to watch on Sony Group Official YouTube from January 8, 5:00 p.m. (PST), (archived viewing available). In addition, \"Sony Square\" will gradually release video content related to on-site exhibitions. Please look forward to it!\nIntroducing the Upcoming \"Sony Creators Conference\": Technology Conference for the Creative Community\nSony will hold the first-ever \"Sony Creators Conference \" in Los Angeles on Tuesday, August 8 and Wednesday, August 9 (local time). The event will feature talks and panel discussions by creators from across the Sony Group, including games, technology and film, as well as a keynote speech from Senior Executive Vice President and CTO Hiroaki Kitano. In this blog, we will introduce the main objectives of the event and the lineup of talk sessions that will also be made available online. We invite you to tune into the event for a glimpse into a future at the intersection of creativity and technology.\nWhat are the growth narratives across Sony\u2019s diverse businesses?The \u201cBusiness Segment Meeting 2023\u201d provides a platform for each business unit to share its story\nOn May 24th and 25th, Sony Group Corporation held its \"Business Segment Meeting 2023\u201c, where management from the Game & Network Services, Music, Pictures, Entertainment, Technology & Services, and Imaging & Sensing Solutions segments explained the growth stories of their business.\nContributing to Creativity through Management with a Long-term View, and Achieving Growth through Evolution of Diversity - Sony Corporate Strategy Meeting 2023 -\nSony held the \"Corporate Strategy Meeting 2023\" at its headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo on May 18. Kenichiro Yoshida, Chairman and CEO, spoke on the theme of \"Contributing to Creativity through Management with a Long-term View, and Achieving Growth through Evolution of Diversity.\" In his presentation he provided an overview of Sony's businesses, which originated in sound and have expanded through management from a long-term perspective, and introduced a number of initiatives related to the pursuit of Kando centered on Sony's Purpose. President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki also took the stage and underlined how Sony aims to achieve further growth by continuing to evolve the diversity of its people and businesses, and explained the growth strategies for each business.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Live: News from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Sony, Mullen, Vinfast and more in Las Vegas\nIf you can't be there in person, this is the next best thing\nWe've gotten a lot more automotive (and related) news from CES 2024 than we were expecting. There's been a ton of fun news and cool reveals as the show really gets going into high gear. With major reveals, updates and news from huge automakers and brands like Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Sony, Mercedes-Benz and Vinfast, there's plenty to keep automotive enthusiasts interested this year in Las Vegas.\nWe've already seen a few new vehicles (two-wheeled and four-wheeled), AI tech, infotainment upgrades, autonomous technology and even new tires. If that's not enough, we've covered electric boat motors from Mercury, autonomous tractors from John Deere and a couple flying car/drone/copter things.\nAnd we're not done yet. We'll also be bringing you live impressions from the event covering everything from debuts to random musings from the floor. And you can follow all the action live right here.\nTesla home systems to be integrated with Samsung\u2019s Smart Things\nComing soon: Tesla\u2019s universal wall connector, Powerwall 3 and Solar Inverter can be integrated into Samsung\u2019s Smart Things home ecosystem. The key thing here is the Powerwall. In the event of a power outage, Smart Things will now know how much power is available in the Powerwall, and therefore use its Smart Things AI to dictate how much power each of your Samsung appliances and other devices get/use. It also lets you monitor how much power your Tesla charger is using with the Smart Things app.\nWe try BMW's Remote Valet tech at CES 2024\nByron Hurd and James Riswick got to play 007 when they climbed behind the wheel, pedals and multiple displays of BMW's Remote Valet system and drove a BMW iX around a coned-off course. They take their martinis however you want to make them.\nVerge Motorcycles shows off TS Ultra electric bike at CES 2024\nFinland\u2019s Verge Motorcycles rolls its high-tech TS Ultra into CES 2024. Come for the hubless electric rear motor, stay for the advanced sensor safety package.\nHere's a full gallery of live images directly from the show floor in Las Vegas.\nBollinger's electric truck looks painful at CES 2024\nSenior Editor James Riswick: \"The Bollinger truck cabin has to be the most dangerous and painful interior I have ever seen, including old timey Model T era stuff. Hard metal edges everywhere, no padding anywhere. The armrests are wood for ouch sake.\"\nWe plow a field with John Deere tractor ... 1,300 miles away at CES 2024\nTurning tilling duties over to an autonomously operated tractor could therefore be a big-time time and money saver for farmers. Time for Tractorblog!\nHere at CES 2024, John Deere is showing that possibility is already reality. We got a chance to try out John Deere's autonomous tractor tech by tilling a field 1,300 miles away in Austin, Texas. The technology is currently in beta testing with actual owners/farmers throughout the country.\nMullen Five RS revealed at CES 2024, claims 1,000 horsepower\nMullen came to CES 2024 with some serious electrified firepower in the form of the Mullen Five RS.\nThe Mullen Five RS will feature dual motors with at least 1,000 horsepower and 850 pound-feet of torque and, surprisingly, a two-speed transmission. Those motors will apparently push the 5,070-pound to 50 in under 2 seconds and eventually up to a 200-mph top speed.\nRecaro shows off sim racing seats at CES 2024\nRecaro is showing off a range of advanced seating options for sim racing and endurance racing at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nThe Pro Supreme GT FPR seat, a product of a collaboration between Recaro Automotive and Ford Performance Racing, conceived specifically for the Ford Mustang GT3.\nMoving down the technology spectrum is Recaro FeelTech+, a set of seat insert pads that work with several different Recaro seats. It leverages what Recaro calls Metahaptics, offering immersive haptic and touch experiences for sim racing, e-sports and upscale video games.\nThe seats that can work with FeelTech+ are the Recaro Pro Sim Star, Recaro Profi SPG/SPG XL, the Recaro Pole Position, and the Recaro Sport C with haptics.\nHonda debuts new 'H mark' logo at CES 2024\nIt\u2019s been about 43 years since we\u2019ve seen a redesign of the familiar \u201cH mark\u201d that Honda so lovingly calls it. That changes today at the 2024 CES where Honda debuted a new H mark that is destined for future electric vehicles.\nMercury Marine electrifies boat motors at CES 2024\nYes, this is Autoblog. No, it's not Aquablog. No matter; these new electric boat motors, batteries and controllers from Mercury Marine are more than enough to float our boats (sorry).\nHyundai Mobion Concept does cool (orchestral) maneuvers (in the dark) at CES 2024\nIt also drives diagonally, projects crosswalks for pedestrians, warns others of obstacles.\nA post shared by James Riswick (@jamesriswick)\nThe eVTOL Flying Car from XPeng Aeroht has spinning blades right at head level\nThis is the eVTOL Flying Car from XPeng Aeroht, which as the name and eight carbon fiber whiring blades would suggest, is a flying car concept (among others from this CES and past ones).\nAll those blades fold into the body, allowing you to drive down the street without taking anybody\u2019s head off. And to be clear, that would absolutely happen. They\u2019re basically at neck level for almost every adult.\nVinFast showed the VF Wild electric truck at CES 2024. Here's what we know so far\nThe VinFast VF Wild electric pickup truck is definitely in the midsize range, so similar to a Rivian R1T or possibly a Toyota Tacoma. The bed certainly appears to be longer than Rivian's as-is. But like a Chevy Silverado EV, it can be extended with a midgate.\nThe design is Italian, but unlike the Pininfarina-designed VinFast lineup on sale in America today, this concept was done by Torino Design.\nThe interior looks quite upmarket with lots of brown leather and charcoal gray accent cloth.\nIt's definitely a concept, and as noted on the display, features such as the power midgate are not guaranteed for any production model, and we imagine that the truck has not yet been greenlit.\nThis is a Togg. It is from a Turkish company that makes cars. I guess?\nSenior Editor James Riswick: After examining the various displays and placards to no avail, I asked one of the many people working this stand the very pointed question of \u201cwhat is Togg?\u201d\nI received an answer of a three-pronged solution to eliminating carbon from your life through their Trumore app, energy storage facilities that let you shunt excess solar power from your power company to something you control for later use or donation (how, the presenter didn\u2019t know), and electric cars. Sorry, \u201cSmart mobility device.\u201d They were very pointed about that. The sedan showed here was unveiled today, but apparently Togg\u2019s SUV, the T10X, is for sale. Somewhere.\nI tried, I promise. But for a gigantic stand with a sea of people working at it, that was the best I could come up with. Well, unless I wanted to devote more of my life to Togg. I do not.\nThe Mansory Empower isn't at CES, but it looks like it should be\nCould it be that Mansory is looking to capitalize on flying car news that's sifting out of the Las Vegas hallways during CES 2024?\nMansory stresses that its Empower concept isn't an accurate preview of an upcoming production model. It acknowledges that \"no one can say for sure\" what the car of the future will look like, and that regardless of whether it flies, floats, or travels underground, buyers will always want customization options.\nTo repeat, the Mansory Empower is not at CES. But it sure looks like it should be, right?\nThe VinFast VF 3 is probably smaller than you think it is\nVinFast brought its itty bitty electric SUV, the VF 3, to CES 2024, though it's not technically new.\nA quick reintroduction of the VF 3: it's a little two-door SUV very much in the vein of the equally adorable Suzuki Jimny. In fact, it's actually smaller. At just 125.6 inches long, it's nearly 18 inches shorter than the Suzuki.\nVinFast is aiming for 125 miles on a charge. It didn't say what test cycle that's on. If it's on the WLTP test, that could end up being less for the U.S.\nApparently VinFast talked with U.S. dealers about models, and it was suggested the VF 3 could be offered for less than $20,000.\nWe got the biggest scoop at CES 2024\nJames Riswick, ard at work, getting the scoop here at CES ...\nMercedes-AMG and musician will.i.am developed a technology called MBUX Sound Drive\nMBUX Sound Drive that lets owners use their car as both a musical instrument and a recording studio. Although it sounds science fiction-esque, this system is headed to production later in 2024.\nOnboard sensors feed data to a new software that interprets the car's basic movements as sounds. For example, there's a steering sound, a braking sound, and an acceleration sound. So, MBUX Sound Drive lets the driver compose a song by driving. Instead of playing, say, a progression of G, D, C, and G chords on a guitar, on paper your new song might look something like brake, steer, accelerate, and brake.\nAt least Mullen got the mirror reattached...\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"They managed to replace the driver side door mirror mid-presentation.\"\nThe VinFast VF 3 sure is cool to look at\nThe Vinfast VF 3 has made a fan. Our own Joel Stocksdale: \"Holy crap the VF 3 is so adorable.\"\nHe's not wrong...\nSteering wheel from Magna detects blood-alcohol levels, other signs of driver impairment at CES 2024\nMagna, the global automotive supplier and manufacturer, showed off a new steering wheel at CES that is designed to detect driver impairment, including fatigue and blood-alcohol level. Embedded cameras study eye movements and body language in order to detect drowsiness or impairment.\nThis is not entirely different than existing systems used to determine driver inattention (see Subaru) or making sure drivers are paying attention to the road ahead (see Super Cruise).\nThe big item here, however, is the integration of sensors by Senseair that passively detect alcohol from the ambient air. It can apparently differentiate between breath from the driver and passengers, as well as determine blood-alcohol levels.\nVarious government entities have called for such technologies to prevent drunken driving. As long as the system really can differentiate between breath sources and levels, it certainly seems like a promising idea.\nMercedes-Benz shows off its new MB.OS at CES 2024\nToday at CES 2024, Mercedes says that the first vehicles that will host MB.OS will be its family of MMA platform vehicles, which will include its entry-level models like the CLA, GLA and others.\nOne of the big elements with this new infotainment system will be the AI-driven MBUX Virtual Assistant that runs on MB.OS.\nMercedes says its assistant lives by the principles of \u201cnatural, predictive, personal and empathetic.\u201d You can tailor it however you like via the settings, but it\u2019s designed to learn your routines, offer proactive suggestions and speak to you in a more emotional voice than typical car assistants do. It uses 3D graphics run by the Unity game engine to present itself as a \u201cliving star avatar\u201d to communicate with the driver or passengers in the vehicle.\nMercedes is apparently not a mammal, for it has laid an egg at CES\nSee visual proof here, courtesy of Autoblog's own James Riswick:\nWant to see inside? Sadly there's no yolk, but there is the \u201cMBUX Virtual Assistant\u201d that Mercedes-Benz says is \u201crunning on MB.OS.\u201d\nHyundai Supernal S-A2 VTOL shown off at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai's aircraft-specific subsidiary Supernal showed he latest development of its VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft called S-A2, along with some specifications.\nIt's an electric aircraft, and it features eight full-tilt rotors. The passenger arrangement is set at four plus the pilot. It's designed to cruise at 120 mph at 1,500 feet and handle 25- to 40-mile trips.\nThis cute 'lil bugger is the VinFast VF 3. These pics are live from CES 2024\nNow this thing looks adorable. It's small, which means for America it would probably be seen as an urban commuter. Which also means its estimated range of 125 miles might be sufficient. More to come.\nThis is the VinFast VF Wild electric truck at CES 2024\nWe don't know much about it yet \u2014 it's electric, of course, has a huge door opening and a power midgate \u2014 but as soon as we do, so will you. For now, here are some live pictures from the show floor.\nAnd here's the Honda 0 Series Space-Hub at CES 2024\nHonda's second concept, dubbed the Space-Hub, is described as a \"flexible space that immediately accommodates a variety of passengers and becomes a \u201chub\u201d that connects people to each other and the outside world,\" whatever that means.\nIt looks a lot like a Starfleet shuttlecraft that got tossed back in time and landed at Honda R&D. We could once say the same thing about the Dodge Caravan, but we wont. Oh, oops.\nBehold: The Honda 0 Series Saloon at CES 2024\nThis is the Honda 0 Series Saloon. It will be the first model in the 0 Series lineup, and Honda says it will be the flagship. It's built on a dedicated platform developed using Honda's M//M philosophy: man maximum/machine minimum. Translation: it's low, wide and spacious. And critically, it won't drive itself.\nWe have no idea how to describe what is happening at Mullen right now\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"I have no idea how to describe what is happening at Mullen right now. Benjamin Franklin\u2026. Tesla\u2026 Henry Ford and Ferry Porsche. And then the door mirror fell off.\"\nNo, we're not joking.\nGet a load of these Honda machines at CES 2024!\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Honda is starting over \u201cfrom zero\u201d with a new series of lighter, smaller, more engaging EVs. Check out the doors on the Saloon!\"\nGoogle adds new features to Android Auto and cars with Google built-in\nElectric vehicles compatible with Android Auto can share real-time battery information with Google Maps \u2013 coming first to the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning\nStarting to roll out today, you can send the trip you\u2019ve planned on Google Maps on your Android or iOS phone directly to your car with Google built-in\nToday, Chrome browser is starting to roll out to select Polestar and Volvo cars in beta, and will be available in more cars later this year\nWatch shows from PBS KIDS and Crunchyroll, which are both now available in select cars with Google built-in\nThe Weather Channel app is now available for cars with Google built-in, giving you peace of mind on the road. Now you can stay up-to-date on changing weather conditions with hourly forecasts, follow-me, alerting and \u201cTrip View\u201d radar right from your dashboard\nGoodyear and Gatik expand the use of smart tire technology at CES 2024\nGoodyear and Gatik (a company in the in autonomous middle mile B2B logistics field) announced the expansion the use of Goodyear SightLine technology. It allows Gatik to record and interpret tire intelligence data regarding road conditions and tire health.\nGatik is celebrating Day 1 of #CES2024 with big news! We\u2019re integrating @goodyear intelligent tire technology into our autonomous fleet to advance the safety & efficiency of our middle mile operations.

This is one to watch, folks.\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Waiting for the floor to open on day one of the CES 2024 public show. First stop: Honda.\"\nIndy Autonomous Challenge reveals race car at CES 2024\nA new race car meant for the Indy Autonomous Challenge that was just revealed at CES 2024.\nAs you can see, there ... um, no driver's seat, steering wheel or anything else that would allow a human to race the machine around a course. Hence the \"autonomous challenge\" bit.\nIt's a competition for colleges and universities around the world to develop and race each other in autonomous cars on real racetracks. This next generation of autonomous open-wheel cars will be taken to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Monza and the Goodwood Festival of Speed to compete for big cash prizes.\nLamborghini may not sound like the type of carmaker you associate with CES, but maybe you should.\nOne of the exciting announcements Lambo made at CES 2024 is a new experimental track connectivity system called Telemetry X that leverages three technologies to help the driver set faster lap times: the Real-Time Remote Garage, the Biometric Data System, and the Digital Co-Pilot.\nSony drove the Afeela onstage with a PlayStation 5 controller\nWe already featured the Sony Afeela Concept on this live blog, but what we didn't show you is how the Japanese giant drove the electric car onto the stage at CES 2024. A yoke? Nope. A PlayStation controller!\n\ud83c\udfae Sony drives its new EV onstage with a PlayStation 5 controller #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/2Q6zcxmeRS\nSony Honda Mobility says the Afeela is still on track to be released later this decade, and it's making progress on both hardware and software.\nGoodyear makes tires greener, longer lasting at CES 2024\nGoodyear used CES 2024 to show off its new ElectricDrive 2 tires. Since EVs tend to weigh a lot, they can go through tires faster than owners expect. These new ElectricDrive 2 tires are designed to last a lot longer.\nGoodyear expects the tires to be commercially available in North America starting in May.\nThe Afeela is back! And it's... the same?\nSHM says it's been upgraded with better AI tech, but there's not much new to see here.\nKia's new PBV family is cute and weird\nKia's forthcoming lineup of PBVs is quite fascinating. I'm skeptical that the \"Human Centipede\" tricks will be valuable in the real world, but the emphasis on both loading and boarding from the tailgate makes me wonder why we haven't seen more rear ingress/egress tricks with electric vans and SUVs. You could probably fit four PV1s in a pull-through Texan parking space (imagine them side-by-side and nose-to-nose. Wild, right?\nThe best part about the Kia PBV vans? They're real, and they're coming soon.\nReviews Editor Zac Palmer: \"I would totally ride around in one of these Kia PBV vans if they sold it here. The modular body swapping sounds a bit aspirational on paper, but the idea is neat.\n\"The best part of the PBV reveal is that Kia actually plans on making these cute and useful vans. There\u2019s a whole lot of hot air typically associated with CES, so concrete production plans for as soon as 2025 sure are nice to see.\"\nKia shows off five versions of its Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV for short\nKia's Platform Beyond Vehicle isn\u2019t just one vehicle. In fact, there are five PBVs that were just revealed at CES \u2013 three versions of the Concept PV5, the Concept PV7 and the Concept PV1. All of them are electric.\nAll of the PV vehicles share a similar design language that can most succinctly be described as practical. They\u2019re van-like but without much of a front end to maximize the utility behind the driver and maintain a smaller overall footprint.\nRead the full story here.\nCES 2024 floor highlight: Volkswagen\nBetween other events, I cruised the Volkswagen display, which still had the ID.7 and updated GTI on the stand. Very much looking forward to trying out the GTI's updated tech when it arrives; it's so good to drive but so frustrating to live with.\nIt's a busy day at the Las Vegas Convention Center for CES 2024\nAutoblog Associate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Watching the Hyundai conference from the overflow room due to overcapacity on the main CES show floor.\"\nIt's a busy day at the Las Vegas Convention Center, folks.\nHyundai talks hydrogen and vehicle software at CES 2024\nHyundai let loose on some major plans for the future at CES 2024, mostly surrounding hydrogen and software.\nHyundai will be lumping basically every aspect of its hydrogen work including \"production, storage, transportation, and utilization\" under its HTWO brand (get it?).\n<News Editor Joel Stocksdale, who covered the news for Autoblog, is intrigued by all this cool-sounding hydrogen stuff>\nHyundai referred to its desire to have software-defined everything, or \"SDx.\" What this means is Hyundai will be working on creating its own app market, making development kits available for people and companies to develop apps for Hyundai vehicles. Why should Apple and Google have all the app (and data and monetization) fun to themselves?\n<News Editor Joel Stocksdale, who covered the news for Autoblog, reported that his eyes glazed over at the software stuff>\nClick here for all the details. Sorry in advance if your eyes are like Joel's when you're done reading through it.\nMullen shows of an electric truck and will later debut the Mullen FIVE RS, a \"high-performance EV crossover\"\nWe don't hear much from Mullen Automotive, but the company is on the scene at CES 2024 with several machines to show off. One worth mentioning is the Mullen Three, an electric Class 3 truck that's being shown in two forms.\nThe Bollinger B1 and B2 will also be there, and that reminds us how cool those super boxy off-roaders would have been to see out in the wild. Ah well, at least CES showgoers will get another look at 'em.\nMeet the #MullenTHREE, the electric workhorse redefining urban utility vehicles \ud83d\ude9aThis #Class3 low cab forward #EV truck features a robust payload, superior maneuverability, and versatile chassis.Stop by our booth at @CES to learn how you can elec-THREE-fy your fleet:Jan\u2026 pic.twitter.com/D1gRW0qPt8\nNVIDIA has its hardware and software all over the place at CES 2024\nYou might know NVIDIA mostly for its high-end computer technology, but the chipmaker is deeply involved in the automotive manufacturing world, too. Says the company's latest news release:\n\"Amid explosive interest in generative AI, the auto industry is racing to embrace the power of AI across a range of critical activities, from vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing, to marketing and sales.\"\nWith highlights from Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Pebble (the high-tech trailer company), robotaxi company Zoox and more, NVIDIA clearly has its hands and silicon all over the CES 2024 show floor.\nPanasonic introduces Neuron. Don't worry, it's super easy to understand. Right?\nPanasonic hit the stage at CES 2024 to announce its High-Performance Compute (HPC) system. It's named Neuron (clever, right?), and from what we can decipher, it's a computing platform that includes both hardware and software aimed at extending a vehicle's potential lifecycle by reducing the number of traditional high-cost components and replacing them with new versions that can be upgraded over the life of the vehicle.\nFor the truly techy car enthusiasts out there, here's Panasonic's overview:\n\"With a streamlined design, the Neuron HPC incorporates up-integration capability by consolidating multiple ECUs into one centralized nucleus to handle all levels of ADAS, chassis, body, and in-cabin infotainment features.\"\nThere's more at Panasonic's news site, but for the rest of us, maybe a video would make things easier to understand. So here's that.\n2025 Infiniti QX80's Klipsch audio system previewed at CES 2024\nWe haven't yet seen the actual redesigned 2025 Infiniti QX80 full-size, three-row SUV. No matter. The luxury automaker is offering a preview of the big SUV's high-end audio at CES 2024 all the same.\nKlipsch, well-known as a high-end speaker and audio company, will be supplying the QX80 with a total of 24 speakers and a 24-channel amplifier.\nThe audio system is being showcased in the Infiniti QX Monograph concept, pictured above, which we first saw at Pebble Beach last year.\nBosch shows off Automated Valet Charging and focuses on hydrogen\nBosch, the huge German engineering and technology company, made some interesting announcements at CES 2024 today. The company says,\"Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year. Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption.\"\nA couple highlights:\nAutomated valet charging (a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree)\nElectric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car.\nBosch \"sees hydrogen as a key to meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in a climate-neutral way\"\nThe focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year.\nUsage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service\nThe feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns.\nWhether on the road, at home, or in factories, we're driving forward the electrification of our #technologies for #sustainable energy use. \ud83c\udf43 Two examples are our heat pump for colder climates & our automated valet charging solution: https://t.co/imiMxFyAY5 #BoschCES #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/yzukGjVpX5\nLG announces production of EV chargers in the United States\nMore EV chargers in the United States is definitely a welcome development.

The aim of the strategic partnership is to work together even more closely together, particularly in the area of research and development.\nThomas Nickels, Senior Vice President Engineering at MAN, sees the cooperation as a specialty in the market: \"Cooperation in the area of research and development is rather rare in our industry. Together with ABB E-mobility, we are striving for a trusting, binding and transparent partnership. We are already starting with the development of products and standards and are focusing on the special requirements of the commercial vehicle industry.\"\nThe importance of cross-industry cooperation for the entire sector is particularly evident for megawatt charging system (MCS), Nickels continued: \"At MCS, we are working with players from the entire sector to enable charging capacities in the megawatt range in the future and thus sustainable and economical long-distance heavy goods and passenger transport. By cooperating with ABB E-mobility, we can tackle the challenges of the new technology at an early stage and drive standardization forward more quickly.\" These challenges include the ISO15118-20 communication standard and new ways of transmitting signals. The basis for MCS is Ethernet communication, which is being used for the first time in electromobility. Early software and interoperability tests with vehicles and charging stations should help to establish reliable products as quickly as possible in an emerging market environment. This is why the cooperation, which is initially scheduled to run for three years, is focusing on the customer experience right from the start, in addition to the internal development and further development of charging stations, vehicles and software.\n\"High charging performance, reliable technology and customer confidence \u2013 these are the prerequisites for the success of electromobility in heavy goods and long-distance passenger transport. By working together with MAN right from the early product phase, we can respond even better to the needs of our customers. By 2025, we want to bring a product to the market that meets the requirements of logistics,\" says Floris van de Klashorst, Senior Vice President Products & Hardware Platforms at ABB E-mobility.\n\"The market needs an ecosystem that interlocks and works reliably. That's why we want to jointly develop a concept for the interaction of MCS and CCS that addresses issues such as space, energy supply and grid expansion. MAN's extensive expertise helps us to develop customer-oriented solutions \u2013 both for use in the depot and on the track,\" says van de Klashorst, giving an outlook on future projects.\nThe cooperation is not just limited to logistics: \"MCS will also be used in future in the travel sector, for example for motorhomes and coaches. This will bring additional challenges and a change in user behavior,\" continues the Head of Development.\nMAN Truck & Bus is one of Europe's leading commercial vehicle manufacturers and providers of transport solutions with an annual turnover of around 11 billion euros (2022). The product portfolio includes vans, trucks, buses, diesel and gas engines as well as services for passenger and freight transport. The electric drive is already an integral part of the standard range of MAN buses and MAN vans, and a comprehensive portfolio of series-produced electric trucks has been on sale since October 2023. Together with digitalisation and automation in road freight transport, the transition to CO2-free driving is a key pillar of the NewMAN strategy for the future, with which the company is transforming itself from a commercial vehicle manufacturer into a provider of intelligent and sustainable transport solutions by 2030.

(Further reading: Designing Inclusively: a Primer.)\nIn addition, Nimble will exhibit what is touted as the \"first smart at-home nail salon.\"\nMeanwhile, Amorepacific's Lipcure Beam technology has been honored with the CES 2024 Innovation Award. The\u00a0device reportedly combines lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one unit.\nIts cap houses a\u00a0 sensor capable of diagnosing the condition of the lips, including moisture levels. The cap can be removed to reveal a brush-like makeup applicator that deposits a light-responsive material to the lips and a customized visible light that can, in combination with the material, boost\u00a0the response of riboflavin.\nThis reaction between the light and the deposited material reportedly strengthens the collagen fibers inside the lips, forming a moisturizing barrier on the surface. The result is slowed lip aging, per Amorepacific.\nThe design supports one-handed application and \"employs a universal color system naturally suited for all races and ages.\"\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific's R&I center, said, \"We are profoundly honored that Amorepacific's renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award. The R&I center at Amorepacific will continue to exert extensive efforts, ensuring every customer achieves a satisfying life through their unique beauty and health.\""
