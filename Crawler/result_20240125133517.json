Their support enabled Lightning's repair and Bmmpr technology's faultless integration into the 1967 Mustang Fastback, which will debut at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\nEvery year, CES is the biggest tech expo, where firms unveil their latest products and most ambitious projects.\nCommencing on January 9th and culminating on January 12th, the event heralds an influx of groundbreaking announcements. Leading up to the show, companies have steadily released teasers and announcements, setting the stage for groundbreaking revelations as the conference unfolds.\nAccording to reports, CES will see notable absences due to the United Auto Workers strike causing Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis to cancel their plans. Despite this, expect auto-related reveals: Honda introduces a \"global EV series,\" in-car tech, and AI/machine learning.\nMercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and BMW will reveal, while Intel and Amazon tease future vehicle items, strengthening their supplier roles. Although fewer automotive updates are expected, CES will still cater to gearheads and mobility enthusiasts, offering surprises amidst the absence of major players.\nRELATED ARTICLE: CES 2024: Hyundai Unveils Using Hydrogen Energy and Software to Achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2050\nCopyright @ MOTORTIMES, All rights reserved.

CES 2024 will take place Jan. 9-12 in Las Vegas. A fully restored 1967 Mustang Fastback named Lightning is the centerpiece of the booth, displaying what Bmmpr's technology can do with an open automotive network extending to physical interaction.\n\"We want to show how to elevate ownership of the vehicle that the customer already owns, increasing brand loyalty as well as longevity,\" Bmmpr CEO and Co-Founder Marko Mandaric said. \"Original Equipment Manufacturers who partner with us stand to reap immeasurable benefits by allowing us to communicate with their vehicles in a secure and efficient manner, via protocols that have long been established.\"\nThis is the company's largest booth at CES yet at 40' x 40', and, along with Lightning, there will be several sections for attendees to engage in. There will be an interactive video game with a tennis ball-shooting bazooka, a dazzling LED wall with cinematic content, and complimentary freshly-ground espresso. The company will also be displaying the capabilities of its next generation product Bmmpr \u00d7 Cars.\u00a0Bmmpr \u00d7 Cars is an easily installable electronic device that turns any car into a smartCar. It works by plugging into a vehicle's OBD-II port underneath the dash. Loaded with nine sensors, the compact hardware and accompanying Bmmpr: Next mobile app, provides protection and peace of mind bundled into a simple and affordable all-in-one monthly subscription, with no added hardware costs.\nMore than 1 million vehicles were stolen in 2022, which amounts to about two cars stolen every minute, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Bmmpr is leading the way in combating this unfortunate reality.\n\"In the last three years we've all come to realize how bad car security actually is,\" Mandaric said. \"Catalytic converter theft is a problem. Vehicles can be stolen with a USB stick. Clearly there has been a misstep in the process of automobile evolution. We've been working hard in the shadows at developing a solution to car security that we realized doesn't exist.\"\nVisit Bmmpr at booth #7029 in LVCC's West Hall during CES 2024 to learn more. Marko Mandaric will also be giving a live keynote at 11 a.m. Jan. 10 entitled, \"The SmartCar of the Future is Already Sitting in Your Driveway\" in Bmmpr's West Hall booth.\nAbout BmmprStarted in 2015, San Francisco-based Bmmpr creates best-in-class technology to keep assets smart and secure.
