        "raw_content": "Equinix opens doors on new Ashburn, Va. data center\nEquinix has enlarged its footprint in the Washington D.C. area with the opening of its 16th International Business Exchange (IBX) data center, DC21.\nEquinix broke ground on DC21 a little over a year ago. With the addition of the DC15 data center, which opened earlier this year, Equinix has invested more $200 million in the Washington D.C. area this year.\nEquinex's new Washington D.C. area data centers are part of its data center campus in Ashburn, Va. \u00a0As a strategic communications hub for the eastern U.S. as well as a major gateway to Europe, Ashburn is one of the largest peering points in North America and one of the largest in the world. In addition to colocation and data centers, Ashburn, which is located in Loudoun County, is also a key hub for hyperscale cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services.\nLoudoun County\u2019s \u201cdata center alley\u201d is the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, with more than 18 million square feet currently in operation and millions more being planned or developed.\nEquinix's 16 IBX data centers house more than 200 network service providers, which is more than any other data center provider in the\u00a0Washington D.C.\u00a0metro area.\nThe Citadel, which is owned by Switch, is currently the largest data center campus in the world. It's located in Nevada, and its campus covers an area of 7.2 million square feet. It also has the largest data center building, Tahoe Reno 1, with 1.3 million square feet of space, surpassing the previously held record by Lakeside Technology at 1.1 million square feet.\nThe $95 million first phase of DC21 will provide more than 41,000 square feet of colocation space, offering an initial capacity of 925 cabinets. Upon completion of the planned future phases, DC21 is expected to provide total capacity of 3,100 cabinet equivalents and colocation space of more than 124,000\u00a0square feet.\nDC21, which has the headroom to expand to six data halls, is located on 34-acres, which gives Equinix the room to build up to three more IBXs. In an email to FierceTelecom, Equinix said the dates for the remaining phases of expansion in DC21 would be determined based on overall capacity needs.\nThe $111 million\u00a0first phase of DC15 opened in the second quarter of this year with an initial capacity of 1,600 cabinet equivalents and colocation space of approximately 23,000 square feet.\nThe expansion of the Equinix's Ashburn Campus also included a Co-Innovation Facility (CIF), which allows technology vendors to test, demonstrate and evolve their products by working with Equinix. \u00a0The Equinix Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) elements are already in use at DC15 and in other IBXs as well.\nA few\u00a0examples of technology innovations being developed at the Equinix CIF include using fuel cell technology, using next generation cooling, deploying software-defined power and testing new sensors that increase sustainability.\nRELATED: Equinix takes the wraps off of new bare metal service\nThe Washington D.C. area is also one of four markets that offer Equinix Metal. Based off of its deal to buy Packet earlier this year, Equinix announced the availability of its Equinix Metal platform early last month.\nEquinix blended Packet's bare metal technology with its Equinix Fabric, which was previously known as Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric, to spin up bare-metal servers in under 15 minutes. Equinix Fabric provides access to a software-defined interconnection service spanning 237 data centers deployed near major internet exchanges across 46 geographies.\nEquinix Metal provides digital businesses with an automated \"as-a-service\" model, which gives companies the option to deploy the physical infrastructures of their choice at \"software speed\" across Equinex's platform. With Equinix Metal, businesses can click-and-configure their services via an API and common libraries, or leverage the tools that they are already using to manage infrastructure-as-code."

        "raw_content": "NTT Global Data Centers Plans Massive New Campus in Northern Virginia\nNTT Global Data Centers is expanding its presence in Northern Virginia with a massive new campus in Prince William County, the company said today. NTT has acquired property from Lerner Enterprises in Gainesville, Va. where it plans to develop 2 million square feet of data center space, supporting 336 megawatts (MWs) of capacity.\nThe 103-acre campus will provide room for long-term growth for NTT and its customers in Northern Virginia, where the company already operates a major campus in \u201cData Center Alley\u201d in Ashburn, the primary cloud hub in Loudoun County.\nNTT says the Gainesville project will become its single largest campus, with plans for four two-story data center buildings, with the first scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2024.\u00a0 The design will also offer \u201cdedicated self-contained areas for large-footprint deployments\u201d to support hyperscale clients.\n\u201cThe development of a new data center campus in Virginia is testament to our huge growth and momentum across North America\u201d said Doug Adams, President and CEO at NTT Global Data Centers Americas. \u201cThis strategic purchase of land is just one of the many steps we\u2019re taking to accelerate our data center footprint across the country.\u201d\nNTT Global Data Centers Americas is in the midst of a major expansion, with construction projects underway across the U.S. to add more capacity. The company has spent the past two years entering new markets, opening data center campuses in Hillsboro, Chicago, Santa Clara and Phoenix.\n\u201cThe development of our new campus in Virginia will be one of 14 ongoing projects taking place across the globe,\u201d said Masaaki Moribayashi, President and Board Director, NTT Ltd. \u201cBy 2025, it is estimated that 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms, up from 30% in 2021. As a result, the demand for data centers to support this shift has never been higher. As one of the largest data center providers in the world, NTT is well placed to support this reliance, and we\u2019re focused on supporting our customers as their needs continue to change,\u201d\nData Center Developers Look Beyond Ashburn\nNorthern Virginia has become the global capital for cloud computing, and is home to hundreds of data centers. That includes many hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, as well as data center developers who support their growth.\nData center development in Prince William County has accelerated in recent years as development parcels grow scarce near the regional data center hub in Ashburn in Loudoun County. There is now a growing cloud cluster near Manassas, and land speculation from developers has boosted property values, with recent transactions valuing data center development sites at nearly $1 million an acre.\nThere is now an estimated 5.3 million square feet of data center space in Prince William County, with another 8 million to 10 million square feet in the development pipeline, according to a recent report.\nThe NTT project is part of a data center building boom in Gainesville around the intersection of Route 66 and 29 (Lee Highway). The NTT property is across the highway from Gainesville Crossing, a large campus from Corscale that will feature 2.3 million square feet of data center space and 306MW of utility power.\nBoth projects are west of the proposed Prince William Digital Gateway, which could add millions of addition square feet of data centers and has generated lively debate about the appropriate location for future development in the county.\nNTT Accelerates Global Data Center Expansion\nThe Gainesville campus is part of an ongoing global expansion for NTT, which plans to increase its data center footprint to more than 1,000 MWs in 20 countries by the end of 2022. NTT says its data centers in Prince William will be sustainable, as part of the company\u2019s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions across its data center operations by 2030.\nIn addition to its U.S. campuses, NTT Global Data Centers recently announced the opening of data centers in Madrid, Navi Mumbai in India, and its largest data center in Indonesia in Jakarta. NTT Global Data Centers also has ongoing construction that will deliver new data centers in Germany, India, and Johannesburg later this year.\nIn the U.S., each campus is designed for multiple data centers, which allows customers who want contiguous space to easily add capacity in adjacent data halls or buildings. Here\u2019s a look at the company\u2019s US footprint:\nIn 2018 NTT Global (then known as RagingWire) launched its primary campus in Data Center Alley in Ashburn, shifting to greenfield construction, customized from the ground up to support the company\u2019s vision for Internet-scale campuses.\nThe first building, VA3, is a 16 MW data center featuring a mix of vault designs from 2 megawatts to 6 megawatts of power capacity, as well as a large room for multi-tenant retail colocation. VA4 and VA5 are 32-megawatt buildings with expanded and standardized vaults, and VA6 will feature NTT\u2019s new 36-megawatt design \u2013 two floors, with three 6-megawatt data halls on each floor.\nAt least three more data center buildings are planned for the Ashburn campus, totaling 224 megawatts of capacity. The Prince William campus will be 50 percent larger, providing a next phase of growth for NTT and its clients from 2024 forward.\nHaving capacity can provide an advantage, especially as customers seek accelerated delivery timelines to meet demand for cloud services.\n\u201cOne of the things our client base has told us that they appreciate how we build ahead in our markets,\u201d said Adams in a recent conversation with DCF.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nAmazon Plans Major Data Center Expansion in Virginia's Spotsylvania County\nDCF Tours: NTT Global Data Centers Americas' Dallas TX1, Garland, Texas\nSponsored Recommendations\nData-driven Asset Performance Management White Paper\nA Guide to Understanding the NFPA 70B Code Changes\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled\nVoices of the Industry\nJumpstarting your Data Center Decarbonization Journey\nLatest in Cloud\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nScorecard: Looking Back at Data Center Frontier\u2019s 2023 Industry Predictions\nThe Top Data Center Industry Stories of 2023\nWhite Papers\nThe Data Center Edge of Tomorrow: Five Critical Ways Digital Twins and AI Will Impact the Network\nSponsored\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nIoT EcoStruxure Ensures Continued Learning at Bainbridge Island School District\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled"
