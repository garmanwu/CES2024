        "raw_content": "GAMBIT MAGAZINE\nEntertainment Unfiltered\nAudio Radar Helps Hearing-Impaired Players See Sound Effects \u2013 CES 2024\nSee & Hear!\nChances are pretty good you play games with a number of wonderful sounds (in addition to the soundtrack, that is). Sounds that tell you something wonderful, like a crit, has happened. Sounds that tell you you\u2019ve been hit with a negative status effect. Sounds that tell you something\u2019s about to jump out from behind that wall and try to kick your ass. For those with hearing impairments, however, those little audio cues aren\u2019t exactly accessible. And that\u2019s where Audio Radar comes in.\nLaunched at CES 2024, Audio Radar allows the hearing impaired to \u201csee the sound\u201d (according to AirDrop Gaming LLC, the company behind it). And the setup couldn\u2019t be more simple; the device plugs into a console or PC and converts audio data into lights. Said lights are set up around the screen, and light up in the direction of the given sound with colors representing the type of sound. Red is representative of enemy sounds, while green is neutral or ambient sounds.\nAlongside the device, AirDrop Gaming also launched an SDK. This will allow developers to incorporate Audio Radar into their games moving forward. And while it\u2019s true that many older games likely won\u2019t support the device, it does have its own software to interpret stereo or surround sound audio on the fly for non-compliant games.\nWhile it\u2019s still early going, several major companies have shown interest in the technology. According to AirDrop CEO Tim Murphy, Logitech is currently \u201cproviding support as we further develop our product and design our go-to-market strategy.\u201d In addition, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was seen at the booth on the opening day of the show. So it\u2019s definitely going places.\nWhile Audio Radar has just launched, it\u2019ll still be some time until it ships to a wider market later this year. In the meantime, AirDrop will continue to develop products for the deaf and hearing-impaired gamers of the world. As of right now, though, Audio Radar works on PC, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles.\nSource: Engadget\nAbout Author\nBased out of Glendale California, Bryan is a GAMbIT\u2019s resident gaming contributor.

        "raw_content": "Audio Radar helps gamers with hearing loss 'see' sound effects instead\nAt CES 2024, the company announced a new SDK and partnership with Logitech.\nAudio cues can sometimes be crucial for success in games. Developers frequently design the sound environment for their experiences to be not only rich and immersive, but to also contain hints about approaching enemies or danger. Players who are hard of hearing can miss out on this, and it's not fair for them to be disadvantaged due to a disability. A product called Audio Radar launched at CES 2024 and it can help turn sound signals into visual cues, so that gamers with hearing loss can \"see the sound,\" according to the company AirDrop Gaming LLC.\nThe setup is fairly simple. A box plugs into a gaming console to interpret audio output and converts that data into lights. A series of RGB light bars surround the screen, and display different colors depending on the type of sound coming from the respective direction they represent. Put simply, it means that if you're walking around a Minecraft world, like I did at the company's booth on the show floor, you'll see lights of different colors appear on the different bars.\nRed lights mean sounds from enemies are in the area adjacent to the corresponding light, while green is for neutral sounds. An onscreen legend also explains what the sounds mean, though that might just be for the modded Minecraft scenario on display at CES.\nI walked around the scene briefly, and could see green lights hovering above a pen of farm animals, while purple lights fluttered in tandem with a dragon flying overhead. I did find it a little confusing, but that is probably due more to the fact that I know very little about Minecraft, and as someone with hearing I might not appreciate the added information as much as someone without.\nWith an SDK that the company launched at the show, developers will be able to customize the lights and visual feedback to elements in their game so that they have control over what their hard-of-hearing gamers see. In the meantime, Audio Radar is using its own software to detect stereo or surround sound signals to convert to feedback in lights and colors.\nThough the product may seem in its early stages, various major gaming companies have appeared to indicate interest in Audio Radar. AirDrop Gaming's CEO Tim Murphy told me that Logitech is \"providing support as we further develop our product and design our go-to-market strategy.\" Also, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was spotted at the booth on opening day.\nAudio Radar is beginning to ship on a wider level this year, and the company continues to develop products for gamers who are deaf and hard of hearing, among other things. The system works with Xbox, PlayStation and PC.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

And there's more to come from its creator at Airdrop Gaming.\nHipShotDot is one of the most ingenious video game peripherals ever made. Why? Because it's such an easy, practical product. It's simply an LED light that you can attach to your television. That's it. But Airdrop Gaming offers many convincing reasons why hardcore shooter players would even want such a thing. By using the suction cup to attach the light to your TV, players will have a permanent red dot sight, one that lets players aim more quickly, shoot from the hip with precision, and avoid the effects of EMPs in games. In a game like Call of Duty, you'll be able to forgo wasting a customization slot on a weapon sight--because it's already attached to your television.\nWith an MSRP of $30, the markup on the HipShotDot is quite significant. However, hardcore shooter players will probably want every advantage they can get. This video from Airdrop Gaming is incredibly compelling:\nIt's hard to imagine how Airdrop Gaming could possibly improve upon such a simple design, but at CES, co-founder Tim Murphy told Shacknews that there were already plans for a second-generation version of the HipShotDot. The main improvement I could imagine is a thinner or transparent cable that connects to the dot. Right now, it dangles below the red dot, creating a very visible and somewhat-distracting line that goes down the middle of the TV.\nBut Murphy isn't content on being a one-trick pony. Murphy told me that the company is working on entirely new products as well, all geared towards helping shooter players. It's hard to imagine what else can be done--but Murphy's a man that convinced me that putting a red dot in the middle of your TV is worth paying money for. It'll be fascinating to see what Airdrop has in store.\nAndrew Yoon was previously a games journalist creating content at Shacknews.\nAndrew Yoon posted a new article, AirDrop Gaming planning second-generation HipShotDot and more accessories.HipShotDot is one of the most ingenious video game peripherals ever made. And there's more to come from its creator at Airdrop Gaming.\nThis seems like cheating to me.\ni've thought about doing it myself with a sticker, but i felt like i would be cheating. its one thing to have better hardware that lets you run the game better, but this is in fact changing the gameplay mechanics.\nSeems to be cheating to them also. Look at the quote at the end of the video.\n\"Always cheat, always win. The only unfair fight is the one you lose.\" -United States Marines\nLooks about like taping two pieces of black thread across your monitor, permanent cross hairs for those \"you don't have a cross hair until you zoom in\" games.\nNot something I'd want to do - sticking something that could leave residue to my screen.\nlol\nI used to put a little piece of blue tack on my screen in hardcore BF3 matches :$\nMy KDR is still better than yours!\nScrew you hippy!\nIf a game offers 100% accurate hip shots that's worse than putting a light on your monitor.\nseems cheap......then again....i suppose people have been using those type of things for quite a while.\n\"Always cheat, always win. The only unfair fight is the one you lose\"...\nThis is the lamest looking crap I have ever seen.\nVictory's not worth resorting to sticking a tacky LED light with a wire down the middle of my LED HDTVs screen.\nI know that pros see this as invaluable, but I can't watch that video and think anything else but...this is just stupid, AND cheating.\nWould they seriously let you use this stuff in a tournament?\nI don't quite understand this - Does it hack the software or does it just show you the exact center of the screen? For example if I was playing CS GO would this reduce recoil in the game and show me center or would I still recoil after more than two shots like normal? What exactly is the point?\nPlus is this a paid advertisement?\nThis product is a knockoff of another that was for sale to the public over a year before he introduced our concept to the Start Garden startup funding website.\nHeadshot Red Dot is the original laser dot aim-assist accessory; it's superior, more affordable, and comes with a satisfaction guarantee.\nhttp://www.HeadshotRedDot.com"
