As a responsible company, HAVIT will introduce a new eco-friendly packaging program to help meet the global carbon neutrality target in real terms.\nHAVIT will formally implement an eco-friendly and low-carbon packaging strategy starting in 2024. HAVIT aims to optimize its packaging structure and volume by following the UN Environment Programme's Redesign-Reduce-Recycle principles. The company will employ 100% recyclable FSC-certified product packaging materials and replace its inner trays and hooks with paper cards, thereby reducing its plastic usage by at least 80%. It will enable HAVIT to join the over 1,600 companies worldwide that are licensed to promote FSC-certified products. The inner tray and hook of its package will be replaced by paper card, reducing the use of plastic by at least 80%; it will also adopt pure vegetable-based ink for printing, replacing UV-coating with satin aqueous coating and embossing and debossing processes to reduce the pollution of soil and water; the PLA plastic will be used can be degraded within only one year.\nHAVIT strongly supports sustainable growth by actively taking practical steps and is acutely aware of the significance of environmental conservation.
