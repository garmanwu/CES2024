        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nThe annual Consumer Technology Show rolled into the Las Vegas Convention Center last week. These are what we think are the most interesting pieces of tech coming from the event.\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting.

With these enhancements, U.S. insurers can now configure the Flyreel AI solution with their own underwriting preferences. The AI solution is then able to help expedite the underwriting process by capturing and evaluating completed property surveys and inspections, using proprietary computer vision technology to highlight key risks in alignment with each carrier's unique risk appetite.\nWith this no-code enhancement, insurers can prioritize risks based on their needs and preferences while reducing the amount of time it takes to act on the risks they deem most important \u2013 risks including but not limited to exterior and interior condition issues, roof damage, recalled electrical systems and water damage. Insurers can then set parameters based on the Flyreel solution's self-service inspection capabilities that align with their underwriting preferences, structuring their workflows accordingly. LexisNexis Flyreel also helps offer its customers even more consumable information by delivering an actionable report based on those identified needs \u2013 whether customers use a dashboard or system-to-system integration.\n\"Over the last several months, we have been hard at work enhancing the Flyreel solution to deliver more meaningful, configurable insights for insurers as we look to offer the most current and comprehensive understanding of property in the market,\" said George Hosfield, senior director, home insurance, LexisNexis Risk Solutions. \"The home insurance market has been using data for a long time, but the question we continue to ask ourselves is how carriers can use the data and advanced analytics in the most optimal manner \u2013 or focus on what is most critical to their businesses so that they can be better equipped to meet new and emerging underwriting challenges. And that's what we're really solving for with this enhancement to Flyreel.\"\nAccording to a report by S&P Globali, loss ratios for Q3 2022 were at 98%, exceeding that of the previous four years, fueled largely by increasing home claim severity, which is up by 37% year-over-yearii.\n\"We recognize that every day our customers are faced with new market challenges such as rising inflation, labor availability and growing expectations from consumers and employees around digital experiences,\" said Cole Winans, vice president, home insurance, and original founder of Flyreel. \"The ability to use technology as a force multiplier to help capture and act on ground truth data at scale, in alignment with each insurer's business needs, speaks directly to these challenges. We're fully committed to equipping each of our home insurance customers with more advanced solutions, so that they can better serve the market, and we remain hard at work on additional capabilities.\"\nAbout LexisNexis Risk SolutionsLexisNexis\u00ae Risk Solutions harnesses the power of data and advanced analytics to provide insights that help businesses and governmental entities reduce risk and improve decisions to benefit people around the globe.

The HPCC Systems platform includes a data refinery (Thor) and a rapid data delivery engine (ROXIE) that utilize the Enterprise Control Language (ECL).[5] LexisNexis Risk Solutions open-sourced the HPCC Systems platform in 2011, and has seen some success with the adoption of this platform by diverse entities, an example being GuardHat, which makes smart hard hats with embedded HPCC Systems technology.\nHistory[edit]\nA subsidiary of RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier), LexisNexis Risk Solutions first began as the Risk & Information Analytics Group (RIAG) within LexisNexis, a corporation offering legal database services. In 2000, Reed Elsevier acquired RiskWise and PeopleWise, which together became the basis of RIAG.[6] The creation of RIAG expanded LexisNexis offerings to include public records collections. In 2000, LexisNexis also launched HPCC Systems, its data-intensive computing system platform.\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions moved into Collections after Reed Elsevier acquired the public records businesses of Dolan Media Company in 2003.[7] That same year, the LexisNexis Special Services Inc. (LNSSI) was founded to provide government agencies with global sources of data fusion technology and analytics. LNSSI also granted Reed Elsevier the ability to participate in classified U.S. government programs as a foreign-owned entity.\nIn 2004, Reed Elsevier purchased Seisint Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida.[8] Seisint housed and operated the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).\nIn September 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased data aggregator ChoicePoint. This acquisition included an insurance business and the C.L.U.E. database, an underwriting database for the U.S. auto insurance market. LexisNexis completed the migration of public records to HPCC Systems the same year.\nLaunch[edit]\nIn September 2009, ChoicePoint was integrated with the Risk & Information Analytics Group (RIAG), and the combined new entity became LexisNexis Risk Solutions. In 2011, LexisNexis Risk Solutions was officially launched as a separate company within the Reed Elsevier portfolio.\nMark Kelsey was named CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions in December 2012.[9] Over the next two years the company purchased 12 companies, including WorldCompliance, Enclarity, Mapflow, Tracesmart, Wunelli and Health Market Science.\nDivestiture[edit]\nIn January 2013, LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced it would sell its background screening business to the Palo Alto-based private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG).\nSTG planned to combine LexisNexis screening with its portfolio company, First Advantage.[10]\nCoplogic (2014)[edit]\nIn December 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired Coplogic, a leading provider of citizen self-reporting software solutions to law enforcement agencies. The acquisition \u2013 which includes Coplogic\u2019s technology, staff and book of business \u2013 adds a citizen incident reporting capability to the LexisNexis eCrash solution.[11]\nInsurance Initiatives Ltd. (2016)[edit]\nIn July 2016, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired Insurance Initiatives Ltd. (IIL), a data distribution platform that extracts, hosts and processes large quantities of data to deliver information into the point-of-quote in the U.K.'s Property and Casualty Insurance industry.[12]\nAppriss (2016)[edit]\nIn August 2016, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired the Crash and Project business group Appriss, a public safety business that provides technology solutions for the efficient collection of crash reports and electronic citations. LexisNexis will utilize the acquired technology within its LexisNexis Coplogic Solutions portfolio, a comprehensive electronic crash and incident reporting suite, to enhance its capabilities to provide a more complete solution to the law enforcement community.[13]\nThreatMetrix (2018)[edit]\nRELX purchased ThreatMetrix, a digital identity and risk-based authenticator platform, in February 2018.[14]\nLumen (2019)[edit]\nIn May 2019, LexisNexis Risk Solutions purchased Lumen, an integrated data platform leveraged by public safety and law enforcement from Numerica Corporation.[15]\nID Analytics (2020)[edit]\nIn January 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions closed its acquisition of ID Analytics, a provider of fraud and credit risk solutions. Previously ID Analytics was a NortonLifeLock company.[16]\nEmailage (2020)[edit]\nIn March 2020, LexisNexis\nRisk Solutions, acquired Emailage, an Arizona-based fraud prevention and risk management solutions provider.[17]\nGovernance[edit]\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions is a subsidiary of RELX (tickers: RELX and REL.UK).\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions and Reed Business Information compose RELX's Risk & Business Analytics market segment, led by CEO Mark Kelsey and overseen by the RELX board of directors.\nCorporate social responsibility[edit]\nMissing children[edit]\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the ADAM (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) program in 2000 to help the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) find missing children.[18] ADAM distributes missing child alert posters to law enforcement, hospitals, libraries and businesses within specific geographic search areas. The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.[19]\nIn 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system's radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.\u2019s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.\nFood stamp fraud prevention[edit]\nSince 2013, the Florida Department of Children and Families used LexisNexis Risk Solutions for its identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.[citation needed]\nHumanitarian emergency education[edit]\nIn 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education's Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.\nLaw enforcement[edit]\nThe Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.\nThe LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement \u201cgreater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.\u201d It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people's identities so that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.\nCOVID-19[edit]\nCOVID-19 analyzer[edit]\nIn April, 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions created a free tracking tool to monitor and report the progress of the Covid-19 virus and provide better contextual understanding of the pandemic's evolution. Using data from Johns Hopkins University (daily cases and deaths), the US Census Bureau (US population) and the UN DESA (world population), the tracker provides metrics and analysis for locations across the globe, with maps that drill down to country and regional levels, helping to understand how the virus is propagating.[20]\nIn July 2020, Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's College of Engineering and Computer Science in collaboration with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, received a grant for Rapid Research (RAPID) from the National Science Foundation to develop a model of COVID-19 spread using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. The project leverages prior experience in modeling Ebola spread to successfully model the spread of COVID-19.[21]\nCOVID-19 Data Resource Center[edit]\nThe Health Care segment of LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced in April 2020 the launch of a free COVID-19 Data Resource Center to provide county-level insights on at-risk populations and potential care capacity gaps to support the U.S. healthcare industry's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining its own data and analytics with those of other industry stakeholders, the company created insights to be used by healthcare organizations, public health officials and health researchers to help allocate resources to the populations with the greatest need.[22] The COVID-19 Data Resource Center features heat maps with insights that identify at-risk populations and correlated gaps in provider coverage. Each county is assigned a percentile rank on a scale of 0 (low-risk) to 100 (high-risk) across various parameters. The map is updated regularly to quickly address the care needs of the community.\nIn June 2020, the group added national telehealth trending insights to its COVID-19 Data Resource Center to show exponential growth of telehealth adoption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.[23]\nSee also[edit]\nReferences[edit]"

        "raw_content": "The U.S. Supreme Court today granted a request by the U.S. Solicitor General to participate in oral argument as an amicus in Warner Chappell Music v. Nealy, which challenges a circuit court ruling that, under the discovery accrual rule, monetary damages for infringement under the Copyright Act are available for acts occurring outside of the Copyright Act\u2019s three-year statute of limitations. The Solicitor General is urging the Supreme Court to affirm the lower ruling and uphold the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the High Court\u2019s ruling in Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (2013) over competing interpretations in the Second Circuit.\n5 hours ago\n0\nThe U.S. Supreme Court today denied certiorari to Diamond J Wholesale, LLC, who petitioned the Court in December 2023 to clarify how individual liability for willful trademark infringement by a corporation should be assessed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\u00a0in August 2023 backed\u00a0a Georgia district court\u2019s finding that Diamond and its owner, Raj Solomon, willfully infringed trademarks owned by Top Tobacco, L.P., Republic Technologies (NA), LLC, and Republic Tobacco, L.P. (Top Tobacco) for cigarette rolling papers. The ruling upheld an $11 million verdict in favor of the tobacco companies.\n9 hours ago\n0\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is global, and copyright laws are national. Thus, some countries will have strict laws on making copies of copyrighted content to \u201ctrain\u201d an AI system while others will be more relaxed. Laws are about economics, and countries with more relaxed laws are likely to be countries with smaller creative industries and which wish to use the relaxed legal regime to attract AI investment. AI companies will use these jurisdictional differences as leverage to lobby for the relaxation of legal standards in countries with stricter laws.\n15 hours ago\n1\nAs reported on IPWatchdog, the UK Supreme court recently ruled that a trained neural network (an Artificial Intelligence known as DABUS) could not be listed as the inventor on two patent applications filed by Dr. Stephen Thaler at the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO). As a result, the two applications were treated as withdrawn for failing to comply with the requirements of the UK Patents Act 1977. This not a surprising decision for reasons that will be set out below, and it is consistent both with the earlier UK court decisions, and with the decisions of other jurisdictions around the world where Dr. Thaler has argued his case. The decision has, however, sparked interest in the questions of artificial intelligence and its ability both to \u201cautonomously\u201d devise inventions and to subsequently own them.\nJanuary 21, 2024, 12:15 PM\n3\nOn Thursday, October 26, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a limited exclusion order (LEO) and cease and desist order against Apple, potentially barring the technology company from importing Apple Watches into the United States. The ITC found Apple violated section 337 by importing Apple Watches that infringed on two Masimo patents that covered technology related to reading blood-oxygen levels.\nOctober 29, 2023, 02:15 PM\n3\nNumerous letters have been submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in recent weeks regarding the Office\u2019s decision to retire Private PAIR and EFS-Web, the two main software systems used by patent applicants, on November 8. The organizations are urging the agency to delay the transition due to numerous bugs and missing features. Groups that have weighed in so far include the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), the National Association of Patent Practitioners (NAPP), the Patent Center Listserv, Patent and Trademark Attorney, Agents and Applicants for Restoration and Maintenance of Integrity in Government (PTAAARMIGAN), and hundreds of individual patent professionals.\nNovember 5, 2023, 12:15 PM\n21\nAn interesting tale of intrigue and woe is being written in the decade-long relationship between Google and Sonos. The most recent chapter ended with the district court finding the Sonos patents at issue in their patent litigation against Google were unenforceable due to laches because Sonos had the audacity to file a continuation and seek claims supported by\u2014and actually incorporated from\u2014an earlier filing. According to the district court, because Sonos could have filed those claims in the continuation earlier, that created a laches defense for Google.\nNovember 2, 2023, 04:15 PM\n18\nIn the spirited world of whiskey, legal battles ferment in the form of trademark litigation. In the vast realm of whiskey production, where brands are as carefully crafted as the spirits themselves, clashes over trademarks have become common. The legal complexities swirling within the whiskey industry encapsulate the struggles of renowned manufacturers to protect the unique identities they have painstakingly cultivated for their whiskey brands. From the nuances of trade-dress like labelling and branding, to shape marks for detailed bottle designs, whiskey companies engage in multifaceted litigations to safeguard their trademarks.\nJanuary 20, 2024, 12:15 PM\n0\nThis week in Other Barks & Bites: the Federal Circuit issues a precedential ruling affirming the International Trade Commission\u2019s domestic industry requirement analysis, among other issues; Mariah Carey asks court to dismiss \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d copyright lawsuit; Trader Joe\u2019s loses its trademark lawsuit against employee union; and IBM cancels its employee invention reward program.\nJanuary 19, 2024, 02:15 PM\n1\nAt the end of 2023, Law 14,785/2023 was published in Brazil\u2019s official gazette, creating a new regulatory framework for chemical pesticides and environmental control products. The result of decades of discussions in the National Congress, the new law brings provisions that represent improvements to the system, such as the mandatory use of risk analysis in the process of granting registration of products and the requirement to harmonize with internationally established standards.\nJanuary 19, 2024, 07:15 AM\n0\nApple confirmed to media outlets on Monday that it will halt sales of certain Apple watches following the October International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling issuing a limited exclusion (LEO) order against the products. In its October ruling, the ITC found Apple violated section 337 by importing Apple Watches that infringed on two Masimo patents that covered technology related to reading blood-oxygen levels.\nDecember 18, 2023, 01:15 PM\n2\nOn October 30, President Joe Biden issued an executive order (EO) announcing a series of new agency directives for managing risks related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The EO prioritizes risks related to critical infrastructure, cybersecurity and consumer privacy but it does not establish clear directives on copyright issues related to generative AI platforms that have garnered much debate in Congress in recent months.\nOctober 31, 2023, 12:15 PM\n2\nOn November 13, global investment banking firm BTIG filed a lawsuit\u00a0 in California state court against rival company StoneX Group, alleging trade secret and breach of contract claims related to a StoneX\u2019s recruitment of several key BTIG employees in order to gain access to valuable proprietary software code developed at BTIG.
