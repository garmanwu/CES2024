In 2023, TSA screened a record 858+ million passengers, an average of 2.4 million daily passengers at airport security checkpoints across the country. In 2023, TSA set a new record by screening 2.9 million passengers the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while seven of the ten busiest days in TSA\u2019s history took place in 2023.\n\u201cI am very proud of the work we accomplished together as an agency and with our partners in 2023, starting with the long-awaited goal of paying our employees fairly, at the same levels as their federal counterparts,\u201d said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. \u201cAt TSA, from our employees behind the scenes to those on the frontlines, we have built a culture of innovation and remain focused on staying ahead of the emerging threats. We have deployed new technology to improve security and the passenger experience, and look forward to continuing the progress this year with our incredible partners across government and industry.\u201d\nIn 2023, the TSA workforce:\nAs adversaries adapt their tactics and new threats arise, TSA\u2019s law enforcement arm continues to adjust approaches to transportation security to meet and defend against these threats, namely:\nFor more information and additional accomplishments, see the TSA 2023 Year in Review.\n###\n2023 Year in Review: TSA highlights a year of innovation and improvements to security effectiveness, efficiency and the passenger experience\nFooter Top\nTSA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security"

Open Architecture is a technology-design approach for software and hardware that uses widely accepted standards to ensure interoperability across tools and platforms regardless of the technology designer, manufacturer or supplier. This approach increases the number of available partners who can supply improved technology quickly and at a lower cost.\n\u201cOpen architecture directly supports TSA\u2019s mission and its workforce, while further protecting the nation\u2019s transportation systems,\u201d said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. \u201cThis roadmap outlines how TSA will prioritize agile and flexible technologies that strengthen our ability to quickly develop, test, deploy and maintain new capabilities. All future contracting efforts for TSA\u2019s airport security screening solutions will require vendors to provide equipment or software that comes from a common software framework, is interoperable, can be easily upgraded and is resilient to emerging cybersecurity threats.\u201d\nTSA\u2019s Open Architecture Roadmap outlines four main goals:\nTSA has a history of supporting OA concepts dating back to 2010, including working in partnership with industry partners to establish the first security image data standard. During the past five years, TSA has accelerated its efforts related to OA and is well positioned to take the next steps to operationalize mature OA concepts while applying lessons learned from other government efforts and TSA\u2019s innovation experience.\nTSA\u2019s OA vision is a connected transportation system of systems in which state-of-the-art solutions are quickly adopted to address emerging threats and enables a dynamic screening environment. TSA develops roadmaps and implementation plans to articulate a common vision for the TSA enterprise and our partners. The roadmap\u2019s themes and objectives align with the Administrator\u2019s Intent, released on July 6.\nFor more information, read the Open Architecture Roadmap.\n###\nTransportation Security Administration publishes Open Architecture Roadmap\nFooter Top\nTSA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security"

Our goal with the Doctrine was to reinforce the fact that creativity, ingenuity, and invention are rewarded; reinforce TSA\u2019s culture of innovation.\u201d\nThere are four key objectives in publishing the TSA Innovation Doctrine:\n\u201cOne of the key purposes of the Doctrine was to establish almost a \u2018bill of rights\u2019 across TSA to give cover to invent, change, or innovate freely,\u201d says McCoy. \u201cFrom the leadership side it says \u2018we expect everyone across the agency to think about ways to improve the mission through innovation. This is what we believe is the best way to do that\u2019. For the workforce it\u2019s a mechanism to hold leaders and peers accountable to say \u2018I\u2019m trying to improve the mission or experience per this guidance, in these ways, with this support. I expect the space to do so\u2019.\u201d\nBy publishing the document externally, the idea is also that air transportation partners, legacy and emerging, bring more creative, inventive, and unique solutions to TSA, as partners. \u201cMany of the principles outlined in the Doctrine, such as \u2018take risks\u2019 or \u2018fail fast\u2019 are more standard practice in commercial groups,\u201d McCoy explains. \u201cThe ecosystem in many ways helps reinforce those principles at TSA through specific programmes and partnerships.\u201d\nBringing ingenuity, creativity, and innovation to the TSA\u2019s work\nOne of the hallmarks of the Doctrine is that it does not first and foremost set a single office as the \u2018innovation\u2019 group. \u201cHaving one group focus on innovation means you\u2019re creating a bottleneck such that you\u2019ll never outpace your adversaries, technology changes, or pure externalities like COVID-19,\u201d says McCoy.\nHe explains that the largest impact on creating more innovation throughout TSA is by creating more innovators within its ranks. \u201cThe Doctrine \u2013 along with programmes like our Design Thinking Cohorts, LinkedIn Learning training, and facilitated innovation training \u2013 taps into more of TSA\u2019s workforce predisposed to want to bring ingenuity, creativity, and innovation to their work.\u201d\nThe Doctrine also aims to facilitate teams at airports, across different functions, to build their own innovation pipelines. \u201cThat ability to self-generate innovative ideas, projects, and pilots means each group can work with local partners \u2013 such as small businesses, start-ups, colleges and universities \u2013 with a vested interested in the community,\u201d McCoy notes.\nThis is best seen in the creation of TSA LIFT Cells, outlined in the Doctrine, which are Local Innovation for TSA (LIFT) teams at over 25 airports across the U.S. Each team is supported by the Chief Innovation Officer\u2019s office and airport Federal Security Director, with local staff responsible for leading innovation at the local level. \u201cThe folks in the LIFT Cell receive training, documentation, and tools to manage their own pipeline and educate others at their airport,\u201d says McCoy. \u201cIn September 2022 the first annual \u2018LIFT Summit\u2019 was hosted in Los Angeles, where all the LIFT teams co-located for three days to learn, collaborate, and network.\u201d\nTSA Innovation Pipeline: \u201chow all innovations are best identified and scaled\u201d\nAn important element of the Doctrine is the TSA Innovation Pipeline. TSA views problem-solving activities as an end-to-end process and its Innovation Pipeline is designed to enable the creative ingenuity of the workforce, while engaging with partners to solve complex problems through innovation.\n\u201cI believe if any organisation has an enterprise level system for innovation, and a leadership core that supports real innovation, that agency or company will naturally make innovation repeatable and scalable,\u201d McCoy comments. \u201cThe TSA Innovation Pipeline sets that repeatable process for innovation and is designed to be adaptable to the size and scope of any challenge or opportunity so that it can be leveraged at the local or national level. Whether it\u2019s the LIFT team at LAX working on breakaway barriers in response to input from local law enforcement and K-9 teams, or deploying a new scheduling application for all 440 federalised airports, the pipeline is how we believe all innovations are best identified and scaled.\u201d\nFuture Travel Experience has a close working partnership with the TSA around our FTE Global event. During this year\u2019s FTE Global in Las Vegas, the TSA Innovation Task Force led guided tours and delivered a briefing to showcase the latest iteration of the future checkpoint site running at Harry Reid International Airport, which is trialling new machines, and new approaches, to gather data and feedback on whether the technology is something TSA would like to use at airports nationwide. FTE Global 2023 moves to Los Angeles, taking place at Long Beach Convention Center on 19-21 September 2023.\nCalling on innovators and early adopters to lead change\nFollowing publication of the TSA Innovation Doctrine, the ambition now is to start creating more organic innovation and solutions across the agency. \u201cThe Doctrine is many things, but primarily it\u2019s a call to action and \u2018bill of rights\u2019 to the workforce,\u201d says McCoy. \u201cTSA for years has expanded the capabilities, trust, and professionalism of the diverse workforce, now it\u2019s calling on those innovators and early adopters to lead change. Democratised innovation means we\u2019re staying agile ahead of threats, and solutions best align to problem owners.\u201d\nThe follow-up will involve more integration with inter-governmental innovation groups and peers. Building a common lexicon and action means TSA can syndicate projects, investment, technology, and talent better with these peers. McCoy adds that it will also include growing the base of innovators and early adopters across the enterprise. \u201cIf you believe the standard diffusion of innovation theory, the Doctrine is really trying to protect and enable that first 15% of innovators and early adopters \u2013 the folks already keen to take risks, build pilot programmes, test new concepts, and really push back on the \u2018we\u2019ve always done it this way\u2019 mentality. If that cohort is successful and rewarded for their efforts, it de-risks innovation for the agency as a whole. At that point, that\u2019s when the culture change is inevitable.\u201d\nMARK YOUR DIARY FOR FTE\u2019S EVENTS\nComments are closed.\nFTE Events and Activities Schedule\n17 Jan 2024\nFTE BIWG: Virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Proof of Concept (PoC) update, New Member presentations, Peak Holiday Lessons Learned\n24 Jan 2024\nFTE Hub: Virtual members meeting\nContent plans: AI, IOT & Robotics case studies & knowledge sharing\n28-29 Feb 2024\nFTE BIWG: Face-to-face members meeting in Tampa / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Proof of Concept (PoC) update, Sustainability, Tagging and Tracking and new member presentation.\n28-29 Feb 2024\nFTE Hub: Face-to-face members meeting in Tampa / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: AI, IOT & Robotics case studies & knowledge sharing\n14 March 2024\nFTE WARWG: Virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Progressive digital retailing strategies from around the world\n20 March 2024\nFTE BIWG: Virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Proof of Concept (PoC) update, baggage tracking advancements, and new member presentation.\n13 March 2024\nFTE Hub: Virtual members meeting\nContent plans: AI, IOT & Robotics case studies & knowledge sharing\n15 April 2024\nFTE Hub: Face-to-face members meeting in Frankfurt alongside Passenger Terminal Expo / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: AI, IOT & Robotics case studies & knowledge sharing\n15 April 2024\nFTE BIWG: Face-to-face members meeting in Frankfurt alongside Passenger Terminal Expo / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Fraport presentation, autonomous operations, and sustainability.\n14 May 2024\nFTE Hub: Face-to-face members meeting in Pittsburgh alongside FTE Aviation & Robotics Summit / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: AI, IOT & Robotics case studies & knowledge sharing\n14 May 2024\nFTE BIWG: Face-to-face members meeting in Pittsburgh alongside FTE Aviation & Robotics Summit / virtual members meeting\nContent plans: Pittsburgh International Airport presentation, Autonomous operations & Robotics POC updates.\n14 May 2024 -

        "raw_content": "TSA to Modernize, Expand CX Tech in 2024\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plans to expand and modernize several of its customer experience (CX) technology initiatives in 2024.\nAccording to the agency\u2019s annual high-impact service provider (HISP) plan, TSA will deploy new programs \u2013 like a virtual assistant at tsa.gov \u2013 and expand on existing initiatives like facial recognition technologies.\nAccording to the document, TSA has committed to expand its mobile driver\u2019s license pilot to two additional states and one additional platform in 2024. TSA will expand the pilot for mobile driver\u2019s license or digital ID at TSA checkpoints from seven to nine states, and from five to six platforms, giving more passengers digital ID options.\nTSA said it will also double the number of airports that use facial recognition for Precheck, from five to 10 locations. The agency also plans to roll out a new round-the-clock virtual assistant to help answer customer inquiries.\nFinally, the agency announced it will hire four CX strategists to oversee improvements at pilot airports to improve the customer experience of passengers, to include checkpoint experiences and airport-specific communications, training of TSA officers on customer interactions, and managing customer feedback insights.\nAs a HISP, the agency said it focuses on service assessments, collecting customer feedback, and making measured improvements for two designated services: completing the TSA passenger screening and getting help from TSA.\nAccording to the agency, TSA screens over two million passengers and their property each day and over 750 million passengers annually at over 440 federalized airports to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce across the country. The document highlights that the TSA Contact Center receives two million contacts annually; TSA\u2019s social media team, 2.1 million contacts; and TSA\u2019s website, four million contacts.\nTracking with President Biden\u2019s executive order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government from December 2021, TSA highlighted some CX accomplishments in 2023.\nFor example, the agency said it delivered biometric screening technologies to improve security and efficiency of passenger checkpoints as well as trained staff in how CX supports security to improve passenger experience.\nCongress has taken an interest in TSA\u2019s use of facial recognition technology as of late, most recently introducing the Traveler Privacy Protection Act of 2023 to prohibit TSA from using facial recognition technology or facial matching software \u201cin any airport unless such use is expressly authorized by an Act of Congress.\u201d\nCategories\n\u0394"

Thank you for inviting me to testify on the President\u2019s Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 President\u2019s Budget Request, which includes a $10.4B request for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). I am honored to be here and am grateful for the longstanding and constructive partnership TSA enjoys with this Subcommittee and all the support you have provided over the years.\nFirst and foremost, I would like to thank the Committee and Congress for the funding to support our workforce in the FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This was not only the right thing to do by our workforce, but we believe it will help with retention and recruiting in ways that will have a measurable impact on mission performance.\nI would also like to thank Congress for the authorities it has provided to TSA through the TSA Modernization Act of 2018 as well as appropriations that have enabled us to execute our mission and make significant progress on our strategic priorities. Additionally, I would also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the superior efforts of the entire TSA workforce, convey what they have accomplished, and explain our future goals and objectives. During the last year, TSA:\nTSA\u2019s vision is to remain agile, embodied by a professional workforce that engages its partners and the American people to address current and future challenges and threats to the Homeland. To that end, within the first year of my term as Administrator, I issued the \u201cTSA Strategy\u201d and established three strategic priorities to guide the agency\u2019s workforce through its 25th anniversary: (1) Improve Security and Safeguard the Nation\u2019s Transportation System; (2)\nAccelerate Action; and (3) Commit to Our People. I have twice published Administrator\u2019s Intent documents delineating and updating the short and medium-term goals and objectives to achieve those strategic priorities. I will publish the third iteration of the Administrator\u2019s Intent, in close consultation with your staff and our stakeholders, which will focus on the 20 most critical cross- cutting issues that require collaboration across the entire agency with senior executive accountability. The Administrator\u2019s Intent 3.0 is aligned with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s priorities as well as national strategies and directives including the National Security Strategy, the National Cybersecurity Strategy, and the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.\nWe have also strengthened our partnerships across the spectrum\u2014from private industry, to foreign partners and international organizations, advisory committees, academia, state and local governments, and our federal partners\u2014in order to increase collaboration, security, information sharing, and maximizing the customer experience in the new travel environment while minimizing negative impacts on travelers and commerce.\nSecuring and safeguarding the Nation\u2019s transportation system requires innovative tactics to address cybersecurity threats and risks associated with the continued integration of advanced electronic and networked systems. The FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget includes an increase of\n$10.4M for cybersecurity staffing, as well as the development and implementation of enhanced cybersecurity-related measures to improve cyber resiliency across the U.S. Transportation Systems Sector. Across the transportation sector, TSA continues to help partners build cyber resilience and improve incident response, focusing on the surface, rail, and aviation sub-sectors. With those stakeholders, TSA hosts a variety of planning meetings, intelligence briefings, and\ntabletop exercises to ensure partners are aware and prepared to respond to emerging issues. I have personally visited pipelines and other critical infrastructure operators to discuss the evolving cybersecurity threat, and to understand the challenges and successes of implementing the current security directives and program amendments.\nThis year, as required by Congress, TSA will deliver for the first time an unconstrained Capital Investment Plan that describes an ideal future state in which TSA is able to buy down more risk to the transportation sector with additional resources. It is imperative that TSA continues to invest in, acquire, and field new technologies to strengthen transportation security.\nThe transportation sector will remain a top target for malicious actors including international and domestic terrorists due to the prevalence of soft targets within the sector, the public accessibility of many transportation modes, and the importance of transportation infrastructure to the Nation. The agency carefully monitors this evolving threat environment and the need to strategically manage risks. Risk-based decision making is inherent to the TSA\nmission of protecting the Nation\u2019s transportation systems to ensure the freedom of movement for people and commerce. The challenges and risks TSA encounters will foreseeably become more complex, and the agency needs to position itself to be both more strategic in responding to risks and in developing solutions. A critical dependency in risk mitigation is sufficient funding that would allow TSA to continue to evolve transportation security in high-risk areas.\nIn conjunction with the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget, the Administration offers two proposals to increase availability of funding to resource TSA\u2019s strategic priorities and help TSA address emerging threats. First, it includes a legislative proposal to terminate TSA\u2019s deficit reduction contributions from Passenger Fee collections, which, if enacted, will provide an\nadditional $1.6B to directly offset TSA\u2019s appropriated funding and return the funds to use for their intended purpose. Second, the Budget includes a legislative proposal to transition access control at exit lanes to airport authorities and commercial airports under federal regulatory authorities, which will result in a projected savings of $111.0M. If approved, TSA will work with airports to integrate exit lane security into their perimeter security plans and assess those plans regularly. The proposal will enable TSA to better focus its resources on screening functions and risk-based security measures.\nTSA\u2019s level of success is influenced by the help of Congress as well as our professional, vigilant, and engaged workforce. That is why \u201cCommit to Our People\u201d is one of our three strategic priorities. The initial funding the Committee provided in FY 2023 to TSA allows for that continued commitment. The FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget includes $1.4B to fully support the TSA workforce pay initiatives started in FY 2023.\nThe strategic priority of \u201cCommit to Our People\u201d also entails ensuring that we provide our workforce with the necessary advanced technology to be successful. Today\u2019s evolving threats require a dynamic and responsive TSA. Access to greater technology enables our passenger screening workforce to assess potential threats quickly and efficiently and also supports a more seamless experience for the traveler. To that end, the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget includes $70.4M and $11.0M to procure additional systems within the Checkpoint Property Screening System (CPSS) and Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) programs, respectively, to address capability gaps to detect new and evolving threats to civil aviation in current property screening technology reliably and efficiently, while improving the customer experience. Our field officers have done a tremendous job being diligent by monitoring the\nthreats at the checkpoint. However, it is imperative that we equip them with the necessary tools to combat those persistent threats. As of today, TSA needs a total of 3,585 CAT and 2,263 CT machines to reach Full Operational Capability (FOC). Currently, CPSS procurements are an estimated 35 percent of FOC, which puts deployments at approximately 28 percent for CPSS and 57 percent for CAT. Based on past, present, and current projected funding, TSA will meet FOC for CAT machines and CPSS in FY 2049 and FY 2042, respectively. Full and dedicated funding for CPSS and CAT are imperative for our nation\u2019s security at the checkpoint.\nFurthermore, there are a number of investments in Operation and Support that require sustained funding to ensure the transportation sector stays secure. Some of these investments include:\nAs you know, TSA was established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act in the wake of the September 11th attacks and was given the urgent task of protecting our nation\u2019s transportation systems. Since that day, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to provide the highest level of security across all modes of transportation and work with our partners to stay ahead of evolving threats. In the years since 9/11, and specifically over the past fiscal year, TSA has not only had to address ever-present physical threats to aviation, but also dynamic and\nemerging cybersecurity threats to our nation\u2019s aviation, rail, as well as hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline infrastructure. TSA works closely with the transportation industry to provide agile and responsive security across all modes of transportation through passenger and cargo screening, vetting and credentialing personnel in critical transportation sectors, law enforcement, regulatory compliance, and international cooperation.\nToday, within the aviation network, TSA is responsible for the security of over 430 federalized airports, with screening services forecasted this summer for over 22,000 domestic flights (at pre-pandemic levels) and nearly 2,300 outbound international flights per day. With travel volume rebounding, TSA routinely screens more than 2 million passengers, 5 million carry-on bags and 1.4 million pieces of checked baggage daily for explosives and other dangerous items, and in many locations across the nation. TSA expects passenger volume to eventually exceed our pre-pandemic FY 2019 levels, which averaged up to 2.3 million per day. The FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget includes $197.1M to enable TSA to continue to recruit and retain a workforce able to meet increasing demands of passenger travel volume and maintaining\nsecurity effectiveness. In addition to these core security functions, we also ensure regulatory compliance in aviation through the work of more than 1,285 aviation, cargo, and surface transportation security inspectors.\nIn the surface realm, TSA works closely with transportation system owners and operators to protect the critical surface transportation systems that connect cities, manufacturers and retailers and power our economy through more than 4 million miles of roadways; nearly 140,000 miles of railroad track; more than 470 tunnels; and over 2.8 million miles of pipeline. TSA\u2019s security inspectors conduct approximately 8,000 surface inspections annually in pursuing a risk- based approach for securing a large and complex network of transportation systems and critical infrastructure.\nSince TSA\u2019s creation, the modes and methods of terrorist attacks have become more decentralized and opportunistic, and aviation and other transport hubs remain high-value targets. Threats to aviation and surface transportation are persistent and constantly evolving. To meet these challenges, we must continue to be responsive, innovate, rapidly deploy new solutions, and maximize the impact of our resources.\nThe FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget aligns with TSA\u2019s strategy to improve security and safeguard the nation\u2019s transportation system, accelerate action, and reinforce TSA\u2019s commitment to advancing its strategy. Thanks to Congress\u2019 support for TSA through the FY 2023 enactment, the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget honors commitments to our workforce by providing appropriate compensation and other benefits while addressing capability gaps to ensure that the nation\u2019s transportation security remains the safest in the world.\nSecuring our nation\u2019s transportation system is a complex task that requires robust partnerships and a well-trained, dedicated workforce. Funding in the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget will have a positive impact on all TSA employees\u2014from Transportation Security Officers, Federal Air Marshals, inspectors, canine handlers, analysts, and management to administrative and professional employees\u2014as well as on transportation security and the passenger experience. To achieve the priorities reflected within the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget, we will continue to engage with industry and stakeholders, invest resources in our employees and technology, and encourage the public to be part of the solution. Finally, through constructive oversight and dialogue, we seek to continue to partner with Congress as we work to secure all modes of transportation for the public.\nChairman Joyce, Ranking Member Cuellar, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I strongly believe that the TSA priorities outlined in the FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget are not only necessary but timely and vital to our economy. As always, we will be very responsive to addressing any questions that you might have throughout this budget process and I look forward to this discussion and your questions. Thank you.\nFiscal Year 2024 President\u2019s Budget Request for the Transportation Security Administration\nFooter Top\nTSA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security"

        "raw_content": "Astounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nThe world's biggest consumer tech show lets us dream of a Jetsons-style world where these futuristic concepts come to pass.\nLooking to the future\nCES 2024 is a candy-colored box of goodies. While you can certainly buy some of the wares at the show, some of the most intriguing tech concepts trumpeted at CES are visions of the future we wish were already real. (Others were straight-up wacky.) Here's what's sparking our imagination.\nTalking, color-changing BMW\nRemember KITT, the talking car from Knight Rider? It's getting closer to reality thanks to Dee, a talking, color-changing BMW concept car displayed at CES. It will listen and respond to commands from curbside, as well as remotely via a smartphone app. Plus, the concept's exterior skin is covered with new full-color E Ink technology that can instantly shift between up to 32 colors, allowing you to generate patterns and multicolor schemes on the fly to customize your ride.\nSelf-service airport screening pods\nAirport security lines are never fun, and they can be so long they result in travelers missing their flights. Thankfully, the Transportation Security Administration is testing a new self-service system that could let you complete the screening process on your own. The self-service screening pods are for TSA PreCheck passengers to use as individual screening consoles. When a passenger steps inside the screening pod, they show their ID and the machine will begin scanning them and their bags. Each station includes a video monitor with step-by-step instructions. The prototype that's being shown at CES this week is the Micro-X self-screening system.\nJackery solar Mars bot and rooftop camper\nJackery displayed two concept items -- one more practical than the other. The company showed off a \"Mars rover\" with solar panels. The Solar Generator Mars Bot is like a portable power station on wheels with solar panels sliding out of the sides to capture more sunlight, somewhat like NASA's Opportunity Rover, with power outlets. And a more practical item on display was the company's rooftop camper tent. Solar panels mounted inside the hardshell roof of the pop-up tent and extending wings of panels can provide power through one of the company's power stations, running plenty of camping equipment for long journeys.\nKia's Lego-like concept vehicles\nKia debuted three concept vehicles at CES 2024: the PV1, PV5 and PV7, the automaker's new Platform Beyond Vehicle family. They are electric vans that can be customized to move products, serve as work or living spaces, be converted to modular pop-up stores, and operate with or without a driver behind the wheel. Think Legos for vehicles -- they can be reconfigured almost at will.\nHyundai's steering tech\nThe Hyundai Mobion concept vehicle moves unlike any other vehicle you've probably seen. The newly developed eCorner steering technology uses advances in robotics technology to allow the vehicle to move laterally, rotationally, and do all sorts of crazy things. The wheels can be moved independently, but also in multiple different configurations. The car can even crab walk, and it can do rear-wheel steering on a level that we've almost never seen before. Hyundai hopes to begin shopping the tech around in 2025 or so.\nQuantum dot-powered TV of the future\nNanosys has created a prototype 12.3-inch nanoLED screen that could be thinner, brighter and more efficient than OLED. What's nanoLED, you ask? It's a technology based on electroluminescent, aka \"direct-view\" quantum dots, and its screens boast improved picture quality, energy savings and manufacturing efficiency. While the screens can't quite be made in TV size yet, the new prototypes are big enough for tablets, small laptops and automotive uses.\nHyundai's electric air taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the CES debut of the Supernal S-A2. Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing Supernal displayed its new, second-generation S-A2, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, air taxi. It'll take to the air as early as 2028, the company said.\nDoublepoint Android watch software\nA Finnish startup created some impressive software, called Doublepoint, that turns your smartwatch running Android's WatchOS into a kind of remote control you can wear on your wrist.\nIt makes your watch a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection. You may be able to dim your lights, scroll Netflix or do any number of other things.\nHisense projector concept car\nHisense doesn't make cars, but the company is demonstrating its laser TV in-car technology at CES. CNET's\u00a0David Katzmaier calls it\u00a0\"basically a drive-in movie theater built into your car.\" There's a laser projector right on the front bumper -- you could project a movie straight from your car onto a flat surface, like your garage door. Inside the car, you can turn the windshield into an information hub, allowing drivers to simultaneously observe virtual images and the real environment.\nSamsung transparent micro-LED\nTransparent OLED\u00a0and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, but Samsung says its micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the going tech. That means you should be able to see through it more easily to objects on the other side.\nOne intriguing use: One day, you could be in a luxury box at an athletic event or concert looking through this transparent micro-LED glass. Scores, replays and highlights could appear on the \"windows\" and augment the experience of the game without obscuring it. (You're still on your own for getting those luxury box tickets, however.)\nSamsung's flip phone concept\nSamsung's Flex In & Out Flip concept is like a Galaxy Z Flip you can fold in both directions. Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and other flip phones you can buy today, it folds completely backward so that you use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nLG DukeBox\nIf you've ever wanted to sync up The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the LG DukeBox might be just the device for you. It's a 360-degree speaker with a transparent OLED panel at the front to show off the tube amplifier inside. LG says the screen can be used to watch movies or \"create a cozy fireplace ambiance where the vacuum tube is visible amidst the flickering flames.\"\nLG concept car\nLG has a car? It's just a concept for now, but this futuristic beauty features completely autonomous driving, seats that turn completely around, and of course, plenty of screens. It also works with LG's smart home system, and there's a video game system and concierge station that holds a wine bottle. AR displays give you information on businesses you're passing as the car drives you around.\nSamsung rollable OLED\nImagine\u00a0Samsung's flexible rollable OLED display technology\u00a0inside your car. These screens offer small, unobtrusive displays when you're driving, but when you need to charge your electric vehicle, you can fold out the screen to a larger size for movie watching or playing games. It folds right back up to the size of a chunky highlighter when you're done.\nStained glass solar panels\nThink you know what solar panels look like? Think again. This crystal isn't just an art object but a solar panel capable of turning sunlight energy into power. Extra points for not looking like a giant, unsightly black box.\nProject Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept for a gaming chair cushion. Project Esther, an add-on cushion unveiled at CES, is the first demonstration that Razer has offered of the new technology, which comes via its acquisition of Interhaptics in 2022. It straps on to a chair and creates sensations to let you feel as if you're really experiencing the game you're playing.\nPanasonic's novel solar cells\nPanasonic has a plan to one day turn walls and windows into solar energy. The new solar technology, perovskite, uses different materials than traditional silicon solar panels. The fact that the materials are printed onto walls and windows means Panasonic can manufacture components at much lower temperatures -- which saves energy -- and the solar cells themselves have the potential to one day capture as much energy as traditional solar panels, if not more.\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda gave CES attendees their first peek at its next generation of battery electric cars, the Honda 0 (pronounced \"zero\") series, expected to launch in the US in 2026. Shown here is the\u00a0sharply styled 0 Series Saloon, the flagship model.\nIt will be joined by the more upright and van-shaped Honda 0 Space-Hub, featuring a transparent canopy and center-facing bench seats.\nMore Galleries\nSteak Toasters, Indoor Smokers and Robot Cocktails: All the Kitchen Tech of CES 2024\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nThe Rabbit R1 AI Assistant Looks Downright Retro in Orange\nOnePlus 12 and 12R Have an Elegant but Familiar Design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\n17 Hidden iOS 17 Features and Settings on Your iPhone"

Thank you for your leadership and your service.\nTSA\u2019s mission is vast and embedded in the principle that transportation security is national security.\nEstablished in the immediate aftermath of September 11th, 2001, TSA works to combat dynamic threats across this nation\u2019s transportation systems and protect the traveling public.\nIn order to carry out that mission in a robust and effective manner, the resources this Committee provides to TSA must prioritize innovative and transformative solutions to the security challenges we face today. Unfortunately, Administrator, I\u2019m not\u00a0sure the President\u2019s 2024 budget request meets that mark.\nThe budget request for TSA is nearly $1.6 billion dollars above the fiscal year 2023 enacted level.\nThe single largest line-item increase in the budget request is $1.1 billion dollars for pay increases for the TSA workforce.\nI appreciate the dedication and service to our nation that Transportation Security Officers show each and every day and believe they should be paid fairly, but also recognize the significant budgetary challenges that this poses, especially in the current fiscal environment.\nThe budget request also woefully underfunds investments in new, more capable technology at airport checkpoints.\nFor example, Computed Tomography technology is able to render 3-D images of carry-on baggage, providing TSOs with a greater ability to identify potential threats at the checkpoint while increasing the speed and efficiency of passenger screening.\nHowever, the budget request includes only $70 million for this technology\u2014which is $35 million less than the amount that was provided in fiscal year 2023. At the current rate in the budget, TSA will not be able to fully deploy these systems across the United States until 2042.\nCompounding these budgetary challenges is that the Administration has yet again resorted to budget gimmicks, assuming unauthorized fees as an offset for TSA\u2019s appropriation.\nCoupled with the 1.1 billion dollars in pay increases, the Administration has created a huge hole in TSA\u2019s budget\u2014to the tune of 2.8 billion dollars.\nThe Committee will need to take a hard look at the entirety of TSA\u2019s\u2014and the Department\u2019s\u2014budget and balance these proposals against other funding requirements.\nAdministrator Pekoske, I look forward to your testimony today, and working with you throughout the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process.\nBefore I turn to our witness for his statement, I would like to recognize our Ranking Member, Mr. Cuellar, for his opening remarks.\nSubcommittees"

        "raw_content": "Statement by Secretary Mayorkas on the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2024 Budget\nThe FY 2024 Budget invests in border security, cybersecurity, maritime security, natural disaster recovery and resilience, and other critical DHS missions.National Press ReleaseThursday, March 9, 2023\nThursday, the Biden-Harris Administration released the President\u2019s Budget for Fiscal Year 2024, which provides $60.4 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and an additional $20.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to address major disasters.\n\u201cThe threats facing the homeland are more diverse and complex than they were twenty years ago, when the Department of Homeland Security was first created. The President\u2019s Budget seeks to protect the security of the American people amidst a very dynamic threat environment,\u201d said\u00a0Secretary of Homeland\u00a0Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. \u201cThis budget invests in programs that protect us against the threat of terrorism here and from abroad, strengthen the security of our borders, ensure the swift response to and recovery from natural disasters, and so much more. It equips our Department to address the threats of today and prepare for the threats of tomorrow.\u201d\nAt the Department of Homeland Security, the Budget will:\nModernize Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Pay and Workforce Policies.\u00a0The FY 2024 President\u2019s Budget honors previous promises to compensate the TSA workforce at rates comparable to other Federal workers. Enhancements to TSA pay support the President\u2019s and Secretary Mayorkas\u2019s commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workforce. The Budget includes $1.4 billion to ensure TSA employees are paid at a level that is comparable to counterparts on the General Schedule pay scale.\nInvest in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Protection.\u00a0The President\u2019s Budget supports the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s (CISA) mission to protect our cyberspace and serve as the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience. Building upon investments made in FY 2023, an additional $149 million results in a total of $3.1 billion dedicated to programs reinforcing cybersecurity and infrastructure security. Of note, $98 million is provided to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) and $425 million for the new Cyber Analytics Data System which is a robust and scalable analytic environment capable of providing advanced analytic capabilities to CISA\u2019s cyber operators.\nInvest in Climate and Natural Disaster Resilience.\u00a0The Budget provides for the allocation of resources to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to strengthen the ability to prepare for and respond to disasters of various magnitudes. The Budget includes $4.0 billion for FEMA climate resilience programs, over a $150 million increase from the FY 2023 enacted budget. As part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to address climate change, the Department will invest in programs to reduce pollution and protect public health. The DHS Budget includes $123 million to support integrated investments into Zero-Emission Vehicles and charging infrastructure.\nModernize Coast Guard Operational Capability and Presence in the Arctic Region.\u00a0As a maritime nation, the United States depends on a strong and agile Coast Guard to enhance the nation\u2019s maritime safety, security, and economic prosperity. The President\u2019s Budget provides $12.1 billion in net discretionary funding to sustain readiness, resilience, and capability while building the Coast Guard of the future. The Budget continues efforts for the Coast Guard\u2019s highest acquisition priorities, and includes $579 million for the Offshore Patrol Cutter program and $55 million to advance the Great Lakes Icebreaker acquisition \u2013 an asset ensuring America\u2019s continued economic prosperity on our domestic waterways. The Budget also includes $170 million for a third new Polar Security Cutter and $150 million to purchase a commercial polar icebreaker\u00a0for Coast Guard operations. These assets will also increase access to the Arctic region and strengthen the United States\u2019 presence in polar waters, a critical national security priority.\nHelp Secure the Border and Build a Safe, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System.\u00a0The President\u2019s Budget provides the resources to continue securing our border and support a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system. The Budget provides $865 million for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process increasing asylum caseloads, address the backlog of applications for immigration benefits, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing. It invests $535 million in U.S. Customs and Border Protection for border technology, to include $305 million for Non-Intrusive Inspection Systems, with a primary focus on fentanyl detection at ports of entry. It also provides $113M to hire additional personnel, for an increase of 350 Border Patrol Agents and 150 Customs and Border Protection Officers, as well as an additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and ICE and 39 positions to strengthen the Transportation and Removal Program. The Budget also provides $40 million to combat human smuggling as well as illicit drug operations such as the production and distribution of fentanyl through the Repository for Analytics in a Virtualized Environment (RAVEN), to help special investigative units disrupt and dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and their networks.\nSupport 2024 Presidential Campaign Security.\u00a0The Budget provides a total of $3.0 billion in net discretionary funding to support the protection and investigation missions of the United States Secret Service. To prepare for the upcoming 2024 Presidential Campaign, the budget includes $191 million to ensure that the 2024 Presidential Campaign is adequately resourced for the protection of major candidates, nominees, their spouses, and nominating conventions.\nLess than two years after 9/11, 22 agencies and 180,000 public servants came together with a mission to safeguard the American people and our way of life. 20 years later, the Department of Homeland Security has grown in size, capability, and complexity. As new threats emerge with increasing speed, our work to reinforce our homeland security has never been more important to our national security.\nLatest in Airports\nLow-Carbon Flights Are Approaching.

Additionally, TSA officers stopped more than 6,500 firearms at airport checkpoints.\n\"I am incredibly proud of our dedicated TSA employees who perform the critical task of securing our nation's transportation systems each day,\" said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. \"We had a very successful year that ended with the enactment of the FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, which included funding to bring TSA employee compensation to a level commensurate with other federal employees, in addition to funding to expand collective bargaining rights for our non-supervisory screening workforce. For years, our employees have not been paid fairly, and securing pay parity was necessary from an operational standpoint as we continue to see increasing travel volumes, and will also help our ability to recruit and hire new employees and retain the talent we have.\"\nDuring 2022, TSA achieved the following highlights and accomplishments:\nOUR SECURITY OPERATIONS\n20 years of federalized security: TSA recognized the 20th year of checkpoint federalization as more than 400 airports nationwide reached this milestone anniversary.\nTechnology improvements:\u00a0TSA improved security effectiveness and reduced physical contact by deploying 534 Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) units and adding 243 Computed Tomography (CT) X-ray scanners at airport checkpoints. The FY23 Omnibus Bill, which President Biden signed into law in December 2022, will enable technology deployments to continue across the agency's nearly 2,400 security checkpoint lanes to raise the bar on identity verification and security efficiency, accommodate future improvements in liquids screening and take initial steps for screening at speed.\nCybersecurity resilience efforts:\u00a0TSA worked with industry partners to revise previous rail and pipeline Security Directives and issue performance-based pipeline Security Directives to enhance cybersecurity resilience for the nation's critical pipelines and rail systems. Performance-based criteria recognizes the diversity of organizations and systems that exist throughout the transportation sector and seeks to incorporate practices that strengthen those systems against attack.\nOfficers stopped a record number of firearms:\u00a0TSOs prevented more than 6,542 firearms\u00a0from entering the secure areas of airports in 2022; 88% of the firearms were loaded. TSA also announced several new measures to mitigate firearms threats including enhanced screening for passengers in possession of a firearm at a TSA checkpoint and loss of TSA PreCheck\u00ae\u00a0eligibility for up to five years. In December 2022, TSA also increased the maximum civil penalty for a firearms violation to nearly $15,000.\nFederal Air Marshal Service 60th Anniversary:\u00a0In March 2022, TSA recognized its Federal Air Marshal\u00a0Service (FAMS) for 60 years of protecting domestic and international flights and providing a visible security presence for surface transportation modes. The FAMS was initially founded as part of the Federal Aviation Administration in 1962 in response to increased international airline hijacking incidents, and transitioned to TSA after its establishment following the 9/11 attacks.\nExpanded canine teams:\u00a0TSA trained and deployed more than 1,000 explosives detection canine teams at airports and mass-transit facilities to support large-scale events such as Super Bowl LVI, the Kentucky Derby, Indy 500 and enhance security operations at airports and surface transportation systems nationwide.\nAnnounced open architecture initiative: TSA partnered with Airports Council International (ACI) - Europe to begin piloting open architecture airport security technology. Open architecture offers agility in technology development, adoption and updates, promoting competition and improving security and the traveler experience.\nTSA Insider Threat: Executed a multimedia insider threat awareness campaign, increasing workforce knowledge of potential risk indicators of an insider threat and reporting streams; expanded TSA office and program membership within the TSA Insider Risk Mitigation Hub and increased external domestic and international transportation stakeholder and partner outreach efforts. The agency also continued advancement of TSA Insider Threat with the deployment of a case management system and threat data analytics.\nGlobal incident management: TSA supported Operation Allies Welcome with the safe transport of over 90,000 people from Afghanistan to the U.S. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, TSA continued to lead cybersecurity efforts as a sector risk management agency for transportation.\nOUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS\nPassenger volumes continue to recover:\u00a0Travel volumes returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, with TSOs screening 736 million passengers, averaging over two million passengers per day. On average, 99.4% of passengers waited less than 30 minutes at airport security checkpoints, while 99.4% of passengers in TSA PreCheck lanes waited less than 10 minutes.\nTSA PreCheck reduced enrollment fee:\u00a0Seven new airlines joined the TSA PreCheck expedited screening program and over 3.3 million people enrolled, bringing the total number of active TSA PreCheck members to more than 14 million. The agency also reduced the initial enrollment cost to $78 and renewal cost to $70.\nFirst TSA PreCheck at an international checkpoint: In February, TSA opened its first TSA PreCheck lanes outside of the U.S. making its debut in Nassau, Bahamas.\nTSA improved the passenger experience:\u00a0The TSA Contact Center answered 1.9 million traveler calls and email messages; AskTSA responded directly to 2.2 million traveler questions, typically within two minutes, over social media and introduced a new feature enabling airline passengers to text AskTSA (275-872) with security-related questions. The TSA Cares helpline provided assistance to 46,000 travelers with disabilities, medical conditions and other special circumstances. Additionally, TSA implemented enhanced screening technology, improving the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) units\u00a0in airport checkpoints with a software update that enhances accuracy and efficiency. Through a partnership with Apple, TSA also continued to test the acceptance of mobile driver's licenses to enable a more seamless airport security experience for travelers in participating states including Arizona, Maryland and Colorado.\nCollaboration and strategic partnerships:\u00a0TSA conducted over 500 domestic response plan exercises; provided self-defense training for airline employees; offered truck, port and rail workers online options to securely renew credentials and increased intelligence sharing with surface and aviation partners.\nTSA leveraged innovation and identity management:\u00a0TSA published its Innovation Doctrine\u00a0to highlight how the agency embeds innovation into its business processes. Additionally, TSA issued an Identity Management Roadmap, outlining a cohesive identity management approach that enhances standards, improves data sharing and privacy protocols across systems and expands collaboration efforts among stakeholders to improve the traveler experience.\nTSA introduced its virtual Mission Hall:\u00a0In November 2022, TSA launched a virtual tour of TSA's Mission Hall, which is located at TSA headquarters. The exhibit is a collection of historical archives and artifacts documenting the agency's establishment, its evolution and critical events in transportation security.\nOUR PEOPLE\nIncreased compensation for TSA employees:\u00a0In late December 2022 President Biden signed into law the FY23 Omnibus Bill, which was a top priority for DHS and TSA, that includes funds to pay TSA employees at a level commensurate with other federal agencies. The new compensation plan will begin in July 2023 and recognizes the critical role TSA employees play in protecting the nation's transportation systems.\nExpanded collective bargaining rights for non-supervisory screeners:\u00a0The FY23 Omnibus Bill included funding to support implementation of an expanded labor framework, including broad collective bargaining rights for the non-supervisory screening workforce. On December 30, 2022, Administrator Pekoske signed a new Determination on Transportation Security Officers and Collective Bargaining that sets forth this new labor framework. The spending bill also included funding for continued Merit Systems Protection Board rights for TSOs. The agency first established these rights for TSOs in September 2021.\nTSA hired a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility Officer:\u00a0TSA hired its first-ever executive officer to lead diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives for the agency. The Chief Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Officer is responsible for designing, developing, and recommending a diversity management strategy that aligns with and contributes directly to TSA's mission and strategic goals.\nTSA continues to hire and train officers:\u00a0TSA hired more than 10,000 new TSOs and opened its new TSA Academy West adjacent to Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) in Las Vegas. The new training academy graduated over 1,000 TSOs while others were trained at the TSA Academy East in Glynco, Ga. TSA offered a hiring bonus for TSO positions in some areas of the country where it is hard to recruit applicants and provided an opportunity for candidates to onboard as Security Support Assistants (SSA) within just a few weeks. The SSA position allows candidates to quickly obtain employment at TSA to perform non-screening duties in support of checkpoint operations, while they complete the TSO hiring process.\nThe Transportation Security Administration was created to strengthen the security of the nation's transportation systems and ensure the freedom of movement for people and commerce. TSA uses an intelligence-based approach and works closely with transportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to set the standard for excellence in transportation security.

But the days of taking off shoes and emptying bags might be soon ending. The Department of Homeland Security is experimenting with a security self-screening system similar to a supermarket self-checkout, and the new system will be implemented for select passengers for the first time at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas this year. Depending on the response, self-screening could become widespread, changing air travel entirely.\nA new way to travel\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) wants to increase airport efficiency by putting security screenings in passengers' hands. The Screening at Speed (SaS) program is \"developing technology that would enable the scanning of walking passengers, acquiring data through most garments and reliably detecting a wider range of prohibited items regardless of concealment,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security. SaS program manager Dr. John Fortune explained in a statement, \"Travelers will use passenger and carry-on screening systems at individual consoles or screening lanes themselves, reducing the number of pat-downs and bag inspections TSOs (Transportation Security Officers) need to perform and freeing their time to be reallocated to the busier aspects of screening operations.\" The system, not surprisingly, is expected to reduce wait times at security checkpoints.\nThe new SaS system will be tested at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas starting in January 2024. Only TSA PreCheck passengers will be eligible to use the SaS technology for now. Based on passenger response, changes could be made to expand usage. \"The ultimate goal of this is that it is all one-stop,\" Jeffrey C. Price, professor of aviation and aerospace at Metropolitan State University of Denver, told The Washington Post. \"You go in and you show your ID. It scans you, it scans your bags, you leave your little kiosk and off you go to the plane.\" Fortune added, \"Self-service screening is a big step toward creating novel, innovative solutions to build the airport of the future.\"\nSubscribe to The Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

If there is something you have forgotten to divest \u2026 then the back gate doesn't open. It tells you to go back and take it out of your pocket and then come back in.\" Three different companies worked on prototypes for the self-screening mechanisms.\nThe TSA is still testing the prototypes to determine the most user-friendly one. Price explained that \"there's going to be a massive learning curve with this,\" for both TSA personnel as well as passengers. Las Vegas is not the first location to test the machines. Over the past year, various prototypes were tested at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and in Atlantic City, and others will be tested in 2025. \"We are very excited to see how far these capabilities have come in a relatively short amount of time,\" Christina Peach, branch manager for the TSA Innovation Task Force said in a statement. \"The airport security experience that we've all come to know could soon look and feel a lot different \u2014 in a very good way.\"\nWhile the new technology could revolutionize travel protocol, budget could be an issue. \"The big challenge for TSA is money,\" T.J. Schulz, president of the Airport Consultants Council explained to the Post. \"They just don't have the money to fully develop and deploy these advanced technologies.\" The systems along with their implementation are expected to cost more than $1 billion. Forbes commented, \"In an environment where TSA often seems to be under fire for some shortcoming \u2014 poor performance on tests for detecting weapons, making the experience confusing and unpleasant for travelers and, especially, its expensive bloat \u2014 the new equipment may not satisfy critics.\"\nContinue reading for free\nWe hope you're enjoying The Week's refreshingly open-minded journalism.\nSubscribed to The Week?
