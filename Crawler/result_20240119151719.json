With support for up to three 140mm fans in the front, side, bottom, and rear of the case, and an additional two at the top, it goes without saying that Thermaltake wanted to make sure that cooling was not an issue with this case. And if you don\u2019t want to utilize quite that many fans, you can use the glass front panel on the case, as opposed to the included mesh front panel and front fan bracket. The large glass panels, as well as the top and rear panels, are all tool less, which makes accessing the inside of the case that much easier. Like we previously mentioned, this case is built with big time hardware in mind, so there is room for up to EATX motherboard and the latest top-end graphics cards. Additionally, a PCIe riser cable and vertical GPU mounting bracket are included with the case to allow for additional mounting options if you don\u2019t want to use the standard layout. The CTE E600 will be available right away in both black and snow, with a special 25 year Hydrangea Blue available soon, for just $179.99.\nTower 300\nNext up is another case in Thermaltake\u2019s Tower series, the Tower 300, and I must say, this thing looks pretty amazing. While the Tower 300 does have some similarities with regards to the look of previous Tower series cases, Thermaltake has applied an octagonal layout to this case, with angled corners on each side, as opposed to just 90-degree corners. On the front of the case, this translates into a single removable glass panel on the front, with two thinner panels flanking it \u2013 all of which are easily removable with push-style mechanisms. Two CT140 fans will be included with the Tower 300, but there is actually room for a total of eight 140mm fans, as well as up to a 420mm radiator on the right side of the case. At the top of the case is an easily removable cover that provides access to a hinged fan door, giving way to the interior of the top of the case without the need to disconnect any cables from any top mounted fans. The Tower 300 will be available on January 14th in both black and white versions, with many different colors to follow, including our favorite, Matcha Green. Expect to see the Tower 300 priced at $149.99.\nAdditionally, an optional case stand will be made available that places the case on its side for a very unique look. Along with this stand will come an alternate bottom cover for the Tower 300 so that you get a symmetrical look when in this configuration. No word on the availability of this stand just yet, but expect it to come in somewhere between $29.99 and $39.99.\nASTRIA ARGB Sync Coolers\nThermaltake was also showing of a trio of new tower coolers at CES 2024, and each one targets a different cooling performance level. Each of these coolers sports an 18-LED ARGB illuminated top cover, as well as a 120mm High Airflow ARGB Sync Fan (two fans in the case of the ASTRIA 600). All three of these coolers will be available on February 23, 2024.\nASTRIA 200 ARGB Sync \u2013 This single-tower design cooler utilizes four copper heat pipes in a U-shape configuration in order to cool CPUs with TDPs up to 210 watts. The ASTRIA 200 ARGB Sync will retail for $34.99.\nASTRIA 400 ARGB Sync \u2013 Using six copper heat pipes in a single-tower layout, the ASTRIA 400 is designed to cool CPUs up to 230 watts in TDP. The ASTRIA 400 ARGB will retail for $44.99.\nASTRIA 600 ARGB Sync \u2013 With six copper heat pipes across a dual tower design and two fans, the ASTRIA 600 is designed to handle CPUs with TDPs up to 265 watts. The ASTRIA 600 will retail for $69.99.\nOur CES 2024 coverage is brought to you by Yeyian!\nYou May Also Like\nThinkComputers \u00a9 2024. All Rights Reserved."
