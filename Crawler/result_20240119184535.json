And during this time, the supply of integrated circuits (ICs) has been taken for granted. However, disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic, combined with shifts in demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the need for technology for working from home, fluctuations in the automotive sector, the deployment of 5G infrastructure, a push for hardware for artificial intelligence \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have highlighted the importance of the IC industry in both our daily lives and the global economy1.\nThe IC industry is made up of a complex mix of business models and suppliers. Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), such as Intel and Samsung, design, fabricate and sell their own ICs. But there is also a split business model \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or fabless\u00e2\u20ac\u201cfoundry model \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in which fabless design companies, such as MediaTek, design and sell ICs, but outsource their manufacture to IC foundries, such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), who only provide manufacturing services. Both approaches remain successful, but the split approach has grown more rapidly over the last 20 years. And notably, the traditional IDM, Intel, has recently announced the launch of its own foundry services2.\nTaiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor industry holds a leading market share in IC foundry, packaging and testing services, and is second only to the US in terms of design services and broader market share. Its success can be traced to strong government support during the early stages of the industry, a focus on developing technical skills and know-how, and being pioneers of the fabless\u00e2\u20ac\u201cfoundry model. In a Focus in this issue of Nature Electronics, we explore how Taiwan became a leading player in the global electronics industry.\nIn a Comment article, Meng-Fan Chang and colleagues highlight that back in the 1970s the Taiwanese government recognized the potential economic importance of the semiconductor industry and developed a strategy to ensure Taiwan had the technology and the engineering expertise to build a domestic supply chain. Initially, the government focused on enabling technology transfer from the US, setting up research institutes and centres, and then supporting spin-off companies. Later, as companies began to attract their own investments, the government focused on providing grants, subsidies and tax incentives to support academia, research institutes and industry. This has continued to this day, and support remains heavily focused on advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nWhen the semiconductor industry first emerged in Taiwan, what it could offer in terms of designs, intellectual property, and research and development capabilities was limited. But its fabrication plants performed well. In 1985, Morris Chang, while working at Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), was asked by the government to draft a plan to create a new competitive semiconductor company. Recognizing Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength in IC fabrication, he proposed a new, pure-play foundry business model: a company with no designs of its own, but who manufactured ICs for fabless design companies or IDMs when they needed it. In 1987, he founded TSMC, which is now the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest pure-play IC foundry.\nIn a further Comment article, Bor-Sung Liang, a senior director at MediaTek, examines how Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IC design industry has evolved over the last 50 years or so. Key to its success has been an ability to identify and supply fast-growing technology sectors, and to work with customers to bring their ideas to fruition. By developing designs and intellectual property to meet the growing demand for personal computers, and then mobile handsets and smartphones, the Taiwanese IC design industry had, by 2019, become an industry with revenues of US$22.4 billion.\nThe success of emerging technologies \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from artificial intelligence to robotics to quantum computing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d will depend on innovative IC designs. As Taiwan has learnt, the semiconductor industry is a costly business that requires sustained investment, and such investment will need to continue in order to supply the IC products that these emerging technologies require. But Taiwan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor industry is well placed to meet these demands \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and holds lessons for those looking to join them.\nReferences\nFitch, A. & Koh, E.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nChina to lead semiconductor industry expansion with 18 new fabs in 2024 \u2014global chipmaking capacity to reach record heights\nChina builds more new fabs than other countries.\nThe SEMI World Fab Forecast report\u00a0anticipates\u00a0a 6.4% increase in capacity in 2024, reaching over 30 million wafer starts\u00a0per month (wpm).\u00a0Driven by serious government funding, China is predicted to lead the world in expanding semiconductor production, with a total of 18 new fabs expected to begin production in 2024.\nThe rather substantial 6.4% increase in wafer processing capacity\u00a0follows a 5.5% rise to 29.6 million\u00a0WSPM\u00a0in 2023. The expansion is primarily driven by developments in leading-edge logic\u00a0by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Foundry, as demand for processors aimed at artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications continues to grow rapidly.\nSEMI expects as many as\u00a082 new fabs\u00a0to go online\u00a0from 2022 through 2024, which includes 11 projects slated for 2023 and an ambitious 42 projects in 2024. These new facilities will\u00a0use\u00a0a range of wafer sizes from\u00a0100mm to\u00a0300mm\u00a0and dozens of mature and leading-edge process technologies, indicating a diverse expansion across the semiconductor industry.\nChina is poised to lead this expansion, bolstered by government funding and\u00a0various incentives for chipmakers. In 2023, Chinese chip manufacturers are forecasted to grow capacity by 12% year-over-year (YoY), reaching 7.6 million\u00a0WSPM.\u00a0This growth is\u00a0projected\u00a0to accelerate to\u00a013%\u00a0in 2024,\u00a0reaching\u00a0a capacity of 8.6 million\u00a0WSPM. A total of 18\u00a0new fabs\u00a0are\u00a0expected\u00a0to\u00a0start\u00a0operations in China in 2024.\nOther regions are also contributing to the increase in global\u00a0chip production\u00a0capacity. Taiwan is set to remain the second-largest region in semiconductor capacity, with a projected increase to 5.4 million\u00a0WSPM\u00a0in 2023 and 5.7 million\u00a0WSPM in 2024.\u00a0South\u00a0Korea and Japan follow, with\u00a0South\u00a0Korea expected to reach 5.1 million\u00a0WSPM\u00a0in 2024. The Americas, Europe, Mideast, and Southeast Asia are also gearing up for growth, with each region launching several new fabs\u00a0in 2024.\nIn terms of specific segments within the semiconductor industry, the foundry suppliers are forecasted to lead in equipment purchases, increasing their capacity to a record 10.2 million\u00a0WSPM\u00a0in 2024. Despite a slowdown in 2023, the memory segment,\u00a0including\u00a0DRAM and 3D NAND, is expected to increase capacity gradually. The discrete and analog segments, driven by vehicle electrification, are also projected to grow significantly, highlighting the diverse and dynamic nature of the global semiconductor industry's expansion.\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Read our policy.\nSubscribe now for 2024\nEscalation in Taiwan could cause further semiconductor crisis in 2024\nBy Megan Kelly2024-01-09T16:01:00+00:00\nThe escalation of tensions in Taiwan could cause a further semiconductor shortage in the year ahead, presenting a risk to automotive logistics.\nTaiwan accounts for 38.9% of the world\u2019s share of semiconductors, worth $138 billion in export value\nTensions and regulatory frictions are rising in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election in Taiwan, on January 13. One of the prominent issues in the election race is focused on relations with China, whose president Xi Jinping is focused on the \u201creunification\u201d of Taiwan with China. The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, but it claims the territory as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China, while an increasing number of the population identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.\nThe growing pressure could lead to Taiwan being a primary conflict hotspot in 2024, according to predictive insights firm Everstream Analytics. In a risk report, Everstream said that additional policies are lined up to limit exports for semiconductors, adding that \u201cany escalation, whether cyberattacks, a naval blockade, military drills, or a full-scale invasion [of Taiwan], would prove devastating to global supply chains\u201d.\nTaiwan accounts for 38.9% of the world\u2019s share of semiconductors, worth $138 bn in export value. In an invasion scenario, Everstream said it would cost an estimated $350 billion (\u00a3274 billion) over three years to replace Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor capacity.\nA further risk highlighted by Everstream is that more commodities and products are getting caught up in heightening trade wars, particularly between the US and China. Growing export controls and sanctions will force companies to search for new technology suppliers to avoid disruptions. These restrictions from the US to China now include export controls on semiconductor production equipment out of the Netherlands and Japan.\nAs a result, Everstream predicts that investment in semiconductor facilities will shift toward the US this decade, with an estimated $190 bn investment in fabrication plants in the USA by 2030.\nAside from the impact on the automotive industry\u2019s supply of semiconductors, disruption in the Taiwan Strait would impact an estimated half of all the world\u2019s container ships that pass through it, according to Everstream.\nThe analytics company advised logistics firms to begin preparing strategies that could mitigate the potential effects of disruption in Taiwan, including building up alternative suppliers outside of the region, adjusting levels of buffer inventory and securing air cargo capacity. In the most extreme case of an attempted invasion, Everstream said logistics firms should stockpile critical components and build up alternative suppliers in the region and beyond.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is known as the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world (Source: TSMC, Ltd.)\nHowever, the political situation in Taiwan is not the only risk that threatens the automotive logistics and supply chain industry globally in the year ahead.\nEverstream Analytics said that the risk of cyberattacks on the industry will remain high in 2024. In its report, Everstream found that cyberattacks on supply chains rose sharply during 2023, up 202% year on year. This is the highest level in the last five years, surpassing the previous record during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, and the analytics firm said it is not slowing down.\nIn 2023, cyberattacks primarily hit the logistics sector, including trucking firms, ocean carriers, rail companies and airlines, accounting for a total 17% of attacks across all industries. The automotive industry accounted for a tenth of all cyberattacks across all sectors and carmakers were not exempt from the impact.\nBillion-dollar weather events, which the US experienced every four months in the 1980s, are now occurring every three weeks, and Everstream said this impact will increase as the \u2018Era of Extremes\u2019 persists in 2024.\nWeather events are the top logistics disruptor for supply chains, as could be seen throughout last year when the Panama Canal experienced its worst drought since record began in 1950. The analytics firm predicts that improvement isn\u2019t likely in the first four to five months of the year because of the late December dry season, which is causing draft height restrictions and daily vessel transit limits to worsen. With longer waiting times, bulk carriers, freighters and tankers will be feeling the affects most, and some shipping operators may choose to avoid the Panama Canal entirely as a result. Others will reroute via the Suez Canal, Everstream predicts, but with recent Houthi attacks, container ships and ro-ro operators are now avoiding the Red Sea too.\nREAD MORE:\u00a0DIGITAL COMPETENCY IS NEEDED TO PREDICT THE UNEXPECTED\nIn response to the drought affecting the Panama Canal, Mexico\u2019s government is reviving the trans-isthmus railway between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean as an alternative for container traffic. The interoceanic railway is planned to run for 303 km, with the main line set to go between ports at Salina Cruz, Oaxaca and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. President L\u00f3pez Obrador, who said he plans to have the project running by next September, opened the first section of the railway (known as Line Z) in late December.\nOn top of droughts, winter storms are also expected to worsen and affect the automotive logistics industry this year. With global ocean temperatures at record highs and a rising trend in disruptive winter weather, there is a greater risk of more impactful storms.\nTo minimise the impacts of droughts, storms and floods, logistics firms should closely monitor routes for approaching disruption, leveraging predictive weather forecasts and disruptions alerts along with predictive ETAs.\nTopics\nRelated articles\nMaersk opts for land bridge due to Panama Canal drought\n2024-01-11T16:08:00Z\nBy Megan Kelly\nRed Sea blog: Live updates\n2024-01-10T11:15:00Z\nBy Megan Kelly\nAn automotive supply chain in transition \u2013 the year in review\n2023-12-19T12:12:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams\nBMW\u2019s digital strategy for better supply chain visibility\n2023-11-07T13:08:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams\nFVL capacity constraints likely to remain across North America\n2023-10-19T13:29:00Z\nBy Daniel Harrison\nPowerCo and Umicore JV Ionway appoints Philip Fimmers as supply chain head\n2024-01-17T15:24:00Z\nBy Megan Kelly\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nMore Supply chain management\nStellantis picks president of Mexican division for North America COO\n2024-01-16T13:08:00Z\nBy Megan Kelly\nStellantis has appointed Carlos Zarlenga to replace Mark Stewart as chief operating officer for North America.

Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

David Joined Lam Research in June \u00a02016 and is currently Managing Director of Strategic Marketing in Lam\u2019s Customer Support Business Group.\nTopic: Enabling Specialty Technologies and Advanced Packaging Solutions to Improve the Functionality and Performance of Electronic Systems\nAs technology node scaling becomes increasingly complex and expensive, an increasing number of semiconductor manufacturers and foundries are turning to the development of specialty technologies and advanced packing solutions to deliver increased system functionality and performance whilst managing development costs.\nSpecialty technologies such as sensors (MEMS, CIS and IR Sensors), RF Devices, optoelectronics, advanced power semiconductors (MOSFETs and IGBTs), and Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) power management ICs are key to enabling applications in consumer electronics, automotive electronics, IoT applications and cellular communications; including 5G. This trend means that by 2023 these specialty technologies will account for approximately 30% of all global IC demand1.\nAt the same time, this high cost of scaling single ship solutions is also driving development of heterogeneous chip integration using advanced packaging. These heterogenous integration schemes are focussed on bringing together multiple chips and functions in a single package. While conceptually very similar to multi-chip modules, recent developments deploy a strategy of using advanced wafer manufacturing technologies to meet the ever-increasing performance and form factor requirements.\nThis presentation will talk about the trends in specialty technologies and heterogenous integration through advanced packaging as well as how the technical challenges associated with these applications can be addressed by high volume CMOS manufacturing solutions.\nDr. Wei-Chung Lo\nITRI, Deputy General Director of Electronic & Optoelectronic System Research Laboratories (EOSL)\nDr. Lo received his Ph.D. from National Taiwan University, and joined Industrial Technology Research Institute to work in advanced electronic packaging, such as 3D IC/3D stacking, fan-out, heterogeneous integration technology for more than 20 years, 85papers, and 27 patents granted.\nDr. Wei-Chung Lo\u2019s major research interests are advanced packaging, intelligent power module, embedded chips in Flex/substrate (Chip in film/substrate), heterogeneous integrated module, and now especially, he is the leader of heterogeneous integration (AI on Chip project, 3D fan-out interconnect/3D SiP program) in ITRI and chief secretary of the Heterogeneous Integration consortium, Advanced Stacked-System Technology and Application Consortium (Ad-STAC), a multinational research association led by ITRI. Currently, he serves as the chairman of Technology working Group of IoT chapter, Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap (HIR).\nComing soon\u2026\nKevin Kuo\nNI, GM Taiwan Branch\nKevin Kuo graduated from Queen\u2019s University Canada with a Honored bachelor degree in Computer Engineering.

He have marketing management experiences in China and Taiwan, also having sales management experiences at APAC level. He currently manages key accounts and act as general manager for NI Taiwan.\nTopic: The Future of Semi Test \u2013 Applying Digital Transformation Technologies to Semiconductor Product Development\nDigital transformation applies not only to IT organizations, e-commerce, or data clouds, but also to technologies that improves how semiconductor organizations design, test, and manufacture semiconductor products.\u00a0 In this presentation, we will share the latest trends and technologies that best-in-class semiconductor companies are using to accelerate and improve product designs.\u00a0 More specifically, we will discuss examples of how companies are leveraging technologies ranging from remote automation to clouds and AI in order to transform modern engineering labs and enterprises.\nMarkus Rossi\nams AG, VP, Head of Innovation Office\nMarkus Rossi has a master degree in physics and a PhD in micro-optics. He was co-founder of the company Heptagon which developed into a major supplier for micro-optical solutions in mobile phones and smartphones. Heptagon was acquired by ams early 2017 where Markus has built up an interdisciplinary team for 3D system solutions. He is now head of the Innovation Office of ams AG.\nTitle: VCSEL Innovations for 3D Sensing Applications & Technologies\nVCSELs (vertical cavity surface emitting lasers) are key components for various 3D sensing applications. Innovations in various aspects of VCSEL design, manufacturing, packaging and module technologies have been ignited by the on-going rapid deployment of 3D sensing use cases in consumer and automotive products. This talk outlines some of the key challenges, recent solutions and an outlook to next generation products.\nKoushik Banerjee\nIntel, VP Technology and Manufacturing Group\nKoushik Banerjee is a vice president in the Technology and Manufacturing Group at Intel Corporation and leads assembly and test technology integration. He is responsible for developing innovative, industry-leading packaging technologies for Intel products and transferring those technologies successfully into high-volume manufacturing. Banerjee collaborates with business units and product design teams to set a packaging roadmap that assures both technology leadership and affordability, with a focus on operational excellence in technology development program execution.\nBanerjee joined Intel as a packaging design engineer in 1991, shortly after completing graduate school. During the first 10 years of his Intel career, he held various management and leadership positions in packaging design, in the course of which he helped introduce several novel technologies. In 1996, his work on the successful transition from ceramic to organic packaging for microprocessors earned him an Intel Achievement Award. From 2002 to 2005, as substrate technology research line manager, Benerjee was responsible for path-finding in next-generation substrate and interconnect technologies. From 2005 to 2011, he served as the director of assembly module engineering, overseeing the development of next-generation packaging assembly technologies.\nBanerjee holds more than a dozen patents in the field of microelectronic packaging. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Jadavpur University in India and his master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology.\nTopic: Packaging Innovations\nThis talk will cover packaging innovations that are critical to enable complex products and the associated challenges.

He is involved in the market, technology and strategic analysis of the microelectronic assembly and packaging technologies. His main interest areas are advanced IC packaging technology including equipment & materials. He is the author of several reports on fan-out / fan-in WLP, flip chip, and 3D/2.5D packaging. He received the bachelor and master\u2019s degree in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee and University of Seoul respectively. He has published more than 40 papers in peer reviewed journals and has obtained 2 patents. He has presented and given talks at numerous conferences and technical symposiums related to advanced microelectronics packaging.\nTitle: Future of Fan-out WLP/PLP business: Myth vs Reality\nFan-out packaging is not new, and it has been adopted in mobile devices for more than 10 years. However, it has attracted lot of attention since 2015, when Apple adopted TSMC\u2019s InFO technology for iphone A10 application processor (AP). It was speculated, other key fabless players will soon adopt InFO or other high-density fan-out technology for flagship mobile AP by replacing laminate substrate-based flip-chip PoP. But it has not happened, even though already qualified by various fabless players. What are the reasons? Do we see other players adopt high density fan-out for mobile AP in near future? After a steady growth, we recently saw the decline in the low-density fan-out (eWLB type) business. What is the current status and prospect? TSMC is clearly emerged as the winner in the high-density fan-out with multiple design offerings. Is there any challenge to them from other OSATs /foundries/IDMs? What is the status of fan-out at other manufacturers? Fan-out PLP has also generated lots of interest and many players are working on it including tool/materials suppliers. Samsung /SEMCO started FO-PLP HVM with Galaxy watch AP. Will Samsung adopt FO-PLP for flagship phone AP? What is the FO-PLP status at other manufacturers (OSATS/IDMs)? Will the FO PLP business significantly increase in the coming years as ASE and PTI increase capex by bringing additional PLP capacity online? This presentation will try to answer these questions and overview the overall activity happening in fan-out WLP/PLP ecosystem.\nPeter A.
