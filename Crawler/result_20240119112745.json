He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\nShare this story\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance announced at the beginning of CES last week that it had begun certifying Wi-Fi 7 devices. Not having the certification doesn\u2019t mean a device won\u2019t work, but it does mean that it\u2019s been confirmed to work within the standard\u2019s specification and is therefore compatible with other Wi-Fi devices. Handily, the Wi-Fi Alliance has a searchable database of what\u2019s certified, and a few notable ones have already earned the Alliance\u2019s stamp of approval for the new standard.\nYou may already have a Wi-Fi 7 smartphone if you own the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Qualcomm\u2019s FastConnect 7800 network adapter, which is now certified for the new Wi-Fi standard, is included with Samsung\u2019s 2023 flagship phone. The only trouble is, to date, Samsung hasn\u2019t enabled the feature. It would be a significant upgrade if it did, though, even if it only gets half of the 5.8Gbps throughput that Qualcomm claims on its site (given a Wi-Fi 7 router and a fast enough internet connection, that is).\nIf you plan to buy a laptop this year, chances are good you\u2019ll end up with a certified Wi-Fi 7 Wi-Fi chipset in that, too. That\u2019s because of the Intel BE200 card that\u2019s in laptops that were announced at CES, like the new Razer Blade 16. It will also show up in others as the year wears on. Intel claims up to 5,800Gbps throughput on the 6GHz band with the BE800, just like Qualcomm\u2019s smartphone chip.\nWi-Fi 7 is the next version of Wi-Fi to follow Wi-Fi 6E. Like Wi-Fi 6E, the protocol works on the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, and it\u2019s backward-compatible with devices that precede it. Wi-Fi 7 promises faster throughput through features like 320MHz channel bandwidth, which is twice what\u2019s offered on Wi-Fi 6E; Multi-Link Operation, which combines bands into a single, faster, and more stable connection; and improved interference handling.\nThe standard hasn\u2019t yet been finalized, however, and there are no client devices \u2014 phones, laptops, and so forth \u2014 that support it, putting current Wi-Fi 7 routers very firmly in the early adopter market. Still, there may be some benefits from using Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems, which will be able to take advantage of the features listed above for faster, more stable wireless backhaul connections between nodes.\nOf the several Wi-Fi 7 routers on the market now, TP-Link\u2019s Deco BE85 mesh router and Archer BE800 are the only consumer-grade Wi-Fi 7 routers for sale that now appear on the Alliance\u2019s list. The Archer BE800 is a tri-band router with dual 10Gbps ports and two 2.5Gbps ports. It\u2019s also compatible with Wi-Fi EasyMesh, a brand-agnostic Wi-Fi mesh standard that should mean it works with any other EasyMesh router. The Deco BE85 is a dedicated mesh router that only uses TP-Link\u2019s proprietary mesh technology. You\u2019ll pay for either router, though \u2014 a two-pack of Decos is $999.99 while the Archer sells for $599.99.\nGoogle CEO tells employees to expect more job cuts this year\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is smarter, pricier, and just as big as ever\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck is having trouble living up to the hype\nSamsung is making a smart ring\nNotion\u2019s new calendar app is designed to keep your meetings organized\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from Tech\nFedEx is launching a new e-commerce platform as it competes with Amazon\nApple asks its San Diego Siri quality control team to relocate to Texas\nVision Pro demos will include scanning your glasses to identify your prescription\n\u2019Tis the season for AI apps and AI gadgets\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\nShare this story\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance is now officially certifying devices that support Wi-Fi 7, the next generation of wireless home internet. With certification, Wi-Fi 7 devices are guaranteed to interoperate, and in 2024, we will see new tech products like phones, laptops, and routers endowed with the standard, which could represent huge speed and efficiency gains compared to even Wi-Fi 6E.\nThe alliance says in its announcement that Wi-Fi 7 will be better than existing standards for things like high-bandwidth streaming and low-latency wireless gaming, and that\u2019s crucial as virtual reality gains popularity and people continue commuting to their kitchen tables or home offices to commune with co-workers over Zoom. Kevin Robinson, CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance, told The Verge that Wi-Fi 7 is the \u201cfirst generation built from the ground up\u201d for the 6GHz band \u2014 the faster, broader swath of wireless spectrum first used by Wi-Fi 6E devices.\nYou might be tempted to point out that Wi-Fi 7 routers already exist, and you\u2019d be right. Routers have already hit the market from companies like Netgear, TP-Link, and Eero, and the first two came months ago. They may or may not get certification \u2014 Eero\u2019s existing Wi-Fi 6 routers don\u2019t show up on the alliance\u2019s certified product finder. That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t work well with Wi-Fi 7 devices in the future, but certification allows companies to guarantee that they will.\nCertification aside, nothing\u2019s changed about Wi-Fi 7 since we published our guide on it in October. It still offers double the channel bandwidth \u2014 from 160MHz to 320MHz \u2014 versus the fastest devices on the Wi-Fi 5, 6, or 6E standards, and that means the potential for wireless downloads at over two gigabits per second.\nIt will also debut Multi-Link Operation (MLO), which is essentially wireless link aggregation \u2014 bonded connections spread across two or three of the 2.4 GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, giving you more speed and more stability since walking out of range of one band doesn\u2019t mean you have to reconnect to get on another.\nMLO also offers a latency benefit. Ordinarily, device connections are restricted by airtime \u2014 the time it takes for the router to cycle through others queued up to send packets over the network. Robinson told The Verge that with all three bands available simultaneously, there\u2019s \u201ca very, very high probability of getting that packet out immediately.\u201d\nThat could be a big deal if your network is pokey, although Robinson said not every router will necessarily support connecting to all three bands at once. A more affordable router may only connect two bands at a time, for instance. That\u2019s better than now, where the best routers still only support one connection per device, but if getting the full force of the Wi-Fi 7 standard is important to you, you\u2019ll probably have to spend more cash.\nThere are other bits and bobs of the new standard that the alliance says will mean more efficiency, throughput, and stability, and Wi-Fi 7 devices will be backward-compatible with previous versions of Wi-Fi. Older devices won\u2019t directly benefit from new features on a Wi-Fi 7 router, but it won\u2019t be long before new laptops and phones will. For now, though, it\u2019s more helpful to think of a new Wi-Fi 7 router as upgraded infrastructure \u2014 a plan for the future.\nGoogle CEO tells employees to expect more job cuts this year\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is smarter, pricier, and just as big as ever\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck is having trouble living up to the hype\nSamsung is making a smart ring\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s new goal is creating artificial general intelligence\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nTCL is releasing a giant 115-inch model of its excellent QM8 Mini LED TV.\nTCL is taking the CES stage next.\nLG TVs will soon be Google Home smart home hubs.\nThe hottest gadget of CES 2024 is a fictional headset.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wi-Fi 7 Is Now Official, Promising More Speed, Lower Latency\nOne small step from Wi-Fi 6, one giant leap for eliminating wireless congestion.\nI\u2019m the deputy managing editor of the hardware team at PCMag.com. Reading this during the day? Then you've caught me testing gear and editing reviews of laptops, desktop PCs, and tons of other personal tech. (Reading this at night? Then I\u2019m probably dreaming about all those cool products.) I\u2019ve covered the consumer tech world as an editor, reporter, and analyst since 2015.\nWi-Fi 7 is finally here. After more than a year of development, and with many products using \u201cdraft\u201d Wi-Fi 7 standards already on the market, Wi-Fi 7 received its certifcation from the Wi-Fi Alliance on Monday ahead of CES 2024, which makes it the official current version of the ubiquitous wireless networking technology.\nLike all major Wi-Fi versions, Wi-Fi 7 is backwards-compatible, so it will work with your existing Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 devices. However, if you have a Wi-Fi 7 phone or laptop connected to a Wi-Fi 7 access point (like a home router or mesh network), you\u2019ll in theory be able to experience once-unimaginable speeds and signal reliability.\nThat\u2019s thanks mostly to a new wireless connectivity protocol known as Multiple Link Operation (MLO), exclusive to Wi-Fi 7. Unlike many esoteric, jargon-filled wireless standards, MLO is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Instead of your phone connecting to your router over a single link (2.5GHz or 5GHz, for example) as it currently does, it can connect using both links simultaneously and transmit data over whichever one is currently the fastest. This advancement has the potential for increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved reliability compared with earlier Wi-Fi versions, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance, the main industry group that certifies Wi-Fi standards.\nOther advancements include support for 320MHz channel bandwidth, double the width of the widest currently available Wi-Fi channel. That can further increase throughput and support multi-gigabit speeds, the Wi-Fi Alliance said, although it may not advance reliability as much as MLO will.\nMany Wi-Fi 7 devices are already for sale or have been announced, from mesh routers like the Eero Max 7 to flagship phones like the OnePlus 12. The Wi-Fi Alliance expects more than 233 million individual Wi-Fi 7 devices to hit the market this year. Many of them will support all of the official Wi-Fi 7 protocols (including MLO and 320MHz channels), but Wi-Fi 7 certification is voluntary, so not every manufacturer will implement every feature. If you see a device with the \u201cWi-Fi 7 Certified\u201d logo, that\u2019s your best bet that you\u2019re getting a product with the future-proofed wireless standards.\nQualcomm, the California silicon giant that makes much of today's Wi-Fi circuitry, said that more than 200 Wi-Fi 7 client device models like phones, PCs, and VR headsets have launched or are planned using its FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi 7 chipset.\u00a0Meanwhile, more than 250 Quaclomm-powered access point models like mesh Wi-Fi systems have launched or are in development, according to the company, which sees MLO in particular as a revolutionary advancement.\n\u201cThe client can use all of the bands simultaneously, rather than using whatever initial band it connects to until that fails,\u201d said Andy Davidson, a Qualcomm engineer and member of the Wi-Fi Alliance\u2019s board of directors. That\u2019s a big advantage in crowded spaces like convention centers or airports where wireless congestion is rampant, Davidson said.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nWhat Does 'Wi-Fi 7 Certified' Mean for Consumers?\nSo what can you expect to change now that we\u2019re officially living in a Wi-Fi 7 world? Other than the logo appearing on more products, not a whole lot, actually. That\u2019s in part because many of the benefits that Wi-Fi 7 offers are exclusive to Wi-Fi 7 devices. Even if you have a Wi-Fi 7 phone, it can\u2019t take advantage of MLO or 320MHz when it\u2019s connected to your Wi-Fi 6 router, for example.\nAnother limitation is regulatory snafus that limit the potential of the 6GHz band, which is not exclusive to Wi-Fi 7 (a variant of Wi-Fi 6 known as Wi-Fi 6E also supports it), but is required to take advantage of 320MHz channel width. Nearly every router and mesh system PCMag has tested so far has shown far more limited range at 6GHz than at 2.4GHz or 5GHz. That could change once the US Federal Communications Commission approves a feature known as Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC). Until then, many devices will transmit and receive at lower power on the 6GHz channel, negating much of the benefit unless you\u2019re in very close proximity to the router\u2014essentially in the same room.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

In addition to faster speeds \u2014 Wi-Fi 7 will be up to four times faster than the previous version, Wi-Fi 6E \u2014 customers can look forward to new improvements like Multi-Link Operation, support for 320MHz channels for Wi-Fi networks, and 4K\u00a0Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. We can expect to see more Wi-Fi 7 compatible routers and devices arrive over the course of 2024.\nAccording to details shared by the Wi-Fi Alliance when it launched the latest IEEE standard on Monday, Wi-Fi 7 \u2014 or IEEE 802.11be \u2014 supports speeds of up to 40Gbps, which is four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E networks that offer a peak speed of 10Gbps. While Wi-Fi 7 is backwards compatible, it's worth noting that you will only be able to take advantage of the higher speeds if both your router and phone support Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.\nAnother major upgrade that is coming alongside Wi-Fi 7 is Multi-Link Operation (MLO). This feature is designed to cut down on latency while simultaneously boosting the stability of the Wi-Fi network, by allowing devices on the network to simultaneously transfer information and data over several frequency bands, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance.\nWi-Fi 7 also comes with support for wider channel bandwidth, which in turn boosts throughput on a network. You will be able to take advantage of a wider 320MHz bandwidth \u2014 up from 160MHz on Wi-Fi 6E networks. It also uses the new band, just like W-Fi 6E that was introduced in 2021, which will help to cut down on network congestion experienced on older Wi-Fi networks.\nMeanwhile, Wi-Fi 7 features another notable upgrade \u2014 4K\u00a0Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). On wireless networks, users will see up to 20 percent faster data transfer rates. Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-FI 6E networks offered support for 1024-QAM while decade-old Wi-Fi 5 standard arrived with 512-QAM.\nWhile new Wi-Fi 7 capable routers were announced at CES 2024, it could be a while before new devices that are compatible with the new Wi-Fi standard arrive. Some devices \u2014 include those powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 series chip and Intel's latest 14th Gen Core Ultra chips \u2014 already support Wi-Fi 7 networks.\nMeanwhile, Apple is expected to bring support for Wi-Fi 7 networks with its upcoming devices expected to debut later this year \u2014 this include the iPhone 16 Pro models, that are expected to be equipped with the company's next-generation chip.\u00a0Over 233 million Wi-Fi 7 devices are expected to enter the market this year, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance.\nFor the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

        "raw_content": "Wi-Fi 7 arrives in full early 2024, promises 5x speed boost over Wi-Fi\u00a06\nEarly adopter devices now available, Gigabyte shows off Wi-Fi 7 PCIe\u00a0adapter\nWhy it matters: Hardware vendors have been offering Wi-Fi 7 capable devices based on draft specifications for some time. The final release of the standard was anticipated for 2024 and with a clearer timeline now available, more manufacturers like Intel are expected to soon unveil products that utilize Wi-Fi 7's enhanced bandwidth and stability.\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance has confirmed that the final Wi-Fi 7 standard will be released before the end of the first quarter of 2024. It promises to deliver multi-gigabit speeds and other improvements compared to the current Wi-Fi 6 standard.\nIntel and Broadcom showcased Wi-Fi 7 speeds last year (also known as 802.11be) reaching up to 5 Gbps \u2013 significantly surpassing Wi-Fi 6's typical maximum of around 1.7 Gbps. Wi-Fi 7 achieves this by allowing seamless switching between the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz frequencies, which compatible devices can juggle simultaneously.\nAdditionally, the 6GHz spectrum offers access to 320MHz superwide channels, doubling the throughput compared to Wi-Fi 6 \u2013 a key factor in the speed increase. The new standard also enhances transmission rates by 20 percent by upgrading from 1024 QAM to 4K QAM.\nWi-Fi 7 connections are also expected to be more stable than previous specifications. The multi-link operation intelligently balances traffic, enabling networks to accommodate more devices efficiently. The Alliance suggests that the new standard will be ideally suited for augmented and virtual reality applications. The FCC's recent preliminary approval for ultrafast Wi-Fi tethering on the 6GHz spectrum is a significant step towards enabling VR and AR equipment to utilize Wi-Fi 7.\nThe 2024 launch date roughly matches Intel's predictions from 2022. The company plans to release Wi-Fi 7-capable PCs starting next year, with widespread market availability in 2025. Qualcomm is also optimistic about Wi-Fi 7, incorporating it into its FastConnect program alongside 5G.\nSince last year, other manufacturers have been jumping the gun using draft specifications, including the likes of Netgear, TP-Link, Asus, Amazon, and Gigabyte. Amazon launched the $600 Eero Max 7 router in September, boasting wireless speeds of up to 4.3 Gbps.

After more than a year of development, and with many products using \u201cdraft\u201d Wi-Fi 7 standards already on the market, Wi-Fi 7 received its certifcation from the Wi-Fi Alliance on Monday ahead of CES 2024, which makes it the official current version of the ubiquitous wireless networking technology.\nLike all major Wi-Fi versions, Wi-Fi 7 is backwards-compatible, so it will work with your existing Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 devices. However, if you have a Wi-Fi 7 phone or laptop connected to a Wi-Fi 7 access point (like a home router or mesh network), you\u2019ll in theory be able to experience once-unimaginable speeds and signal reliability.\nThat\u2019s thanks mostly to a new wireless connectivity protocol known as Multiple Link Operation (MLO), exclusive to Wi-Fi 7. Unlike many esoteric, jargon-filled wireless standards, MLO is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Instead of your phone connecting to your router over a single link (2.5GHz or 5GHz, for example) as it currently does, it can connect using both links simultaneously and transmit data over whichever one is currently the fastest. This advancement has the potential for increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved reliability compared with earlier Wi-Fi versions, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance, the main industry group that certifies Wi-Fi standards.\nOther advancements include support for 320MHz channel bandwidth, double the width of the widest currently available Wi-Fi channel. That can further increase throughput and support multi-gigabit speeds, the Wi-Fi Alliance said, although it may not advance reliability as much as MLO will.\nMany Wi-Fi 7 devices are already for sale or have been announced, from mesh routers like the Eero Max 7 to flagship phones like the OnePlus 12. The Wi-Fi Alliance expects more than 233 million individual Wi-Fi 7 devices to hit the market this year. Many of them will support all of the official Wi-Fi 7 protocols (including MLO and 320MHz channels), but Wi-Fi 7 certification is voluntary, so not every manufacturer will implement every feature. If you see a device with the \u201cWi-Fi 7 Certified\u201d logo, that\u2019s your best bet that you\u2019re getting a product with the future-proofed wireless standards.\nQualcomm, the California silicon giant that makes much of today's Wi-Fi circuitry, said that more than 200 Wi-Fi 7 client device models like phones, PCs, and VR headsets have launched or are planned using its FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi 7 chipset.\u00a0Meanwhile, more than 250 Quaclomm-powered access point models like mesh Wi-Fi systems have launched or are in development, according to the company, which sees MLO in particular as a revolutionary advancement.\n\u201cThe client can use all of the bands simultaneously, rather than using whatever initial band it connects to until that fails,\u201d said Andy Davidson, a Qualcomm engineer and member of the Wi-Fi Alliance\u2019s board of directors. That\u2019s a big advantage in crowded spaces like convention centers or airports where wireless congestion is rampant, Davidson said.\nWhat Does 'Wi-Fi 7 Certified' Mean for Consumers?\nSo what can you expect to change now that we\u2019re officially living in a Wi-Fi 7 world? Other than the logo appearing on more products, not a whole lot, actually. That\u2019s in part because many of the benefits that Wi-Fi 7 offers are exclusive to Wi-Fi 7 devices. Even if you have a Wi-Fi 7 phone, it can\u2019t take advantage of MLO or 320MHz when it\u2019s connected to your Wi-Fi 6 router, for example.\nAnother limitation is regulatory snafus that limit the potential of the 6GHz band, which is not exclusive to Wi-Fi 7 (a variant of Wi-Fi 6 known as Wi-Fi 6E also supports it), but is required to take advantage of 320MHz channel width. Nearly every router and mesh system PCMag has tested so far has shown far more limited range at 6GHz than at 2.4GHz or 5GHz. That could change once the US Federal Communications Commission approves a feature known as Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC). Until then, many devices will transmit and receive at lower power on the 6GHz channel, negating much of the benefit unless you\u2019re in very close proximity to the router\u2014essentially in the same room.\nAbout Tom Brant\nI\u2019m the deputy managing editor of the hardware team at PCMag.com.

        "raw_content": "UPDATED 16:29 EST / JANUARY 08 2024\nAlliance begins certifying devices that support the Wi-Fi 7 wireless standard\nby\nMaria Deutscher\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance has begun certifying devices that support Wi-Fi 7, the latest iteration of the ubiquitous wireless networking standard.\nThe group announced the move today at the CES 2024 consumer electronics event in Las Vegas. The launch of the certification program marks a notable milestone in the industry\u2019s rollout of Wi-Fi 7, which promises to significantly speed up wireless connections. The technology will become available on handsets, personal computers, routers and a range of other devices.\n\u201cThe introduction of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7 marks the emergence of the latest generation of Wi-Fi and will be an accelerant to mass adoption of Wi-Fi 7,\u201d said Wi-Fi Alliance Chief Executive Officer Kevin Robinson.\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance is an industry consortium backed by major chipmakers and dozens of other tech companies. One of its responsibilities is helping wireless device makers ensure that their products provide reliable connectivity. If a device implements the Wi-Fi standard correctly, it can become eligible for a certificate from the Wi-Fi Alliance.\nWi-Fi 7, the latest version of the networking standard, promises to enhance wireless connections significantly. The technology\u2019s previous iteration allowed devices to transmit data at a rate of up to 10 gigabits per second. Wi-Fi 7 quadruples the maximum supported throughput to 40 gigabits per second and also promises to reduce latency.\nOne of the main contributors to Wi-Fi 7\u2019s performance is a feature called MLO, or multilink operations. It allows wireless devices to more efficiently use the sections of the radio spectrum at their disposal.\nA given radio frequency or set of frequencies over which a Wi-Fi device transmits data is known as a channel. The more channels a device supports, the more bandwidth it provides. For example, a router that transmits data over three frequencies can theoretically provide three times as much bandwidth as a single-frequency device. That translates into faster download speeds for users.\nThe MLO feature in Wi-Fi 7 allows devices to spread a wireless connection across more frequency sets, or channels, than was possible before and thereby speed up downloads. Moreover, the technology makes network links more reliable in the process. If one of the frequencies a device uses to power a wireless connection experiences interference, data can still be sent over the remaining frequencies.\nWi-Fi 7 also introduces other improvements. One of the most significant upgrades was made to the standard\u2019s modulation algorithm, which it uses to encode data into radio waves. Wi-Fi 7 features a new modulation algorithm called 4K QAM that is capable of processing data 20% faster than the previous software.\nTo date, a half-dozen hardware makers have signed up to receive Wi-Fi 7 certifications from the Wi-Fi Alliance. The group includes Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc., Ruckus Networks Inc., MediaTek Inc. and MaxLinear, Inc. Though the Wi-Fi Alliance formally launched its certification program today, several of the initial participants have already introduced products that feature Wi-Fi 7 support.\nThe consortium estimates that 233 million devices with Wi-Fi 7 compatibility will ship this year. By 2028, that number is expected to grow nearly tenfold to 2.1 billion.\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\nTHANK YOU\nReport: HPE closing on $13B deal to buy Juniper Networks\nTwilio co-founder and CEO Jeff Lawson bows to pressure from activist investors to step down\nChertoff Group affiliate MC\u00b2 Security Fund acquires cybersecurity company Trustwave\nOpenAI argues New York Times\u2019 AI copyright lawsuit is \u2018without merit\u2019\nAlliance begins certifying devices that support the Wi-Fi 7 wireless standard\nAMD debuts new desktop APUs, GPU at CES 2024\nReport: HPE closing on $13B deal to buy Juniper Networks\nINFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 1 MIN AGO\nTwilio co-founder and CEO Jeff Lawson bows to pressure from activist investors to step down\nCLOUD - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 47 MINS AGO\nChertoff Group affiliate MC\u00b2 Security Fund acquires cybersecurity company Trustwave\nSECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 56 MINS AGO\nOpenAI argues New York Times\u2019 AI copyright lawsuit is \u2018without merit\u2019\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 2 HOURS AGO\nAlliance begins certifying devices that support the Wi-Fi 7 wireless standard\nEMERGING TECH - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 3 HOURS AGO\nAMD debuts new desktop APUs, GPU at CES 2024\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 5 HOURS AGO\nSend us a News Tip\nForgot Password?\nEXTRACT THE SIGNAL FROM THE NOISE\nLike Free Content?

The Wi-Fi Alliance industry group has confirmed today that the standard is locked in, and it has started certifying devices that will support Wi-Fi 7.\nToday's press release from the Wi-Fi Alliance claims that over 233 million devices will get the Wi-Fi 7 certification approval by the end of 2024. Of course, some Wi-Fi router companies like Amazon's Eero, NETGEAR, and others started selling Wi-Fi 7 products without official certification several months ago. If you see the Wi-Fi 7 Certified logo on a product, that's confirmation that it has passed the requirements of the standard from the Wi-Fi Alliance.\nThe press release added:\nNew use cases \u2013 including multi-user AR/VR/XR, immersive 3-D training, electronic gaming, hybrid work, industrial IoT, and automotive \u2013 will advance as a result of the latest Wi-Fi generation. Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 7 represents the culmination of extensive collaboration and innovation within Wi-Fi Alliance, facilitating worldwide product interoperability and a robust, sophisticated device ecosystem.\nThe biggest new feature in Wi-Fi 7 devices is what's called Multi-link Operation or MLO. This allows those devices to download or upload data using two or more linked wireless bands. This is supposed to offer \"increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved reliability\" for Wi-Fi 7 connections, according to the Wi-Fi Alliance.\nOther features include support for 320 MHz channels (6 GHz band), which is double the highest 160MHz bandwidth available on older Wi-Fi devices, Speaking of which, Wi-Fi 7 products are backward compatible with other devices that use the older Wi-Fi standards. You won't get the fastest speeds with those connections, but they will still work.\nYou can expect to see Wi-Fi 7 hardware inside a ton of new laptop PCs, along with smartphones, tablets, and VR/AR headsets over the next year. The Wi-Fi Alliance claims that 233 million Wi-Fi 7-based devices will be available by the end of 2024. That number is expected to expand to 2.1 billion devices by 2028.\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAMD Ryzen 8000G DDR5 desktop APU is ready for the nex-gen AI-powered Windows\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro launches in the US on February 2, 2024\nRelated Stories\nAcer joins hands with Qualcomm to bring new Predator Connect Wi-Fi 7 gaming Routers\nFiza Ali\n\u00b7\nJan 7, 2024\nwith\n13\ncomment\ns\nNVIDIA reportedly is designing upcoming Arm-based CPUs for Windows PCs for launch in 2025\nJohn Callaham\n\u00b7\nOct 23, 2023\nwith\n43\ncomment\ns\nIntel releases its first Windows 11 driver for its new Wi-Fi 7 hardware\nJohn Callaham\n\u00b7\nOct 11, 2023\nwith\n7\ncomment\ns\nTSMC grapples with slowdown in demand as orders are reduced\nKarthik Mudaliar\n\u00b7\nDec 30, 2022\nwith\n9\ncomment\ns\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nCommunity Activity\nSoftware Stories\neM Client 9.2.2230\nBitdefender Antivirus Free 27.0.27.126 [Update]\nf.lux 4.131\nGoogle Earth Pro 7.3.6.9750\nTrending Stories\nMicrosoft releases new free Windows 11 virtual machines with the latest updates\nPrime members can get the Amazon Echo Show 8 for its lowest price ever with promo code [Update]\nYouTube appears to be slowing itself down upon detecting ad blockers [Update]\nJoin the conversation!\nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\n6 Comments - Add comment\nReport Comment\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\nWindows 10 gets new features (again), Patch Tuesday updates, and more!\nmicrosoft weekly\nWindows 11 build 23619 adds a new way to get mobile images on your PC\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\nThe Geekom Mini Air12 review: could this be your next Cloud PC?\nmini air12\nSpaceX to launch private Axiom 3 mission to ISS\ntwirl 147\nEvery Windows 10 and 11 feature Microsoft deprecated in 2023\nwindows\nWindows 11 build 22635.3061 has improved Windows Share\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\nWindows 11 build 26020 adds new energy saver icon and more\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\nWindows 11 23H2 benchmarked vs 22H2\nwin 11 22h2 vs 23h2 clean\nAvatar: Frontiers of Pandora review: A gorgeous but generic experience\navatar frontiers of pandora\nHere is everything new in Windows 11 23H2, the current big feature update\nwindows 11 23h2\nHere is a simple method to uninstall Edge in Windows 10 and 11\nedge\nHow to disable news in Windows Widgets in Windows 11\nwindows widgets\nHow to install Windows 11 version 23H2 on unsupported hardware\nwindows 11 23h2 guide\nCompany\nCommunity\nSocial\nPartners\n\u00a9 Since 2000 Neowin LLC.\nAll trademarks mentioned are the property of their respective owners.\nLogin"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024\nThe devices and gadgets that impressed us at CES 2024.\nWe're only a couple of weeks into 2024, but the year is starting off strong with the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Plenty of companies were there, showing off their latest devices, innovations, and concepts, from big companies like Google, LG, Samsung, and ASUS, to new and smaller companies you may not have heard of (but will probably hear more about throughout the year).\nYet, while there's plenty that happened at the CES 2024, we wanted to highlight some of the products that really stuck out to Android Central, from phones to wearables, TVs, mixed reality devices, and even some concepts that may or may not see the light of day.\nASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro\nCES isn't known to have plenty of major phone launches, but that didn't stop ASUS from giving us what might be one of the best gaming phones of the year. We went hands-on with the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro, and it seems nearly perfect. It has a clean design, particularly for a gaming phone, a powerful new Snapdragon chipset, up to 24GB of RAM, and a snappy 165Hz OLED display. And while gaming phones aren't known for having the best cameras, the 50MP primary camera on the ROG Phone 8 Pro is already proving to be quite an improvement over previous iterations.\nIf you like RGB lighting, you'll want the non-Pro version, but the Pro has a new dot matrix panel dubbed AniMe Vision that supports various animations for notifications, charge level, incoming calls, and more user-customizable options.\nThe ROG Phone 8 Pro is available for $1,199, while its base Phone 8 sibling can be grabbed for $1,099.\nSamsung In&Out Flip\nCompanies love to show off upcoming products at CES, but they also like to tease us with concepts that may never actually go on sale. Samsung had quite a spectacle at CES with its TVs, but the company also gave us a glimpse at some impressive display tech, namely the In&Out Flip. It's an evolution of the Galaxy Z Flip line that not only folds in like a regular flip phone but also flips outward. That's why there's only one display and no cover screen; you can just flip the phone outward when you just want to use part of the display or use both on the front and back.\nBecause the In&Out Flip only uses a single flexible display, Samsung says the phone achieves a \"sleeker and thinner design,\" which is a goal for foldable phones, as they only get thicker when you fold them in half.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem like we'll get this on a commercial phone any time soon, but it's cool to look at, and we can only hope.\nEvie Ring\nSmart rings are slowly but surely becoming a thing as more companies launch their own takes. The Oura Ring has pretty much led the smart ring charge, but the Evie Ring is one of the latest challengers to enter... the ring. What's interesting about this device is the rather unique design and the fact that the Evie Ring is geared toward women with features like period tracking and mood logging. And thanks to the companion app, there's AI that will learn more about you to provide helpful insights about your health.\nBattery life comes short compared to other devices like the Oura Ring, clocking in at four or more days. However, the charging case tops up the device in just 60 minutes, and you can take it anywhere with you. And the best part is that there's no subscription to take advantage of your features.\nMovano first debuted the Evie Ring back in 2022, so it's taken some time for the company to bring it to market. However, it's finally available to buy for just $269 if you're an iOS user, with Android support coming later this year.\nXREAL Air 2 Ultra\nSmart glasses are another growing piece of tech, with various companies trying to grab their piece of the pie. XREAL is no stranger to the game, having launched a few models already, and the latest pair has its sights squarely on Meta and Apple. The Air 2 Ultra features a lightweight design that is not much larger than a regular pair of sunglasses. Of course, these do much more, thanks to its affordable take on mixed reality.\nIt comes with two Sony Micro-LED panels with 1080p resolution per eye and up to 120Hz refresh rate, a wider 52-degree field of view, and 6 DoF tracking enabled by the two front-facing 3D sensors so you can move around and interact with virtual objects within your space.\nWhere they differ from the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest Pro is that these glasses need to be plugged into an external device to work, such as a Galaxy S23 or a PC. However, these are also much cheaper than its competitors at just $700, which is one way to get mixed reality devices into the hands of more consumers.\nRabbit R1\nThis is an interesting one. The Rabbit R1 looks like the weirdest phone, although it's not exactly a phone in the traditional sense. It's a physical AI assistant that almost tries to replace your phone by learning how to use the apps you use and perform the functions that would normally require you to navigate settings and apps. Thanks to the large action model powering it and help from ChatGPT-4, the Rabbit R1 can learn how you do these things, and with the press of a button, you can tell it to do things from starting a Spotify playlist to shopping online.\nThe display will present you with cards related to your query, and the device doesn't run a traditional operating system, so you won't find apps here. That said, the Rabbit R1 can connect to your apps to learn how you use them. There's also a camera you can use for image-based queries.\nWith the rise in AI tech over the past year, it's no surprise companies are looking to create ways to create dedicated devices to tap into it. And while it's not immediately clear how helpful a device like this really is in practical use, the Rabbit R1 has already sold 10,000 units on its first day, and the device is expected to ship in Q2 2024.\nLG Signature OLED T\nLG made some big announcements at CES, including the fact that its new TVs will now have Google Cast built-in. But one particular TV really stands out from the pack, and it's the new Signature OLED T. It's not LG's first transparent OLED display, but it's the first meant for consumers, and it works almost completely wireless thanks to the Zero Connect Box that beams your content directly to the television.\nWhen the TV is in transparency mode, it can give certain content a level of depth that you don't get with a conventional TV. Then, when you want that conventional viewing experience, you can bring back the black contrast screen so it looks like a regular OLED. And when the TV's not in use, it has an AOD function that can make the display look like a fish tank, while a small bar at the bottom uses the contrast film to display news alerts, weather, and other bits of information.\nIt may sound a bit gimmicky, but there's no denying that it's a cool piece of tech, and the 77-inch 4K TV will go on sale for an unspecified price sometime this year.\nAnker MagGo Charging Station (Orb)\nWith Qi2 on the rise, more companies are beginning to launch products that support the standard. Anker is among the first, having shown off a few new charging products at CES. One of them is a large orb that charges MagSafe-compatible phones on the front, with plenty of ports to charge other devices on the back. It's an 8-in-1 charging station that includes three AC outlets, two USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports, making it perfect for any workspace.\nThe Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station is available now for $99, but iPhone users are the only ones who can take full advantage of the MagSafe charger, at least until we start seeing Android phones with Qi2 support.\nXGIMI Aladdin\nWho needs a TV in your room when you can just have a ceiling lamp? Yeah, I said that right; this ceiling lamp is also a projector. The XGIMI Aladdin is capable of projecting a 100-inch 4K image with a 2000:1 contrast ratio and support for DTS audio. It's all tucked away inconspicuously into your ceiling. It's also powered by Android TV, so you'll have access to plenty of apps and content.\nAnd when you don't need it as a TV, the projector also works as a standalone Bluetooth speaker, meaning it can help you get the party started.\nWithings BeamO\nWithings is one of our favorite health companies, making some of the best smart scales on the market. Now, the company has a new device dubbed \"BeamO\" that acts as a personal DIY health checkup device. It's a 4-in-1 \"multiscope\" that includes a thermometer, electrocardiogram (ECG), oximeter, and stethoscope, allowing users to monitor their health at home in a way that would probably normally require a doctor's visit. The device has powerful sensors and a display that can show your data in real-time as it's being measured. All the data syncs to the Withings app, which can then be sent to your doctor, and like other Withings devices, BeamO supports up to eight different users, so it's perfect for families.\nYou'll have to wait some time to get your hands on this CES Innovations Award Honoree, as it will go on sale in June 2024 for $249.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nOne device that took us by surprise is the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a 2-in-1 Windows laptop that doubles as an Android tablet with the press of a button. As such, you actually have two separate sets of specs and processors to run each OS: a new Intel Core Ultra 7 for Windows and a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 for Android.\nAs an Android tablet, it runs Android 13 and has 12GB of RAM, which isn't too shabby. As a Windows laptop, you get 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage (versus 256GB for the Android side), an additional USB-C port, and a larger battery. Both share the 14-inch 2.8K OLED panel.\nYou get two devices in one for $1999, which would normally be a lot for a single device. When you're getting both in one, the price seems pretty reasonable. And while some may have preferred a ChromeOS/Android hybrid, the Windows/Android duo sounds like a winning combination. You get the fun bits from Android, such as the extensive library of apps, and you can also use it as a productivity device when used as a Windows laptop \u2014 something Android tablets always seem to aim for but always fall short of achieving.\nLenovo says the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid will be available in Q2 2024.\nBe an expert in 5 minutes\nGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android\nDerrek is a long-time Nokia and LG fanboy who loves astronomy, videography, and sci-fi movies.

We've rounded up the nine hi-fi and audio stories that you need to know about right here.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nSonus Faber delivered the wow factor with its new Suprema system, an impressive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 loudspeaker system that\u2019ll set you back \u00a3695,000 / $750,000 for its set up of two speakers, two subwoofers, and one electronic crossover.\nThe company has described the Suprema as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d but the design of the Suprema system remains very much \u2018Sonus Faber\u2019 in its styling.\nThe speakers are 4/5-way designs with eight front-firing speakers in addition to two back-firing drivers, while the subwoofer system uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz.\nAs for the external electronic crossover, it is a dual mono and fully balanced design, with all phase cutting and control circuits purely analogue.\nThe range is available in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes. What isn\u2019t included is a house large enough to keep it in.\nREAD MORE: Sonus Faber marks 40 years with stunning Suprema speaker system, its \u201cmost ambitious project ever\u201d\nFocal Aria Evo X\nA slightly more accessible speaker line up came from Focal, in the shape of its Aria Evo X \u2014 successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nWith speakers covering both traditional stereo and surround sound setups, the range consists of five new models, including the No.1 standmount speakers, the No.2, No.3 and No.4 floorstanders and the Evo X centre speaker.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nYou can pick up this new range now in a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish.\nREAD MORE: Focal's Aria Evo X speaker range could be the stylish home cinema solution you've been searching for\nFiiO R9\nFiiO launched three brand-new products at CES 2024 in Las Vegas (including the CP-13 cassette player \u2014 yes, you read that right), but it was the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC that most caught our eye.\nIt represents an all-round upgrade over last year\u2019s R7, with a larger 6-inch Full HD touchscreen, upgraded components and more than double the power \u2014 now 7300mW, up from 3000mW.\nYou can enjoy 64GB onboard storage and a range of connections, including a new HDMI ARC port alongside the SD, USB, optical, coaxial and ethernet inputs found previously. Headphone users are well catered for too, with a choice of single-ended 6.35mm, balanced 4.4mm, and balanced 4-pin XLR outputs available.\nFrom a wireless perspective, there's Bluetooth 5.0 and 2.4GHz / 5GHz wi-fi capabilities, with support for high-resolution PCM files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512 audio, and MQA decoding. It also supports AirPlay ad DLNA streaming, and is Roon Ready \u2014 plus as it runs on Android you can directly install streaming services like Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify and Qobuz.\nYou can pick it up from mid-January and will cost \u00a31399 / $1499.\nREAD MORE: FiiO\u2019s tech-laden R9 streamer could be the solution to your desktop audio needs\nSennheiser Momentum Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled a trio of new products at CES 2024, but it's the Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds that we're most excited about.\nThe current\u00a0Momentum True Wireless 3\u00a0picked up five stars in our review, but they are coming up to two years old now, and that's starting to show against newer competition.\nPromising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the enhancements you'll find this time round include improved ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and Auracast support \u2014 a new Bluetooth feature that opens up the world of audio sharing between various compatible devices and sources.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThey'll be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nREAD MORE: Sennheiser's triple drop includes a much-anticipated sequel to the Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro added a new flagship speaker to its What Hi-Fi? Award-winning C Series at CES 2024, created with both music and TV sound in mind.\nAll wrapped up in the brand\u2019s signature Scandinavian design, the C20 packs all manner of inputs to make the most of that versatility, including a dedicated line-in, a built-in MM phono stage, and an ARC optical input for your TV.\nThe C20 can also stream music wirelessly up to 24-bit/96kHz via your choice of Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth.\nThere's 190W of power here, plus you can stereo pair a couple of C20s together using the Audio Pro app, or Apple AirPlay 2. There's even a sub-out for more low-end oomph if you need it.\nThe C20 will be available in a choice of soft satin white, stylish grey or classic black from February, and will be priced at \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550.\nREAD MORE: The Audio Pro C20 is an all-in-one speaker solution for your music and movies\nMcIntosh MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier\nAs part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, McIntosh used CES 2024 to announce one of its most powerful amplifiers to date.\nThe new MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier builds on the legacy of 2005's MC2KW, with a tri-chassis construction and 2000 watts of power to give what McIntosh promises will be \"a new industry standard for power and amplification\".\nSome of its improvements include a large-capacity power supply for better performance of low-end frequencies and improved dynamic headroom, while four bespoke McIntosh heatsinks on each power module ensure efficient heat dissipation for more consistent audio quality.\nFurther enhanced circuit designs with upgraded components and shorter signal paths should also aid sonic performance, as should the MC2.1KW's updated electrical wiring and interconnect cables.\nThe MC2.1KW will be available from January 2024 at authorised dealers for an eye-watering \u00a359,995 / \u20ac64,990 / $50,000.\nREAD MORE: McIntosh's 75th-anniversary monoblock amp aims to set a new industry standard for power\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire was one of four turntables unveiled by the brand at CES 2024, but this one caught our eye for its ability to wirelessly stream gorgeous vinyl sound all around your house.\nIt follows in the footsteps of last year's\u00a0Stream Carbon, which worked with Sonos to do just that. However, the Sapphire adds to this with UPnP and\u00a0Roon\u00a0support too, enabling playback through a whole load more compatible devices, all without the need for any further equipment.\nOf course, there are also gold-plated RCA outputs for traditional wired systems and powered speakers too. Expect it to cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nREAD MORE: The Victrola Stream Sapphire turntable can stream vinyl sound all round your house\nJBL Xtreme 4\nJBL announced the latest iteration of its rugged Bluetooth speaker, the Xtreme 4 \u2014 and this time round, it\u2019s leaning on AI to get the very best sound quality from it.\nThe AI Sound Boost feature sees an AI algorithm analysing your music in real time to optimise what you hear, resulting in a more powerful and less distorted sound.\nThe Xtreme 4 is also one of the first JBL wireless speakers to support\u00a0Auracast.\nIt retains its rugged capabilities, with an IP67 rating, plus a 24-hour battery life, with the ability to use it as a charger for your phone if you\u2019re caught short. You can even replace the battery further down the line if you need to.\nIt\u2019ll cost \u00a3330 / $380 / \u20ac350 when it goes on sale in March.\nREAD MORE: JBL\u2019s Xtreme 4 wireless speaker uses AI to boost sound quality\nRoon Nucleus Titan\nMark this in the \u201cserious hi-fi purchase\u201d column, but Roon used CES 2024 to announce a new flagship server, called the Nucleus Titan.\nLike Roon's previous flagship, the Nucleus Plus, the new Nucleus Titan is a dedicated server/streamer solution that has been optimised to work with Roon's OS to deliver \"bit-perfect playback\" of your hi-res digital music collection to a Roon-compatible hi-fi system.\nWhere the new top-tier server surpasses its predecessor is in performance quality and a self-cooling design with \"silent, fan-less operation\".\nThe Titan also sports two USB-C and two USB-A inputs, along with two audio-only HDMI ports. Its internal storage comes in three sizes: 2TB, 4TB and 8TB. Multiroom audio setups are also supported.\nCosting $3699 before adding storage (and your Roon subscription), this is a something of luxury purchase, to say the least. But if you\u2019re serious about Roon, this is undoubtedly the ultimate partner to the Roon software platform.\nREAD MORE: Roon's Nucleus Titan is the ambitious server of audiophiles' dreams \u2013 and has the price to match\nCheck out all the CES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, hands-on reviews and more\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

But we did notice some genuinely exciting things this year, including the one item almost all of us were talking about: a TV that becomes completely see-through.\nHere\u2019s more about that, and a baker\u2019s dozen other things that we\u2019re looking forward to in 2024:\nA TV you look through\nLG Transparent OLED (LG OLED T, LG OLED Signature T), later this year, price TBD\nLG\u2019s wireless, transparent OLED TV is a fantastical concept that few people will buy\u2014but everyone will want.\nUsing proprietary wireless video technology and some kind of pixel magic that LG didn\u2019t fully explain, the 77-inch 4K transparent OLED TV creates images that seem to float in space.\nFish appear to be swimming in midair. Snow appears to materialize in your living room. When turned off, the TV basically disappears.\nIt also has a rolling contrast screen that can slide up behind it to turn it into a traditional OLED TV.\nIt has no bezel, no wires, nowhere to plug anything in, and\u2014somehow\u2014no discernible heat signature (I reached behind the transparent display, and it was surprisingly cool).\nWhile there is a roughly 1-inch-thick screen suspended in the TV\u2019s housing frame, you can see right through to the wall behind it, though the glass still has a slight sepia tone. The transparent display creates a kind of faux 3D effect while you\u2019re watching, such that the images appear to occupy the full space between the wall at the rear and the front of the screen.\nThough AV fans may argue that the effect dispels traditional cinematic immersion, it\u2019s still an undeniably captivating spin on the usual TV-watching experience.\nLG has stated that the LG OLED T will be available to buy later this year, and though we\u2019ll love to see it show up in department stores and hotel lobbies, it\u2019s not likely to be priced for the average buyer\u2014unless you have tens of thousands to spare for a nearly invisible TV.\nA more comfortable heart-rate monitor\nGarmin HRM-Fit, available now, $150\nGarmin unveiled the HRM-Fit, which attempts to eliminate some of the long-standing discomfort associated with wearing a heart-rate monitor.\nIn the demos we saw, the HRM-Fit clipped to a sports bra, negating the need to wear a band across the entire chest, which we\u2019ve noticed sometimes leads to chafing or irritation with other monitors.\nAside from heart rate, the monitor also tracks steps and calories burned, as well as feedback on your running strides (through the Garmin Connect app). Garmin advertises the HRM-Fit as having a one-year battery life.\nA smart gadget for good boys\nPawport, May 2024, from $450\nThe smart home was ubiquitous at CES, with internet-connected models of nearly any device imaginable on display.\nTopping my list of favorites was the Pawport, a smart pet door that opens and closes automatically when your pet approaches.\nWhat is so appealing to me (note, I don\u2019t even have a pet and am still unreasonably thrilled by this thing) is how thoughtfully the software and hardware were designed. The result is the essence of what makes a \u201csmart\u201d device desirable.\nThe Pawport consists of a pair of powered aluminum doors connected by steel hinges to a steel frame. You screw the frame around an existing pet door and then slide the Pawport down over the frame.\nAround the inside of the doors is rubber weatherstripping that compresses when the doors close to form an airtight seal. The doors are either insulated or have rechargeable, slide-in batteries that last several months between charges.\nOn top is a suite of intuitive touch controls, including open, close, lock, and power.\nThe companion to the doors is a collar fob with a rechargeable battery that sends a Bluetooth signal to the Pawport so that it opens when the pet approaches from inside or outside. It\u2019s also smart enough not to open the door if your pup decides to lie down within range of the door.\nThe Pawport is due in May and will be sold in a range of sizes and finishes\u2014that\u2019s plenty of time for me to convince my wife that a dog is the thing our family is really missing.\nSecurity over the longer range\nAbode Edge Camera, later this year, $200\nOutdoor security cameras should help give you peace of mind, but if Wi-Fi connection issues plague your outdoor cameras, you\u2019ll find no peace.\nAbode\u2019s new answer to that problem\u2014the Abode Edge Camera\u2014replaces traditional Wi-Fi with HaLow wireless technology, which gives it a range of almost 1.5 miles.\nIn addition to long range, HaLow is good at penetrating structures, making this camera suitable for outdoor use while the unit\u2019s wireless hub, which connects to your main network, sits safely indoors.\nThe weatherproof camera includes a 6,000 mAh rechargeable battery, which the company says will power the camera for up to a year.\nThe camera can integrate with Abode\u2019s security systems, including the one we reviewed.\nOther security camera companies have tackled the long-distance Wi-Fi problem by skipping it altogether and including 4G LTE connections in their cameras, but those models require an expensive subscription fee through carriers such as T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAbode\u2019s Edge camera is expected to sell for $200 and requires just a $4-per-month service plan for cloud video storage.\nSimple, (almost) instant smoking\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, available now, $1,000\nAt CES I saw more grills, smokers, and meat thermometers than in my local Home Depot, but the standout was the countertop GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker.\nSmoking adds distinct flavor to all kinds of foods, but it\u2019s typically done over lower temperatures for long hours, requiring the cook to camp out in the backyard by a hot black metal bin to feed the fire and actively manage the smoke and the temperature. To do it well, in other words, you need passion, time, and skill.\nIf the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works as billed\u2014the company says you can set it to specific recipes and let it do the work, or you can independently control the heat or smoke level\u2014it can effectively turn smoking into a readily accessible cooking technique for anyone who wants it, just like air frying or sous vide. Imagine popping a few eggplants into a microwave-sized appliance to make killer homemade baba ghanouj on a weeknight, or smoking your own spice blends or chiles whenever the mood strikes.\nI got a sneak peek at this cooker late last year on a research trip to the GE Appliances manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where I got to sample some perfectly prepared wings hot out of the box\u2014tender, smoky, sweet, and moist.\nA few more important details: The smoker uses the same pellets as traditional pellet smokers do. It fits 40 wings, a brisket cut in half, or a whole chicken, and it has the same technology to keep the smoke safely inside the appliance and out of your home as the hearth oven made by Monogram, GE Appliances\u2019s luxury brand.\nA simple pocket drone for action selfies\nHoverAir X1, available now, from $350\nDJI has had a death grip on the hobby drone market for the past few years, and for good reason. The image quality, control systems, and autonomous flight modes on the brand\u2019s drones have excelled in our testing, and DJI\u2019s lineup satisfies almost every budget and need.\nThat\u2019s why I was excited to find a tiny, cheap, and potentially uniquely usable drone made by a different company at this year\u2019s CES.\nThe HoverAir X1 is a 4.4-ounce, foldable drone that aims to enable people to capture quick and easy close-up footage. It lacks a dedicated controller, instead focusing on autonomous flight modes and subject-tracking software to follow activities.\nWe\u2019ll be testing this drone against our picks to see if this $350 model ($400 with two extra batteries) can compete with the much more expensive and versatile DJI Mini Pro series. While we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll replace the more expensive cinematic drones, it may be a useful and relatively affordable tool for folks looking to capture simple follow-along footage.\nWash and dry in one laundry machine\nGE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer, available now, $2,900\nIn the future, will a combo washer/dryer actually dry your clothes?\nCombo washer/dryers were plentiful at CES this year, and we found the GE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer to be the most intriguing.\nTwo-in-one laundry machines aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re generally less popular. These machines are heat-pump dryers, which use a closed-loop heat system (no vents) to dry clothes at a lower temperature. In practice that has made them less effective at drying clothes.\nDeveloping the UltraFast Combo required years of GE research into heat-pump dryers, which has resulted in patented technology meant to boost the drying process. If this new approach substantially improves drying performance, it could be the beginning of a major change for laundry appliances.\nA ventless machine that requires less space and less time to operate could transform how people do laundry. Even better: Heat-pump dryers use substantially less energy than traditional dryers, and these home appliances qualify for home energy rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ll be testing this combo washer/dryer, along with several others, later in the year.\nIn-ear translation and out-of-ear sound\nVasco Translator E1, June 2024, $390\nVasco has put its impressive handheld live translator into an earbud format. The Vasco Translator E1 earpiece translates nearly 50 languages in real time (though it still needs to be connected to an app on your phone).\nAnd if the final product works like the demo, its performance will be impressive.\nVasco spent a lot of time working with linguists to address idioms and variations in meaning that direct word-for-word translations don\u2019t consider, which can be crucial to understanding someone in business settings, at medical appointments, or when you\u2019re speaking with local police. The translated text is visible in the app and spoken through the earpiece.\nMagSafe-like wireless charging for Android phones\nBaseus Qi2 Magpro Magnetic Wireless Charging Car Mount, early 2024, price TBD\nBig advancements in charging technology are rare, but a new development in this sphere was hard to miss at this year\u2019s CES: Qi2 (pronounced \u201cchee two\u201d) wireless charging.\nLike Apple\u2019s MagSafe, Qi2 uses rings of magnets to ensure easy alignment between phone and charger, and it allows any compatible device to charge at up to 15 W\u2014twice as fast as the original Qi spec could deliver. Even better, it isn\u2019t proprietary to Apple, so any device that rolls out with a Qi2 certification going forward (maybe the next Pixel?) will be able to take advantage of its faster charging speeds and sturdy magnetic connection.\nOf all the Qi2 chargers we saw on the showroom floor this week\u2014and there were many, from well-known brands like Anker, ESR, and Hyper\u2014we\u2019re most excited about a wireless-charging car mount from Baseus (set to launch in early 2024). Not only does it support Qi2\u2019s 15 W charging speeds, but it also has a small built-in fan to help your phone stay cool. This is handy since wireless chargers in general are prone to overheating, which can damage your device\u2019s battery over time.\nTurntable music that doesn\u2019t have to stop\nVictrola Automatic Turntable, later this year, $200\nWhile some vinyl enthusiasts want turntables that let them tweak every aspect, others, especially those new to the hobby, want something that doesn\u2019t require so much homework\u2014or money.\nThe Victrola Automatic is the latter kind.\nAs a fully automatic turntable, it lowers the tonearm to begin play and raises it at the end. Just place your record down and hit the play button. Victrola also introduced a repeat mode that automatically moves the stylus back to the beginning of the record and plays it again (and again), a useful feature if you\u2019re spinning a favorite.\nThe Victrola Automatic can connect to wired or wireless speakers and includes RCA outputs with a switchable preamp, plus Bluetooth to stream to a pair of wireless speakers, such as the Edifier S1000MKII, our pick for the best powered speakers with Bluetooth.\nComputer monitors go OLED\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM Monitor, later this year, price TBD\nPC monitors are getting bigger, brighter, and equipped with far more contrast than ever before.\nNearly every PC vendor announced a new 4K OLED monitor at CES, so we expect a lot of competition for our best 4K monitor guide this year.\nMost LCD monitors you\u2019ve seen have a backlight that shines through the TV\u2019s picture, illuminating it to be visible. In OLED technology, each one of the screen\u2019s pixels illuminates itself and can individually turn on or turn off for the most pure black tones.\nFor gamers, this year\u2019s OLED displays are especially eye-catching. The LG UltraGear 32GS95UE, for instance, can switch what\u2019s on the display at 240 Hz, or 240 times per second. That higher refresh rate makes animations and motion on the screen seem more crisp and real. And the 32GS95UE can even boost the refresh rate to a staggering 480 Hz, if it knocks its 4K resolution down to 1080p. For everybody else, OLEDs offer fantastic color accuracy and nearly infinite contrast.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for that LG monitor, as well as Asus\u2019s ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which supports the DolbyVision HDR format.\nAI comes to your laptop\nVarious laptops from many brands, later this year, prices vary\nMicrosoft has dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of the AI PC.\u201d\nThe addition of the flashy new Copilot shortcut key allows even quicker access to your PC\u2019s AI capabilities. It also marks the first major change to the Windows keyboard in nearly three decades.\nBut the more significant change is under the hood. This year\u2019s newest PCs with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors have NPUs, or neural processing units, that run machine-learning processes locally. As a result, these tasks can run faster, can use less battery life, and can be more secure than sending them off to the cloud.\nSome notable examples of laptops with these processors include new versions of our top ultrabook picks that are available now\u2014the HP Spectre x360 14, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405), and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12\u2014as well as a fleet of other premium laptops shipping in the coming months.\nRight now, AI PC features are limited\u2014the prime example is Windows Studio effects, which use AI for video-conferencing features such as background blur and noise cancellation. But now that NPUs are available in a big way from Intel and AMD, many laptop and software companies are building apps and features that take advantage of them.\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to use a conversational interface for navigating and changing settings on your PC without having to dig through labyrinthine menus, or ask for a summary of a meeting transcript. We expect to see these AI PC features evolve over the coming years.\nPC gaming handhelds are here to stay, and Intel is getting involved\nMSI Claw A1M, later this year, price TBD\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since Valve and AMD brought handheld PC gaming to the masses with the Linux-based Steam Deck, and 2023 saw Asus and Lenovo join in with the Windows-based ROG Ally Extreme and Legion Go, respectively.\nBut MSI\u2019s new partnership with Intel for its upcoming Claw gaming handheld\u2014announced at CES and featuring a Meteor Lake\u2013based system-on-a-chip\u2014is the clearest indication yet that the major players in PC gaming are taking these devices more seriously than ever.\nMSI\u2019s Claw borrows heavily from the ROG Ally Extreme. It has a similar form, down to the programmable buttons on the back of each side grip and the function buttons on either side of its 1080p, variable-refresh-rate display. But the differences are obvious as well.\nThe rear of the Claw features a heavily vented design that MSI claims will help with heat dissipation, and MSI has stressed that the included 53 Wh battery should give two hours of battery life on its maximum performance settings, beating out the ROG Ally Extreme and even Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go.\nMSI will still have its work cut out for it against bigger players, and we have good reason to wonder how Intel\u2019s new hardware will fare compared with AMD\u2019s more mature graphics tech. We don\u2019t know how much effective battery life the Claw will have in real-world scenarios, or how easily it will manage different power profiles.\nAt CES, MSI was using October\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage to demonstrate the Claw\u2019s capabilities, but it wasn\u2019t running especially well, and the system-management software was sluggish and poorly organized.\nThe Claw is likely a couple of months away still, and every one of these mainstream gaming handhelds has launched in rough shape\u2014it was months before the ROG Ally Extreme felt stable, the Legion Go is still a work in progress, and the recent Steam Deck OLED model has seen dozens of beta updates since its November launch. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Claw comes together in February or March.\nRegardless, Intel\u2019s entry into the market is a clear indication that it thinks the demand for this kind of device is only going to grow, and after spending time with all of them, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nFaceTime calls made easy\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, later this year, $180\nBelkin\u2019s newest device is a motorized, auto-tracking iPhone dock that enables your phone camera to follow your face\u2014not only around the frame, but 360 degrees around. What this means: FaceTime calls and video recordings can follow you totally hands-free.\nBecause the dock uses Apple\u2019s DockKit API, you don\u2019t have to install an app to set it up. Pairing the dock with your iPhone takes seconds\u2014and the tracking is really good.\nOnce you place your iPhone on the dock\u2019s base, the Stand Pro instantly connects to it via NFC (near-field communication, the same technology that lets you make contactless mobile payments), and it uses Bluetooth to maintain its connection.\nYou can\u00a0activate or deactivate the tracking with the push of a single button, and the stand comes equipped with a screw port in case you want to attach it to a tripod, too. The Stand Pro also charges your iPhone via 15 W MagSafe charging, and the dock itself offers five-hour battery life when unplugged. We were impressed by the demo and can\u2019t wait to test the dock once it\u2019s available.\nThis article was edited by Jason Chen and Ben Frumin.\nMeet your guide\nWirecutter Staff\nFurther reading\nThe Best of CES 2022: What We\u2019re Most Looking Forward To\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter\u2019s expert staff found a few things to look forward to from CES 2022, including a smarter faucet and a projector that doubles as a portable speaker.\nThe Best Electric Vehicle Chargers for Home\nby Sarah Witman\nAfter 28 hours of research and 85 hours of testing, we found the best ways to charge your J1772 (non-Tesla) or Tesla electric vehicle at home.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking Forward To From CES 2019\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter reporters and editors spent three days working overtime at CES 2019 to find the new stuff that might actually improve your life this year.\nThe Best of CES 2023: What We\u2019re Looking Forward to Most\nby Wirecutter Staff\nA smarter water faucet, an excellent wireless speaker, and a cleaning genie were among our favorite things from CES 2023.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"
