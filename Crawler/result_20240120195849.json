        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Join us this week as we discuss what to expect at CES Asia. From Automotive to AI, 5G and more, we discuss all the exciting exhibitors, keynotes and conference sessions happening next week at CES Asia. Ritch Wood from Nu Skin will be joining us to share why the Asian market is especially relevant today for his company.\nJohn T. Kelly\nShow Director, CES Asia\nRitch Wood\nCEO, Nu Skin\nHey everybody. With the Consumer Technology Association, I'm Tyler Suiters, we are the owners, the producers, of CES, the largest, the most influential tech event on the planet. We are here to get your CES ready. Yes, already getting you CES ready. We know the big show is still a ways off, January 7th through the 10th 2020 in Las Vegas, but before then, the focus of today's podcast, CES Asia. This is June 11th through the 13th, this summer in Shanghai, China, with a distinct focus on the Asian marketplace. Yes there are a number of big name tech and auto companies that you'll recognize at Exhibit at CES and at CES Asia, but it is distinctly different in terms of the way the show is curated, the way these products and stories are presented, and the way these exhibitors and tech companies address the asian customer base. So all that is coming up today. First we'll have a conversation with the CES man on the ground there in Shanghai, John T. Kelly, who is the show director for CES Asia, and working feverishly, as you can imagine to get everything in place for June 11th.\nAlso backing up the story that every company today needs to be a tech company. Another entrant into the health, wellness, and beauty sector who is embracing technology. Remember last year, we had a long conversation with L'Oreal, who has exhibited at CES Las Vegas a number of times, about how technology is driving their business and changing it. Today we talked to beauty company Nu Skin. You may recognize their name, but what they're doing is not only unique to them, it's interesting in how they've used this technology to find a strong foothold in the Asian marketplace.\nAll of that is coming up on today's episode of CES Tech Talk.\nGraciously joining us from Shanghai, China right now, 12 hours opposite of where we sit in Washington, DC is John T. Kelly. He is the show director for CES Asia, and John, I'm not sure whether to say thanks for getting up so early, or thanks for staying up so late. I know you're outside office hours out there.\nThank you Tyler. Actually it is evening time here. So we've had another busy day. I'm preparing for the show. The show is approximately two weeks away, so it is crunch time here in Shanghai for our staff as they work to prepare for CES Asia.\nWell, let's talk about why it's such a crunch for you and the team John, and where is the show standing right now in terms of the people you're expecting, the number of tech companies that are going to be on hand exhibiting. Just the depth and breadth of what CES Asia is for 2019.\nWell Tyler, this is our fifth show. So we launched the show in 2015 and we've seen explodes of growth since then. In fact, total attendance is expected to grow nearly 75% since 2015 as we're expecting more than 50,000 attendees at the show this year. Additionally, our exhibit space has more than tripled since the inaugural show in 2015, and we're actually up 25% of growth over last year. So I think if you were to look at, you know ask, what is one word or one phrase to describe CES Asia? Over the course of the past year, I think it would be growth.\nThat might describe China overall as well. So for those folks who haven't been-\nVery good point.\nFor those who haven't been to China, John, I mean it's, you can study, you can look at the pictures, you can read articles and do your background, certainly, but it's a bit of an experience to be a metropolis like Shanghai or Beijing or take your pick of major cities in China. I mean, what is the scene like there on show days, because there's always so much hustle and bustle, and just flat out people in these cities on a regular day, much mess a show day.\nRight, so the convention center we use actually had 17 halls and we occupy six of them, which our first year, five years ago, just to put some context here, we occupied one and a half halls, so again, going back to that growth that I just mentioned. During the show days it can be pretty crowded at the show. 50,000 people across six halls does get fairly crowded. A city of 24 million people here in Shanghai, everything is crowded. If you're on the subway, it's crowded, you walk down the streets, it's crowded, it's kind of hard to avoid crowds here, but we do a really good job of managing people and getting people where they need to be in the, which is on the show floor. There's some really exciting technology on the show floor this year, and so our goal is to make sure that our attendees get to spend time on the show floor and interact with that technology.\nSo how does the show floor look different than CES in Las Vegas? That is the touch point for so many of us, right? When you say CES, each of us has an individual view in mind, a picture of what we remember, or what we expect, or what really leapt out at us during the show. What about you? You attend both shows, roughly six months apart. Similarities and differences between the two for you.\nWell I think that's a very good question. It's one I get asked a lot, and I think as we've seen, CES Asia has grown and we've seen the show grow over the past five years, we're starting to see the two shows CES in Las Vegas, and CES Asia here in Shanghai really compliment each other well. So for instance, technologies that are launched are announced CES Asia in a short span of six months we often see that technology progress to see new iterations of it or new applications for that technology.\nFor an example, in 2018, the first AI enabled smartphone was launched at CES in Las Vegas. Six months later at CES Asia, the first AI enabled television was launched. So you're starting to see new applications for technology, and I think at the rate at which technology is advancing, six months is a perfect amount of time for a new touchpoint or a different touchpoint with the industry. So those in the industry can see the rate at which technology is progressing.\nMany of the same exhibitors that you see at CES are also present at CES Asia. So for instance, the Hycin, the Hire, the Hyundais, the Honda, Kia, Mercedes Benz, many of those are the same exhibitors that you see at CES in Las Vegas, and often times they will build a booth on similar scale to what they do in Las Vegas. However, one thing that I think is unique, is that 80% of the exhibitors that exhibit here at CES Asia or actually do not exhibit at CES in Las Vegas. So you're seeing new companies. You're seeing new companies that are pretty innovative. CES Asia is a curated show, meaning we review all applications that we receive for booth space, and surprisingly every year we do reject a fair amount of companies from the show because we don't feel like they're the right fit for CES Asia.\nSo it is somewhat of a curated experience to ensure that we maintaining the same quality and standards that we do at CES in Las Vegas.\nWell that's a cool point, John, and insightful that yes there are different companies involved, to a large extent, and some of the global players, the tech giants, or the auto giants, which you could argue are tech giants too are at both shows, but another key change, it seems to me is the fact that this is an exhibition in Asia for the Asian market, and so that means a different means of presentation, a different means of emphasizing various product lines, or strategic direction for companies, right? The fact that the audience is so different here.\nCorrect, and you are correct when you say that. An example here using Audi as an example, so Audi actually last week at a press event that we hosted here in China, made an announcement they will be launching a new product at CES Asia specifically aimed at the Chinese marketplace. And many companies follow the same pattern, the same strategy in the sense that they have products that they tailor specifically for this marketplace whether it be Asian marketplace, or specifically for the Chinese marketplace. It goes without saying that the needs of this marketplace are different than other parts of the world. So as a result of that, many companies adapt and change their business and their strategies to better serve the needs of this marketplace.\nLet's talk about some of the verticals, which maybe you can argue are horizontals too, but across the CES Asia show John. First and foremost, here is a close tie to CES in Las Vegas, and it's emblematic of the entire tech sector right now, that is the growth, the prominence, the emphasis on artificial intelligence, AI, at CES Asia.\nRight, and artificial intelligence is one of those technologies that we consider an ingredient technology, meaning it will be implemented in various products that you see throughout the show floor. So there might be an exhibitor that considers themself a smart home manufacturer, but in the end, they're really just showcasing some new application for artificial intelligence.\nThis year the artificial intelligence footprint at CES Asia, we estimate it to be up 25% over last year. And you'll see new applications in retail, content, digital health, and many more. So it should be a really exciting category at CES Asia this year.\nSo one of the topics that strikes me as a real growth area and emblematic of Asia and the tech scene overall, John, is the startup scene at CES Asia. I think that CES in Las Vegas is Eureka Park with more than 1,000 exhibitors from around the world, right? These startups, these entrepreneurs that are delivering game breaking, life changing innovations you may or may not recognize, right? When they actually come to market. That's a strong narrative, a real draw in Las Vegas for the show, but now this is becoming a point of emphasis in Shanghai too, right?\nCorrect. We launched what we call Startup Park, which is modeled after Eureka Park at CES, we launched that four years ago here at the show. This year we expect more than 115 exhibitors from seven countries and regions that will be presenting the newest, latest, most innovative technologies on the show floor. Some of the organizers, like CES, you see many country pavilion where countries or governments from different countries will organize exhibitors on the CES Asia show floor.\nRight, right.\nSo this year, we're expecting, in addition to, obviously they'll be multiple groups organizing Chinese exhibitors, but we're also expecting exhibitors from Switzerland and Norway will be organizing large pavilions on the show floor this year as well.\nAnd then, another marketplace you've alluded to with some of the big names, and you mentioned Mercedes, Audi, Hyundai, the vehicle technology sector. Every major player is in Las Vegas for CES in the auto sector, and it sounds like you're really moving toward the fact that that can be true of CES Asia as well.\nYeah, that is correct. The automobile story is fantastic at CES Asia. Again, at the beginning of this podcast, I mentioned explosive growth, this is one area that we're just seeing really explosive growth with respect to CES Asia. This year we expect more than 70 exhibitors in the auto category will be occupying almost two full halls in automobile technology at CES Asia in addition to outdoor driving experiences from Septio, and Audi. We feel like we are the largest technology trade show in Asia that features the automobile category. And again, it's just really amazing to see how many auto companies or auto suppliers are participating in CES Asia, and many do so because they're looking to partner with other tech companies. So you might see a partnership with one of the automobile companies with an internet company, an automobile company with more of a mobile company, and I think at it's core, that's really what CES Asia is. It's an opportunity to bring different industries together so they can partner, they can discuss new ideas, and really, they can learn from one another, because as we've seen at CES, and also now at CES Asia, it's really this convergence of industries where every industry is a technology, and it somehow is effected by technology, and most companies, or many companies nowadays consider themselves a technology company in one way or another.\nAll of our faithful CES Tech Talk podcasters are nodding along with you there John, because yes, every company is, or needs to be a tech company in today's business place.\nWhat about what's new in 2019? Who has you excited for first time exhibitors there in Shanghai?\nWe do have many new companies. I think one new company would be AIWAYS. DENSO is another one. Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Hyundai Mobis, [Polstar 00:13:54], Sonos, DN Motors. These are all new companies at CES Asia that are choosing to participate in our show, because they feel like it is the best opportunity to expose the Asian marketplace to their products and technologies.\nAnd another parallel, I know with Las Vegas, John, is the keynote scene, the conference sessions, all the programming that go into CES Asia, I find it, when I'm in Las Vegas, challenging sometimes to get to the show floor on a particular day or part of a day because the programmings so rich and I can't pull myself out of one room where it's one fascinating conversation after another. What's on tap in Shanghai this year?\nWell, correct, I mean we do have, our conference offerings are pretty extensive this year. So we're offering more than 30+ conference sessions on topics like AI vehicle technology, AR/VR, fashion technology that we have a session on sustainability. We also have a conference session the year focused on diversity in the workplace. So it's a very diverse, robust amount of conference program that we have at CES Asia this year. And you mentioned keynote, so we have announced five keynotes to date, AIWAY, Hyundai, Wacom, Horizon Robotics, and Audi. So these companies will be sending senior executives to CES Asia to make major keynotes announcements, highlight new products, partnerships, et cetera. Similar to how the keynotes at CES are run.\nAll right, John, before I let you go, what's availability like for folks who want to get to this show. I know the window is closing, but the window's still open right now to register and get there, right?\nThat is correct. So registration will be open through the show. So it's from now until June 10th you can register on our website, cesasia.com, or through our WeChat page, which is very popular here in China. We actually are offering a discounted registration fee of 50 RMB, so that's approximately eight US dollars, which is not much money. And then at the onsite fee will kick in on June 10th of 100 RMB or approximately $16.\nJohn Kelly is a busy man right now, no matter what time it is where you are listening in the world. He is the show director for CES Asia in Shanghai, China. John, one more time, the show dates are?\nJune 11th through the 13th and we hope to see all of you in Shanghai.\nAll right John, I'm a little rusty from my last trip to China, but [Speaking in Mandarin].\n[Speaking in Mandarin].\nI came close. All right. Thanks again, John, have a great show.\nThank you Tyler.\nRitch Wood is CEO of Nu Skin, a company you probably know well, but may not think of as a tech company precisely. Ritch, good to have you with us from Utah. I'd imagine the weather is just gorgeous out there right now.\nThank you very much, and it is a beautiful spring here in Utah.\nYeah, never run out of beautiful views out there. As I said, a lot of people know Nu Skin, a lot of you know, a lot of people know you in the health and wellness and beauty sector, maybe not so much as a technology company, but heck, we love to say it around CES, every company today is or needs to be a technology company, and clearly you and your team agree.\nWell, we totally agree with that. I'm fairly new CEO, two years in from becoming the CEO after being the CFO for about 15 years, and we feel very strongly that the company's who are really going to win and be successful going forward are those who are going to implement technology top to bottom in their companies.\nSo what does that look like at Nu Skin? If you would, just give us a bit of an overview of where the company is right now, two years into your tenure as CEO, and how that element of technology is not just becoming a pilar, but an overall ingredient in who an what Nu Skin is.\nWe developed a strategy of how to really drive our business forward through customer growth and as we look at our customer growth, it really happens in three ways. We call it our platform, our product, and our program approach to touching customers and bringing more customers to enjoy our product. As we talk about our platform, it really is utilizing social, selling and technology to make a better customer experience, and expand our reach of our sales leaders to be able to connect with more customers.\nFrom a product side, we have a platform of devices, we call them our beauty devices, which we utilize to deliver ingredients in a way that improved the experience and the efficacy of our products. So technology plays a key role in that. On the nutrition side, we focused on technology to help us develop an ingredient that's pure, clean, and sustainable and we will be highlighting this at CES, but it's indoor growing technology, which allows us to utilize much less space, much less water and resource to develop a higher efficiency ingredient that's clean, pure, and has no pesticide or herbicide. So that's really the product front and then I would say, on the program front, it's all about how we reward and recognize our sales leaders for their success and utilizing technology in that aspect as core to our ability to be successful. So it really does, as you mentioned, I think, flow through each aspect of our business, form essentially the foundation of how we generate our strategy going forward.\nSo I want to jump back to that sustainability angle, in just a moment Ritch, but first, the product overall, what are some examples, or even just one really sound example of a Nu Skin product, one of the benchmarks, one of the real traditional products you've always had, or you think of as a sales leader, and a means in which technology might be enhancing that?\nYeah, we have always focused on the name of the brand as Nu Skin, which is a personal care brand that we started back in 1984, we've had face care products that have been very, very successful. In the last two years, we launched a product that we called LumiSpa. It's a cleansing treatment device that you use with products that go with it to be very effective in cleaning, cleansing, and treating the skin on the face. It has increased the efficiency and enhancement of what would be our normal cleansing lotion on a face.\nMakes sense. Now, the other element, that I just touched on, sustainability. Controlled environment agriculture, the acronym that you all use is CEA, a pretty big name, but equated to some of what you started going down the road upon, Ritch, which is an easier and more sustainable way to get the ingredients that you need for your product.\nIt was about three years ago that we started investing in some technology to able to take the growing, which outdoors has a number of variables that are hard to control, water, light, wind, storms, things like that, and be able to take it indoor where we can control those and develop a recipe that gives a seed it's perfect day every day and allows it to be consistent, get the same result every single time.\nWe're now three years into this vision that's probably a longterm 10, 15, 20 year vision, but we're really getting to a point now where we'll start to have products that become available that are produced using the CEA technology and again, it uses just a fraction of the water and the land resources that are so valuable.\nRight, well especially important to an international company, and in many senses, your market is everywhere, but clearly a specific focus on the Asian markets. Why that focus and how'd you achieve that growth Ritch, and then as a second part of that question, why leverage CES Asia, what are you hoping to get there?\nOur business in Asia is extremely important to us, making up about 75% of our overall business. It really began in the early 90s when we opened our first Asian market, which was in Hong Kong, followed shortly thereafter in Taiwan, both markets, which have been successful for us, but it was really mainland China, which we opened in 2002 and really started to see our business take off in that region. Today, mainland China is our largest market, and greater China our largest region making up 33% or more of our sales, probably our biggest opportunity for growth going forward.\nSo a solid strategy for CES Asia, Ritch. What about Nu Skin and the CES, CES 2020 in Las Vegas, the health, the wellness, the beauty sector continues to grow as technology is driving both the product side and the consumer side. We all going to see you in Las Vegas in January?\nWe would love to be there, and that is our plan to continue to build both our story, our technology, as well as our visibility in terms of what we're doing with technology. So we definitely plan on being in Las Vegas next year with CES.\nAll right, Ritch Wood is CEO of Nu Skin. Getting ready for a major exhibit at CES Asia in Shanghai coming up June 11th through the 13th, and Ritch, look forward to getting to connect in person and talk to some BYU Cougars football I suppose when we see you in Las Vegas in January.\nWe'll plan on that. Thank you very much for your time.\nAs always, we want you to be CES ready. So here's what you can do. Yes, even this long before CES 2020 kicks off on January 7th in Las Vegas. Download the CES app. You can build your personal agenda, find your favorite exhibitors and speakers, and sync it all in realtime across your devices. Also, you can subscribe to the CES Tech Talk podcast, that way you won't miss a single episode as you're gearing up for the 2020 show. Again, that is January 7th through the 10th. CES 2020 in Las Vegas, and a reminder, none of this, nothing about this podcast is possible without our superstars executive producer Tina Anthony, and our senior engineer, John Lindsey, you all are the very best.\nThank you for joining us, I'm Tyler Suiters, let's talk tech again soon.\nCES is owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association, which provides the ultimate platform for technology leaders to connect, collaborate, and propel consumer technology forward.\nBecome a CTA Member\nAbout CES\nCES Events\nInnovation Awards\nCES Tech Talk Podcast\nPromote Your Brand\nTopics\nArticles\nCES Success Stories\nSchedule\nOur Partners\nInformation for:\nExhibitors\nMedia\nInternational\nFollow CES\nCode of Conduct\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nSitemap\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 - 2024.

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

With these internationally recognized certifications and premium materials, you can trust that our pellet grills are among the safest and highest quality available.\nThe certifications mentioned, like EN/GS/CE in Europe and ETL/CSA in North America, are common industry standards for grill safety and quality. Having these certifications means a grill meets minimum requirements, but more certifications can indicate a higher level of quality. Some points of comparison between grill manufacturers could be:\nNumber of certifications \u2013 More certifications usually means more rigorous testing and higher standards, so a manufacturer with 10+ certifications may have a higher-quality product than one with only 1-2 certifications.\nSpecific certifications \u2013 Higher-tier certifications, like ISO 9001 for quality management or Grade 304 stainless steel, demonstrate a stronger commitment to quality. If two brands have the same number of certifications, the one with more elite certifications may have a higher-quality grill.\nReputation \u2013 Independent reviews and customer feedback can also shed light on real-world quality and durability. A reputable brand with a long track record of high-quality grills is a safer choice than an unknown startup, even if they have the same certifications.\nSo while certifications provide a useful way to vet a grill\u2019s baseline quality and safety, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. Considering the number/types of certifications along with a brand\u2019s reputation and customer feedback will give you the fullest picture of how a grill\u2019s quality compares to competitors.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"
