        "raw_content": "Hyundai Mobis MOBION EV with e-Corner System Allows Sideways Movement on All Four Wheels\nAt CES 2024, global automotive supplier Hyundai Mobis introduced the MOBION electric vehicle (EV), equipped with their \u2018e-Corner System\u2019 motion technology. MOBION showcased unprecedented movement capabilities, including lateral, diagonal motion, and stationary pivot turns, captivating visitors and customers alike.\nAccording to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis, MOBION embodies the company\u2019s core technologies, all ready for mass production, and represents their commitment to reshaping the mobility landscape. The vehicle\u2019s e-Corner System, driven by \u201cIn-Wheel\u201d technology, allows individual control of each wheel, enabling dynamic maneuvers.\nAdditionally, MOBION incorporates autonomous driving sensors, lamp technologies, and a \u201cGround Projection\u201d function, emphasizing safety and practicality. By presenting a fully functional demonstration car, Hyundai Mobis aims to make its advanced technologies tangible and accessible to the real world.\nInnovative Display Technology\nBut, the technology that is expected to garner the most attention is the Innovative Transparent Display. The trend-setting display technology includes an in-vehicle rollable display, a swivel display, a Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display, and a 3D display with OLED-level LCD technology.\nThe tech we\u2019re hoping to see arrive in new Hyundai vehicles soon is the transparent display. The next-gen technology uses holographic optical elements to project driving information on a transparent panel. Think of a head-up display but with more width and depth.\nWith a transparent display, drivers no longer have to look to the center console for information. The transparent display can be projected and magnified on the front windshield, increasing safety on the road. As the images are holographic, drivers won\u2019t have to worry about the brightness that comes from illuminating modern head-up displays on dark windshields.\nIncreasing Charging Speed\nA common gripe among current and future EV owners is charging speed, and Hyundai has developed technology to curb the complaints: a 22kW ICCU. The integrated charging control unit is vital for charging the EV battery and converting the power to other electrical systems. Most EVs have an 11kW ICCU, but Hyundai Mobis will feature a 22kW unit in Las Vegas in early January.\nThe 22kW ICCU will speed up charging without altering vehicle specifications. EVs can only charge as fast as the vehicle and charging station allow. For example, if you have a typical EV with an 11kW ICCU, your EV can only take a maximum of 11kW of energy per hour, if your charger delivers that much. If you have a 77kWh battery, you\u2019ll need about seven hours to charge with a Level 2 charger. However, if you\u2019ve got a 22kW ICCU and your Level 2 charger can deliver 22kW per hour, you\u2019ll only need 3.5 hours to fill your 77kWh battery.\nThe new ICCU doesn\u2019t just take power from charging stations, it can also be used for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) activities. EV owners can use their vehicle\u2019s batteries as portable generators. This faster technology is ready for mass production.\nIMAGES: HYUNDAI MOBIS TECHNOLOGY\nFTC: We use income-earning auto affiliate links.\u00a0Learn more.\nAUTHOR:\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

During the exhibition, visitors and customers have the first-hand opportunity to experience MOBION moving in ways they may have never seen a vehicle move before, including lateral and diagonal motion, as well as stationary pivot turns.\n\"The MOBION represents the embodiment of Hyundai Mobis' core technologies, all of which are ready for immediate mass production,\" said Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. \"Always striving to shift the mobility paradigm with vehicles, Mobis created MOBION to showcase our key products and capabilities.\"\nTo enable sideways movement, diagonal driving, and pivot turns, MOBION's four wheels are individually controlled. The e-Corner System, responsible for translating these dynamic movements into reality, comprises four key technologies. At its core is the \"In-Wheel\" technology, which literally propels the EV forward.\n\"In-Wheel technology involves placing four small motors inside each wheel, as opposed to the single large driving motor commonly used in EVs,\" said Vice President Lee Young-kook, the Head of Electrification Lab. \"This configuration enables each wheel to generate its own power independently.\"\nMobis developed the e-Corner System by seamlessly integrating braking, steering, and suspension functions into the In-Wheel. Mobis has successfully secured advanced control technology that harmonizes each of these functions. In a global first, the company conducted successful on-road tests of the system's driving capabilities in 2023.\nBeyond its e-Corner System, MOBION is capturing attention at CES with its autonomous driving sensor and lamp technologies. As part of MOBION's design, three light detection and ranging (lidar) devices have been incorporated as autonomous driving sensors. Two short-distance lidars are positioned near the left and right headlamps, complemented by a single long-distance lidar installed at the center of the front of the vehicle. This configuration proves particularly valuable for lateral movement and effectively recognizing nearby objects, especially during maneuvers such as changing lanes diagonally.\nMobis has also introduced a new \"Exterior Lighting\" lamp along with various display functions. Notably, safety and design enhancements have been achieved through the installation of an LED on the front bumper. With the assistance of a short-distance lidar capable of recognizing pedestrians, valuable information is conveyed through the LED. For instance, when the vehicle is at an intersection, the LED displays the direction in which a pedestrian is crossing the street. Additionally, the rear bumper can alert drivers against changing lanes or passing, signaling that a pedestrian is crossing either to the left or right.\nMobis is showcasing its new \"Ground Projection\" function at CES as well. This feature complements the e-Corner System's movement capabilities by providing the vehicle's direction of travel. For instance, during diagonal or lateral movement, Ground Projection can illuminate the vehicle's direction on the ground, utilizing lights across a 360-degree spectrum. MOBION can even leverage Ground Projection to generate crosswalk stripes for pedestrians to use when they are detected.\nMOBION is a compound word formed by combing \"Mobis\" and the English word \"on.\" This nomenclature reflects Mobis' commitment to reimagining and spearheading the electrification of passenger vehicles. By unveiling a fully functional demonstration car at CES, as opposed to a mere conceptual announcement, Mobis aims to convey its confidence in the technologies underpinning MOBION. This approach is intended to make these advanced technologies both accessible and tangible, reinforcing their real-world applicability.\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea. Hyundai Mobis has outstanding expertise in sensors, sensor fusion in ECUs and software development for safety control. The company's products also include various components for electrification, brakes, chassis and suspension, steering, airbags, lighting, and automotive electronics.

        "raw_content": "Hyundai-owned Mobis bringing 20 innovations to CES 2024\nAmong them, a transparent infotainment display and the latest in sideways driving\nHyundai-owned Mobis will travel to CES 2024 to unveil new technologies that could trickle down to production models in the coming years. The supplier will showcase 20 innovations in the Las Vegas Convention Center, and it built a futuristic concept to demonstrate some of them.\nWhile the concept hasn't been unveiled yet, we can tell that its proportions straddle the thin line separating hatchbacks and crossovers. Its front end features numerous LED accents, including some that extend downward and continue above the rocker panels on both sides, but the yet-unnamed design study wasn't built to preview a next-generation design language. It's a rolling laboratory of software and hardware.\nOne of the features is the e-Corner technology that Hyundai demonstrated earlier in 2023. Put simply, this system allows the four wheels to turn by 90 degrees to let a car slide sideways into a parking spot \u2014 it's a boon for those who never really learned how to parallel park. Time will tell whether Mobis has made changes to the e-Corner system since we first saw it, and whether the brand plans to bring it to production.\nMobis will put a big focus on how information is presented to the driver and the passengers during the show. One of the highlights is a see-through display that looks designed to stretch across most of the dashboard; it encompasses the instrument cluster and the infotainment system's display. The brand reasons that this layout reduces driver distractions by putting key information closer to the driver's line of sight.\nOther innovations include what Mobis refers to as \"a rollable display,\" a swiveling display, a Quantum Dot and Local Dimming display, and a 3D display with OLED-like graphics. These features haven't been detailed yet, but Mobis stresses that they're more realistic than you might assume. It expects that its transparent display \"will bring many changes to future automobile designs\" once it enters production, and it expects \"significant demand\" from carmakers around the globe. Mobis is owned by Hyundai, but it supplies parts to other companies.\nCES 2024 will open its doors in Las Vegas on January 8. Mobis notes that the innovations it will show there are ready for mass production.\nHyundai\nInformation\nPopular Now\nHertz's Tesla liquidation sale likely means more depreciation for used EVs\nPorsche Macan EV previewed in official sketches, days ahead of its reveal\nEngineering Explained figures the towing Cybertruck didn't out-drag a 911\n2024 Acura ZDX price starts at $64,500 before destination, incentives\nHyundai Palisade spy photos show Ioniq-inspired styling\n2025 Buick Enclave teased with Wildcat EV styling language\nFollow Us\nResearch\nPopular Vehicles\nPopular New Vehicles\nPopular Used Vehicles\nPopular Electric Vehicles\nPopular Truck Vehicles\nPopular Crossover Vehicles\nPopular Luxury Vehicles\nPopular Hybrid Vehicles\nPopular Makes\nFeatured Makes\nProduct Guides\nChoose a Display Name\nPlease enter a display name\nSign in to post\nPlease sign in to leave a comment."

        "raw_content": "Select Page\nHyundai Mobis to showcase display and charging tech at CES 2024\nPosted by Gary Mason | Dec 20, 2023 | Electrification, Interiors, News, User Experience\nAt the CES 2024 show in Las Vegas next month, Hyundai Mobis is planning to present 20 new mobility technologies that it says are ready for immediate mass production. The supplier says it is aiming to diversify its client base and expand global orders through aggressive marketing, highlighting the company\u2019s technological capabilities and product quality.\nAmong the products that will be showcased to potential clients in areas such as electrification, lighting, and AAM (advanced air mobility) will be future mobility core technologies such as the Innovative Display series, which the company says is \u201crich\u201d in high-value advanced technology, and a high-power ICCU (integrated charging control unit).\nThe Innovative Display series is a collection of new products for automobiles that features the world\u2019s first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, a quantum dot and local dimming display, and a 3D display that features OLED-level performance in an LCD.\nRevealed last month, the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d QL display combines quantum dot technology, which enhances color reproduction for a more realistic depiction of original colors, with local dimming technology, which increases the contrast between light and dark colors for more precise image quality. The display maximizes brightness and clarity while offering the flexibility of slimmer thickness.\nWhile the currently popular OLED displays offer high performance, their high cost limits widespread application, according to the supplier. In contrast, the QL is a next-generation premium product considered on par with OLED in terms of performance but with more competitive pricing.\nHyundai Mobis says that the global vehicle display market is trending toward luxury with integrated large-screen structures extending from the driver to the passenger side. Technology such as the QL display, which enables high definition and slim design, is essential for mass production.\nThe supplier is actively seeking new order opportunities in the premium vehicle display sector leveraging the QL. With enhanced color reproduction and contrast ratio to OLED levels, the QL prototype features a large, 27-in, curved screen and a 14.5-mm design that can be slimmed down to about 10 mm by customer request.\nThe supplier will also present a transparent display for automobiles for the first time, the product a next-generation display that employs holographic optical element technology. The company says its new display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a \u201cwider sense of space and openness\u201d than that of general displays.\nAnother focal point of the Hyundai Mobis exhibit will be a new high-power ICCU, a key element for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The 22-kW-class power conversion system integrates elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. It is closely related to vehicle-to-grid technology, enabling an electric car battery to be used as a large power source for external uses.\nThe higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If a 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an EV with the same specifications as an 11-kW version, the vehicle\u2019s charging time is reduced by half, according to the company.\nThe new ICCU has received the green light for mass production.\nKevin Jost contributed to this article.\nRelated\nJoin the movement\nBecome a part of the Futurride.com community to receive updates from our team, our weekly enewsletters, and full access to our content.\nYou have successfully joined!\nShare:\nAbout The Author\nGary Mason, a Futurride contributor, is a storyteller and communications professional with more than 10 years of experience in the automotive industry.

This next-generation 'e-Corner System' motion technology transforms mobility in this unique vehicle. Hyundai Mobis' crab walking idea revolutionizes road handling.\nHyundai Mobis: Mobion, Unique Concept\nHyundai Mobis introduced Mobion, a game-changing electric car that astounds onlookers with its extraordinary mobility capabilities at CES 2024. Mobion's e-Corner System allows for unequaled pivot turns and tight-space navigation on the road.\nAt the core of this innovation lies Hyundai Mobis' groundbreaking e-Corner System, enabling not only sideways and diagonal motion but also pivot turning. Unlike most production electric vehicles relying on a single, larger electric motor to drive the front or rear axles, Mobis has taken a unique approach. They have equipped each wheel with its own electric motor, a technology known as In-Wheel motor technology.\nAs reported in Gulf News\u00a0\u00a0Hyundai's, Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, Head of Advanced Engineering stated that Mobion encapsulates the culmination of Hyundai Mobis' core technologies, meticulously prepared for large-scale manufacturing.\nAdvanced Wheel Technology/Control: E- Corner System\nReports described Mobis'\u00a0in wheel control and technology as a problem solver. This particularly gives solutions to parking problems. With the Hyundai Mobis Crab Walking Concept, one can effortlessly engage the desired mode by simply pressing a button, facilitated by a comprehensive array of onboard sensors to effortlessly navigate into the desired parking space.\nREAD MORE: GM Rolls Out $7,500 Incentive on EVs Disqualified for Tax Credit\nThe vehicle's fully autonomous wheels grant it the capability to move diagonally in both forward and backward directions, execute 180-degree spins with remarkable agility, and perform precise 'pivot turns,' as officially described.\nThis concept replaces the single motor with four small motors in each wheel. Thus, enabling \"In-Wheel\" autonomous propulsion and steering. Within the In-Wheel system, Mobis seamlessly fuses braking, steering, and suspension, ensuring a harmonious and coordinated motion.\nGround Projection System\nThe South Korean automaker's \"Ground Projection\" system improves puddle illumination for pedestrian safety. Instead of merely showcasing a logo on the ground for aesthetic purposes, this system has the capacity to project images and warnings in a 360-degree fashion around the vehicle.\nHyundai Mobis' technology projects flashing arrows when the vehicle executes a pivot turn or signals its movement direction during crab walking. Moreover, it has the capability to create a pedestrian crosswalk on the road surface when it detects the presence of pedestrians.\nThough the legal implications of this function on Mobion are unclear, reports say.\nOther Notable Features from Mobion\nHyundai Mobis' Mobion is not just about its impressive Crab Walking Concept; it also incorporates advanced autonomous driving sensor and lamp technologies. Mobion relies on three strategically placed lidar sensors for autonomy.\nShort- and long-range Lidar sensors detect and avoid objects during maneuvers to enable autonomous driving. To sum it up, Mobion's agile motions derive from its wheels' individual control, is facilitated by the cutting-edge e-Corner System.\nThe \"Exterior Lighting\" system improves safety and appearance. Using data from short-distance lidar, an LED on the front bumper provides pedestrian crossing directions at intersections, while rear bumper LEDs use the same technology to warn drivers about pedestrians crossing to the left or right, effectively reducing the risk of lane change accidents.\nRELATED ARTICLE: Bmmpr Showcases Lightning, Restored 1967 Mustang Fastback at CES 2024\nCopyright @ MOTORTIMES, All rights reserved.

The company plans to capture the next-generation vehicle display market with high-specification performance and competitive pricing.\nHyundai Mobis has announced the world's first development of a QL Display (Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display) for vehicles on 30th. The QL Display combines 'Quantum Dot' technology, which enhances color reproduction for a more realistic depiction of original colors, and 'Local Dimming' technology, which increases the contrast between light and dark colors for more precise image quality. The display maximizes brightness and clarity while offering the flexibility to slim down in thickness according to customer needs.\nThe QL Display is recognized as a next-generation premium product in the vehicle display market. While the currently popular OLED displays offer high performance, their high-cost limits widespread application. In contrast, the QL Display is considered on par with OLED in terms of performance but also boasts competitive pricing.\nHyundai Mobis' self-designed and developed QL Display enhances color reproduction and contrast ratio to OLED levels. It also features a 27-inch large, curved screen and a slim 14.5mm design, with adaptability to slim down to approximately 10mm per customer requests. The global vehicle display market is trending towards luxury with integrated large-screen structures extending from the driver's seat to the passenger side. Technology such as the QL Display, which enables high definition and slim design, is essential for mass production.\nHyundai Mobis is actively seeking new order opportunities in the premium vehicle display sector, leveraging its newly developed QL Display. The company plans to visit global automaker clients in North America and Europe to introduce and demonstrate the technology, highlighting the product's competitiveness. Following the development of the world's first rollable display last year, Hyundai Mobis is further strengthening its competitive edge in the next-generation display sector by introducing the QL Display this year.\nConsidering the trend among global automakers to apply advanced displays with various features to establish distinctive brand images, such capabilities in new technologies are expected to expand new business opportunities and secure market leadership with advanced technology competitiveness. Hyundai Mobis intends to aggressively highlight its display technology prowess at global mobility events like CES and leverage these technological strengths to dominate the premium vehicle display market.\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea.

The company will present 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production.\nAt CES, Mobis will focus its efforts on growing its international sales by targeting global clients. Various products in areas such as automotive components, electrification, lamp and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will be showcased to potential clients, including its future mobility core technologies, such as the Innovative Display series \u2014 rich in high-value advanced technology \u2014 and the high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU).\nThe Innovative Display series, which is a collection of high-value, cutting-edge technologies, will be the focus at the Mobis exhibition. The company will present its leading innovative display technologies for automobiles, such as the world's first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, as well as the Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display (QL) display and 3D display that feature OLED-level performance in LCD.\nA transparent display for automobiles will be presented for the first time during the exhibition. This product is a next-generation display which employs holographic optical elements technology. The display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays.\nTransparent displays enable images to be magnified on the front windshield. Thus, drivers can check various display information without shifting their gaze too much, increasing the level of safety. Because of their unique features, it is expected that transparent displays will bring many changes to future automobile designs once they are mass produced. Estimates indicate significant demand from global car manufacturers, creating high expectations for the display's future technological development and mass production.\nInnovative technologies in the field of electrification, the driving force for future growth, also await to be selected by global automakers based on Mobis' abundant mass production know-how. At the center of electric driving is the 22 kW-class ICCU, which Mobis proudly presents along with its battery system (BSA).\nICCU is a key element for electric vehicle charging and driving and is a power conversion system integrating elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention. This system allows all four wheels to turn 90 degrees, enabling parallel movement.\n* Hyundai Mobis Booth:\nLas Vegas\nConvention Center, West Hall #5216\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in\nSeoul, Korea\n.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMES TO YOUR CAR\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nHONDA\u2019S HEADED BACK TO THE FUTURE\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nELECTRIC FLYING CARS PROMISE TO BECOME REALITY\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The highlight is the Mobion concept, which is apparently based on the Ioniq 5 and features a unique design.\nThe company is keeping details under wraps, but confirmed it will be equipped with an e-Corner System that enables all four wheels to turn up to 90 degrees. This allows the vehicle to drive in virtually any direction.\nWe can also get a glimpse of \u201cInteraction Lighting\u201d units. Little is known about them, but they apparently feature \u2018swiping\u2019 motions.\nMore: Hyundai Ioniq 5 With e-Corner Tech Gets Crab Mode, Can Turn Wheels 90 Degrees\nBesides the concept, the company will showcase the world\u2019s first in-vehicle rollable display. It will be joined by a transparent display, which \u201cemploys holographic optical elements technology.\u201d The company didn\u2019t go into many specifics, but noted the transparent nature of the display creates a sense of space and openness.\nOn the electric vehicle side, the company will showcase a high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit. It\u2019s rated at 22 kW and this could halve the recharging time of EVs equipped with more conventional 11 kW ICCUs. The company also suggested it was designed with vehicle-to-grid technology in mind.\nIn total, Hyundai Mobis will show 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production. The company also noted they\u2019re looking to diversify its customer base and increase sales by highlighting their \u201ctechnological capabilities and product quality\u201d at CES.\nPost navigation\nFollow Us"
