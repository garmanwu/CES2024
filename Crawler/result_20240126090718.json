        "raw_content": "Home > Articles > Features\nMSI Makes a Big Splash at CES 2024 With New Laptop Lineup\nCES 2024 is filled with laptops of all shapes and sizes, bringing the latest technology to the mobile office. Leading the pack at CES 2024 is MSI with this year\u2019s slate. MSI continues to push boundaries with unique designs and powerful specs, pushing the limits on what you can do with a mobile computer. I got hands-on time with these hot new models at CES and came away thoroughly impressed, getting a sense of the exciting series of devices waiting to ship to consumers in the coming months.\nThere has been a lot of excitement around AI and how it can add to your daily life, from Stable Difusion and AI images to the excitement around ChatGPT and the potential for the technology. MSI has embraced the potential of what AI can do and incorporated the technology directly into this year\u2019s laptop range.\nWith Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra series, the ability to manage AI directly on your laptop is now possible, and MSI has taken up this challenge with open arms. From noise cancellation to the new AI Artist, the new AI features that will be coming to Core Ultra laptops feel like they could be a game changer for people who create content on the go.\nGoing beyond fancy AI, the most exciting offerings are still the laptops themselves, boasting some staggering features that allow you to make the most of your machine whether you are at home or on the go. The power under the hood of these machines is impressive, and I have only had a brief look. I can\u2019t wait to actually do a deeper dive into what I can do with the power and features of these new MSI laptops being showcased at CES 2024.\nMSI\u2019s CES 2024 Lineup:\nMSI Titan 18 HX\nLeading the charge is MSI\u2019s new flagship\u2014the jaw-dropping Titan 18 HX. Destined to be the dream machine for enthusiasts, this absolute beast of a laptop packs MSI\u2019s first ever 18-inch 4K 120Hz mini LED display, achieving an insane 1000 nits brightness for stunning HDR visuals. It\u2019s all powered by a 14th-Gen Intel processor and MSI Overboost Ultra technology, allowing for a blazing 270W combined CPU and GPU power draw. It also boasts powerful NVIDIA discrete graphics to push as many polygons as possible, making sure you make the most of the massive 18\u201d 4K 120Hz display.\nWhat does this mean for the average gamer? Extreme desktop-class performance you can take on the go. The Titan 18 HX also debuts MSI\u2019s new Vapor Chamber cooler with dual fans and quad exhausts, plus a funky 3D cooling stand with raised bumps on the bottom to keep things cool even when pushing the laptop to its limits. This is a machine that is built to take on anything, and it does so in style.\nMSI Titan 18 HX Specs:\nMSI Raider 18 HX\nSitting just below the Titan 18 sits the Raider 18 HX, offering DNA similar to the showstopping Mystic Light Matrix bar across the front. Its menacing black and red colour scheme looks ready to take on anything, while the per-key RGB keyboard from SteelSeries lets your creativity shine. You still get the same impressive 18-inch panel and powerful specs as the Titan 18, providing a nice alternative flavour that\u2019s a bit easier on the wallet.\nMSI Raider 18 HX Specs:\nStealth 18 AI Studio\nOn the creator side, MSI revealed the sleek Stealth 18 AI Studio laptop featuring Intel Core Ultra, which is optimized for AI development and power efficiency. The most unique aspect is its venting design, with a completely porous bottom panel made from a stainless steel mesh. Combined with up to a 185W total power draw, the Stealth 18 AI Studio can sustain heavy computational workloads. It shares the same gorgeous 18-inch 4K display and cooling system as its Titan HX and Raider siblings. Throw in per-key RGB, ambient lighting, and a premium keyboard, and you have an impressive machine-learning development platform.\nStealth 18 AI Studio Specs:\nPrestige 16 AI Evo & Prestige 16 AI Studio\nPerhaps some of the most elegant laptops in the full CES 2024 lineup are the Prestige series. These stunning machines pack serious power into slim, stylish chassis, aiming to satisfy creative pros needing desktop 4K OLED display while Intel Core Ultra CPUs and RTX GPUs chew through demanding workflows. Even under full load, heat pipe cooling keeps noise modest. For even greater portability, MSI scales down to a 14-inch Prestige variant, retaining the premium metal design and delivering the Intel Core Ultra power with a bit less bulk for when you are on the go.\nThe Prestige AI 16 is now out, and you can purchase it from BestBuy.\nPrestige Series Specs:\nMSI CYBORG 14\nLastly, MSI announced the surprisingly affordable CYBORG 14 laptop. Don\u2019t let these 14-inch size devices fool you \u2014 they still pack a punch with 13th-Gen Intel processors and RTX 40 series graphics. Tipping the scales at just 1.6kg, the CYBORG 14 is extremely portable with its slim 18.6mm z-height chassis. Gamers will also appreciate the 16:10 aspect ratio display, Ethernet port, and unique transparent top panel exposing the internal components. Despite the smaller footprint, the CYBORG 14 includes blue backlighting and the performance needed for AAA gaming.\nFor those who want to experience the latest Intel chips and the power of AI, MSI has the CYBORG 15 laptops, which feature a discrete NVIDIA GPU, a 144Hz matrix display, a Core Ultra CPU, an RGB keyboard, a 31 percent larger trackpad, all the latest DDR5 memory and PCI-E SSD. Don\u2019t forget that it comes complete with the latest AI features that make this latest range from MSI so unique, including AI Artist, bringing the perfect mix of performance and future-proof tech to make sure you are ready for everything 2024 has to throw at you.\nMSI CYBORG 14 Specs:\nMSI brought thoughtful designs and spec sheets to satisfy even the most demanding users at CES 2024. From ultra-enthusiasts wanting no compromises with the Titan 18 to budget gamers eyeing the svelte CYBORG 14, MSI has everyone covered. The MSI 2024 laptop lineup manages to be well-rounded and diverse to meet different needs, meaning both gamers and creators have a lot to be excited about. After getting personal hands-on time with these systems at CES 2024, I can confidently say MSI is kicking off 2024 very strongly.\nThe story above is sponsored and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of CGMagazine or its staff.\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 First Look: 18-Inch MSI Stealth, Raider, and Titan Laptops Are a Power Trio\nPacking Intel's new Core Ultra and 14th Gen \"Raptor Lake Refresh\" CPUs, and up to Nvidia RTX 4090 GPUs, this fresh array of big-screen laptops looks impressive. We previewed each system ahead of its CES debut.\nI\u2019m one of the consumer PC experts at PCMag, with a particular love for PC gaming. I've played games on my computer for as long as I can remember, which eventually (as it does for many) led me to building and upgrading my own desktop. Through my years here, I've tested and reviewed many, many dozens of laptops and desktops, and I am always happy to recommend a PC for your needs and budget.\nMSI revealed a slew of new gaming and professional laptops at CES 2024, including three 18-inch machines across the Stealth, Raider, and Titan lines.\nThe laptop maker paid us a visit prior to the announcements at CES, where we were able to spend some time with the Stealth 18 AI Studio, the Raider 18, and the Titan 18. In addition to their prodigious screen size, these laptops come packing the latest Intel Core Ultra and 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d HX processors.\nYou can watch our rundown in the video above, and check out more details below.\nStealth 18 AI Studio: Sleek Power for Creative Pros\nMSI\u2019s Stealth line (we reviewed the MSI Stealth 14 Studio last year) has straddled the line between creative professional use and gaming, and the new 18-inch model will look to achieve both at a high level. As the name suggests, these laptops are always on the thinner and sleeker side. That usually comes with some performance limitations\u2014the thinner the chassis, the less room it has for cooling.\nIn precise terms, it measures 0.9 by 15.7 by 11.4 inches (HWD) and 6.39 pounds. The slim-first idea perhaps makes less sense at 18 inches than smaller sizes, since it's not the most travel-friendly size to begin with. But, at least it\u2019s easier to take with you when needed, even if it will mostly serve as a desktop replacement otherwise. Compared with the other machines we\u2019ll touch on in a moment, I felt it wasn\u2019t too bad to carry around, but still not ideal.\nThe sleek look comes through, though. The simple style and smooth lid fits the concept well, and the chassis isn\u2019t overly adorned in general. The magnesium alloy body feels pleasant in-hand, and needless to say you have plenty of screen real estate to enjoy. The mini LED panel measures 18 inches diagonally, with up to a UHD+ (3,840 by 2,400) resolution.\nComponents are what really pushes a creative professional laptop forward at the end of the day, and the Stealth 18 looks to deliver. MSI has opted for Intel\u2019s Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors here, unlike the 14th Gen chips in the pure gaming systems, which makes sense given the AI readiness.\nCore Ultra processors include an onboard neural processing unit, or NPU, that crunches through local AI workloads without burdening the CPU. The Stealth 18 AI Studio will run up to the Core Ultra 9 tier, as well as up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, for the most serious pro-grade workloads.\nMore use cases for local AI will come, but MSI\u2019s AI Engine is a decent starting point for the type of background assistance it can provide. This will dynamically switch your performance tuning behind the scenes depending on what application you have open\u2014you can see it in action in our preview of MSI\u2019s Prestige laptops. MSI will set the starting price for this stealthy 18-incher at $ 3,299, though availability information for this model isn't yet available.\nRaider 18 HX: One for the Hardcore Gaming Crowd\nMoving into the next power tier here, we have the gaming-focused Raider 18. We last reviewed a 16-inch MSI Raider GE68HX in 2023. The Titan is a step beyond this, which we'll get to next, but even for most enthusiasts, you really need to go this high in the hierarchy.\nA thicker 18-inch machine, this has a top-end power ceiling, but it's not worried much about portability. Even more so than the Stealth 18, this is a desktop-replacement laptop, with a monitor-like display. The panel features a QHD+ (2,560-by-1,600-pixel) resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, which is a fine fit for high-fps and AAA gaming.\nSet this up on your desk as your main gaming station, and move it into the other room for more casual use as needed. I don't think many frequent trips with this are expected, though it\u2019s not as big as it could be\u2014MSI describes it as an 18-inch screen in a 17-inch chassis, as we\u2019re seeing many manufacturers achieve this with thin bezels\u2014but it still weighs a hefty 7.93 pounds. A front-facing LED bar adds some flair into this mostly stationary beast.\nOn the component front, the Raider 18 goes with Intel\u2019s 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d processors instead of the Meteor Lake chips, up to the Core i9-14900HX. It, too, maxes out at an RTX 4090, for a 250-watt (W) system total (175W GPU, 75W CPU), though many gamers can be content with an RTX 4070 or RTX 4080. MSI has not yet released price or availability information for this model just yet.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nTitan 18 HX: The Cream of the Crop for Enthusiast Gamers\nThe Raider 18 has most gamers covered for power, but a rare tier of shoppers want (and can afford) the best possible equipment bar none. As such, I don't expect most of you to realistically consider the Titan, with the lowest-cost model at $4,999, but it's impressive nonetheless. The previous Titan behemoth we reviewed packed a 13th Gen Core i9 and an RTX 4090. Most manufacturers sell this type of showcase device that demonstrates the current performance peak, and the specs back that up.\nThe core components top out where the others do (because there\u2019s nowhere further to go), up to the Core i9-14900HX CPU and an RTX 4090 GPU at 175W. Vapor-chamber cooling, a maximum of 128GB of memory, and up to 3TB of SSD storage support this ultimate, technically mobile, desktop replacement.\nThe display is no slouch either, beyond its size: This is a 4K mini LED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, which MSI says is a world-first combination. That\u2019s a dream panel for many, even if you don\u2019t want to play every game at 4K; some may also prefer a lower resolution and higher refresh rate option. But the mini LED is crisp and super bright, rated at 1,000 nits.\nOther factors that add to the Titan\u2019s premium status include an RGB touchpad and key lighting, a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, and MSI\u2019s Overboost technology, which allows for the boost to 270W total CPU and GPU system power.\nWhile we know how much the new 18-inch Titan will cost, $4,999 to start, MSI has not revealed when exactly this laptop will be released. We\u2019ll have reviews of these systems as they become available, when we can test these powerful parts ourselves, so check back later this year for fully tested coverage.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nCES 2024: MSI\u2019s laptops get smarter, bigger, and more powerful\nMSI is very aptly focusing on AI for its newest laptop lineup, unveiling a host of AI ready laptops at the Consumer Electronic Show 2024 (CES), currently underway in Las Vegas. The offering includes laptops with Intel\u2019s hotly anticipated NPU (Neural-processing unit) stacked Intel Core Ultra Processor, which has been especially optimized for sustained AI workloads.\nMSI laptops featuring the Intel Ultra chips will be denoted by the suffix \u2018AI\u2019 after their name this year. As you would expect, the chips will feature in some of the company\u2019s full-power gaming laptops, like the Pulse 16 AI and 17 AI, but won\u2019t just be limited to these rigs. New MSI Cyborg 15 AI and Thin 15 AI laptops will also get Intel Ultra processors, giving mainstream gamers access to the hardware too.\nMSI\u2019s productivity and creator lineups also get an AI upgrade, with the company announcing the new Prestige AI Series of lightweight productivity laptops and a new AI version of the MSI Creator 16 Studio laptop \u2013 both offerings born of the need for creators and workers to better handle the increasing AI demands in an everchanging workplace, says MSI.\nThe new MSI Prestige Series includes Prestige 16, 14 and 13 models, all of which pack Intel\u2019s special Ultra processors, with some models including the top-tier Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor.\nNew MSI Prestige AI laptops will also feature Intel Ultra processors.\nMSI\nThe new MSI Creator 16 AI Studio laptop won\u2019t just be optimized for AI, however \u2013 it also promises better visuals than its 2023 predecessor, featuring a UHD+ MiniLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop\u2019s display will also be made in the taller 16:10 aspect ratio, which was highly sought after among creators last year.\nProductivity and creator laptops will also feature freshly rejigged designs in 2024 \u2013 MSI promises they\u2019ll be lighter than previous years, but with longer battery lives. The new Prestige 16 AI, for example, will sport a magnesium alloy body and weigh just 3.3 pounds, but MSI claims its 99.9WHr battery will last a full 19 hours.\nMSI\u2019s 2024 Prestige 13 AI Evo, on the other hand, weighs a miniscule 2.2 pounds but sports a 75WHr battery that MSI claims is 50 percent larger than laptops of the same size by rival manufacturers.\nWhy are Intel\u2019s new Ultra processors ideal for AI processing?\nIntel\u2019s Ultra processors are a new iteration of CPUs in an ever-evolving line of intelligent silicon. CPUs in the series are built on a new Intel 4 processing node and feature dedicated Neutral-processing units (NPUs), especially designed to perform AI tasks faster than previous generation CPUs, and most GPUs.\nThe big benefit here is that the NPU can reduce the processing load on a laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU when processing repetitive AI tasks, thereby allowing these chips to work more efficiently. The integration of ARC graphics in the Core Ultra chip is also said to offer more than double the graphical output per watt compared to previous generations \u2013 which promises a big performance boost for light graphical tasks like light gaming.\nBigger more powerful rigs land in 2024\nLaptops with increased power outputs and larger chassis also feature strongly in MSI\u2019s 2024 offering. To be sure, more MSI gaming and creator laptops will get fresh power boosts thanks to Intel 14th Gen mobile HX Series processor upgrades.\nGaming laptops to show off upgraded HX Series silicon include new MSI Vector 16/17 HX models featuring Intel Core i9-14900HX processors, as well as brand new Crosshair 17/16 HX and Sword 17/16 HX models \u2013 which will sport Intel Core i7-14700HX processors.\nIntel\u2019s 14th Gen HX mobile processors may not be especially designed for AI processing, but they\u2019re similarly well optimized for AI purely since they\u2019re extremely fast and have a low task latency. Top tier 14th Gen Intel mobile HX CPUs, for example, can reach a whopping 5.8GHz maximum clock speed. They also come with Intel Application Optimizer for thread optimization in gaming \u2013 so they promise faster and more powerful gaming performance than ever before.\nMSI has announced new MSI Vector and Crosshair laptops featuring 14th Gen Intel HX Series mobile processors. New Pulse models get new Intel Ultra CPUs.\nMSI\nAll of these models will come with Nvidia AI ready RTX 40 Series GPUs \u2013 which include Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered DLSS3 technology and AI Tensor Cores \u2013 and with designs that boast six air vent chambers for heat dissipation. These laptops will also sport impressive power outputs \u2013 the Vector 17 HX, for example, stands out from the bunch; it features MSI Overboost technology for a maximum output of 250W.\nFor those that can\u2019t get enough power or immersive visuals, MSI has also just announced a new 18-inch gaming laptop family at CES 2024. The family includes laptop models carrying MSI Titan HX, MSI Raider HX and MSI Stealth 18 AI Studio brand names.\nAmong this lot, gamers will find models featuring 18-inch 4K,120Hz MiniLED displays with DisplayHDR 1000 and wide color gamuts for brilliant visuals. The Titan HX looks to be the most impressive of the selection \u2013 its top tier configuration will be a beast of a laptop, packing no less than an Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, 18-inch 4K display, Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU and a whopping 270W power.\nMSI\u2019s new AI Software Suite\nIt\u2019s a no brainer that hardware is only as good as the software that runs off it, which accounts for why MSI has also announced a suite of AI-driven software at CES 2024. Dubbed the \u2018MSI AI Software Suite\u2019 by the company, the collection includes three programs: AI Engine, AI Artist and AI Noise Cancellation. We\u2019ve summarized these below:\nAI Engine \u2013 Automatically optimizes laptop settings such as the display, audio, power profiles and the keyboard backlight based on the application that you\u2019re currently using. It aims to automate a lot of the fiddly background settings adjustment you may have previously had to do. AI Artist \u2013 An offline text-to-image service that eliminates network latency and data leakage. It offers features like image-to-image, image-to-text and the exporting of layered PSD files for Photoshop editing to greatly simplify these processes for creative professionals.AI Noice Cancellation Pro \u2013 An AI-powered noise cancellation software. This software optimizes the use of the laptop\u2019s microphone hardware to improve the quality of audio for meetings or recording sessions.\nMSI has announced MSI AI Suite, a collection of software aimed at utilizing the new AI hardware in the company\u2019s 2024 lineup.\nMSI\nCoupon Codes\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nDeals\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nManage Subscription\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nMSI Stealths into CES 2024 with a monster of a Titan and a brutal Raider\nReady to break open the bank?\nCES 2024 is pumping out a wave of new laptops, CPUs, and exciting tech that we'll see flow in throughout the year. MSI is breaking backs out here like Bane to Batman with all-new Titan, Raider, and Stealth laptops coming through.\nThe MSI Titan HX is launching with a whopping $4,999 starting price, while the Raider GE68 HX and Stealth 16 AI Studio start at $2,499 and $2,099, respectively. They're slated to release sometime in 2024.\nHere's what we know so far.\nWe're on the scene in Las Vegas to check out the latest tech at this year's CES 2024 showcase. Be sure to tag along on our CES 2024 journey by following Laptop Mag on TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram, Flipboard, and Facebook for the most up to date hands-on impressions and news coming from the convention floor.\nCES 2024: MSI Titan, Raider, Stealth specs & features\nIf there's anything MSI is good at, it's gaming laptops and their many configurations. Let's run through what we can expect from the latest Titan, Raider, and Stealth.\nKicking off with the king, a.k.a the MSI Titan 18 HX, you can configure this machine with up to an Intel Core i9-14900HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 128GB of RAM (yes, seriously), a 4TB SSD, and an 18-inch, 4K+, Mini LED display clocked at 120Hz. What a beast.\nAt the middle of the pack in terms of size, we've got the MSI Raider GE68 and GE78 \u2014 the difference being a 16-inch or 17-inch display, respectively.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Hands On: MSI Claw Bets on Intel for Handheld Gaming Supremacy\nMSI's Intel-powered gaming handheld puts Meteor Lake into the hottest new gaming hardware trend. We go hands-on with it at CES 2024.\nIf you\u2019re after laptop buying advice, I\u2019m your man. I\u2019ve been reviewing PCs and technology products for more than a decade. I cut my teeth in PC Labs, spending several years with PCMag.com before writing for other outlets, among them LaptopMag.com and Tom\u2019s Guide. While computers are my main focus, I\u2019ve also written at length about topics ranging from fitness gear and appliances to TV and home theater equipment. If I\u2019ve used it, I have opinions about it, whether somebody\u2019s paying me to write them up or not.\nLAS VEGAS\u2014One of the coolest things we've seen at CES 2024 is the MSI Claw, the latest PC-based handheld gaming device announced at the show. With PC power inside, running on an Intel Core Ultra processor with the latest Intel Arc integrated graphics, it's the first Meteor Lake-powered model in the growing family of compact PC gaming devices. I enjoyed some hands-on time with the MSI Claw here, and while I didn't get a chance to have a full gaming session, or run any benchmark tests, I can tell you a bit about the hardware itself.\nMSI Claws at the Competition\nLike the Valve Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, this is a compact handheld gaming system, with built-in grips and game controls that fit around a 7-inch screen made for gaming on the go. The Claw follows this basic design template in most respects, but MSI has learned from its competitors to bring some interesting and innovative touches to the fairly new category.\nThe biggest, as mentioned above, is the inclusion of Intel Core Ultra processors, ranging from an Intel Core Ultra 5 135H CPU up to a Core Ultra 7 155H chip in the top configuration.\nThe device is fairly lightweight compared with its competitors, and features plenty of built-in cooling to avoid some of the overheating problems that have plagued the first wave of such devices. Aside from the handgrips, most of the handheld chassis is vented for ample airflow, which will hopefully let it stay cooler without a lot of noise from the Claw's dual cooling fans inside.\nThe 7-inch display pumps out full HD resolution with touch input and a game-friendly 120Hz refresh rate. That lower resolution and higher refresh rate makes it ideal for the older or less intense games that these handheld systems seem to be built for.\nOn the back, you'll find a pair of macro buttons that can be programmed for all sorts of custom controls, which is a huge boon for games that may be better played with a keyboard those that leverage complex key binds or command combinations.\nLooking to Last (On a Charge)\nBattery life was a priority for MSI's designers, and the Claw comes outfitted with a 53Wh battery that MSI claims can last two full hours under heavy load. Two hours of handheld PC game time is promising indeed, but we'll need to wait until we can properly test it to see how well MSI's promises hold up in the real world.\nThe device is, at heart, a Windows 11 PC, but most of the time you'll use the included MSI Center M interface, which provides a simplified touch-friendly menu to browse games from your various game libraries. Based on the game store options I saw in the menu, it supports most of the popular options, including Steam and Xbox Game Pass along with publisher stores like Ubisoft, EA, and Epic.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nOn the device, you'll find a Thunderbolt 4 port, MicroSD card slot, and an audio combination headset jack. For secure logins, a fingerprint sensor is built into the power button.\nAnd since the Claw works as a full PC, MSI will also sell a desktop stand that does double duty as a Thunderbolt hub, charging the handheld while also giving you a full-size HDMI port and a pair of USB connections. Because it can run on an external display, you can even set it up with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a full-fledged desktop experience. It can handle productivity and web browsing once made easier with a keyboard and mouse.\nYou'll find a handful of options for the MSI Claw when it launches, with a base model starting at just $699 with an Intel Core Ultra 5 135H CPU and 512GB of SSD storage. A more powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 model will also be available, selling for $749 with 512GB drive or $799 with a 1TB SSD. MSI hasn't announced a firm date for retail availability, but representatives I spoke with say it should land in the coming months.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: Evolution and Revolution\nThough AI was a popular buzzword, faster and better designed products dominated\nCES, the world\u2019s leading trade show, is back! Yes, there were in-person versions of the show in 2022 and 2023, but this year is the first since 2020 that felt \u201cnormal.\u201d The halls were crowded full of eager attendees, the show floors were packed with booths and most of the companies we usually visit with at CES had a presence.\nGoing into the show, we expected to hear the word \u201cAI\u201d every five seconds that we talked with vendors, but in the enthusiast tech world, we heard it a bit less often than our colleagues who cover TVs, appliances and phones at other websites. Instead, it seems that nothing beats good design, more processing power and a positive user experience.\nIntel and the laptop vendors which use its CPUs showed off various local AI workloads, which mostly involved generating images or managing power profiles And AI underpins Nvidia\u2019s gaming technologies. But there are only so many times we can prompt Stable Diffusion\u2019s GIMP plugin to draw a cat driving a car, before we get bored. MSI is the one company that wowed us with a true AI innovation: a monitor that uses computer vision to analyze your game\u2019s map and point out where enemies are coming from.\nInsead, we were excited to see a number of products that really moved the ball forward in ways that were more evolutionary than revolutionary: new graphics cards and CPUs \u00a0that add more performance for the money, a high-end 3D printer that zooms along at 600 mm/s and works with carbon fiber or a gorgeous OLED monitor that can run at up to 480 Hz at 1080p or 240 Hz at 4K.\nThese are the 15 best products of CES 2024.\nBest Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 4070 Super\nNvidia announced three new RTX 40-series Super model graphics cards, and AMD revealed its RX 7600 XT 16GB. While all four will vie for a spot on our list of the best graphics cards for gaming (and other uses), the one we're most excited about is\u2026 well, honestly it's a bit hard to nail things down. Nvidia provides more performance for a lower price than its existing non-Super cards, so things definitely moved in the right direction. AMD provides double the VRAM and slightly higher performance with its new GPU, at a higher price than the RX 7600. But none of the new models are all that surprising \u2014 we've been hearing rumors about both for several months at least. Still, if we have to just pick one for an award, it's the new RTX 4070 Super.\nFundamentally, you're getting about 93% of the RTX 4070 Ti, for 75% of the price. Alternatively, you're getting 22% more GPU than the RTX 4070 for the same price. More importantly, you're at least getting 12GB of high-speed GDDR6X memory, along with access to Nvidia's RTX technologies: DLSS, superior ray tracing, and AI tensor cores. Given the RTX 4070 already trades blows with the RX 7800 XT \u2014 slightly slower rasterization performance, much faster ray tracing and AI performance, and the RTX 4070 Ti does the same with the RX 7900 XT \u2014 Nvidia now effectively delivers a higher performance option at the same price.\nThe RTX 4070 Super launches next week, so check back then for our full review and benchmarks.\nRead more: Nvidia RTX 40-series Super models revealed\n\u2014Jarred Walton\nBest CPU: Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G\nAMD rolled out its Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 lineup of APUs at CES 2024, beating Intel to the punch as the first company to bring purpose-built AI accelerators to the desktop PC -- its second such feat after it was the first to bring AI to laptops with the same XDNA-powered neural processing unit (NPU). The chips also boast a powerful integrated RDNA 3 graphics engine that AMD claims delivers 1080p-capable gaming performance, even in some AAA titles, albeit at the reduced fidelity settings we\u2019d expect from this class of chip.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, AMD builds its APUs for the desktop using the same silicon as its laptop chips. In this case, AMD leverages the Phoenix architecture that employs the Zen 4 CPU architecture and RDNA 3 graphics engine. However, the lack of battery life concerns in desktop PCs allows the chip to run at higher power limits, thus unleashing the full power of the silicon. AMD\u2019s two flagship models, the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G, boast eight and six cores, respectively. AMD also brought its new APU lineup up to modern standards with support for AM5\u2019s DDR5 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, crafting what should be exceptionally powerful processors given their accessible price point.\nAMD\u2019s APUs have historically dominated the entry-level gaming market because Intel doesn\u2019t have processors with powerful enough integrated graphics to provide meaningful gaming performance, even for the lowest-end gaming systems. AMD\u2019s previous-gen Ryzen 5 5600G has long been one of the \u00a0Best CPUs for gaming \u00a0due to its surprisingly strong graphics performance, and we expect the new models to assume that mantle once again.\nThe chips feature FSR, HYPR-RX, and Fluid Motion Frames support, competitive pricing, and bundled coolers for all three SKUs. The new Ryzen APU models are poised to dominate the entry-level gaming segment once again when they arrive on January 31, winning our pick for the best CPU of CES 2024.\nRead more: AMD launches Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 APUs, brings AI to the desktop PC\n-Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Monitor: Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP\nWhen it comes to the best gaming monitors, you often must make some hard choices regarding performance and maximum image quality. You can go with an IPS panel and get ultra-fast 500 Hz refresh rates but compromise on contrast and color. Or you can opt for an OLED panel, which offers vibrant colors and inky blacks but falls short of class-leading refresh rate performance.\nFortunately, Asus is coming to the rescue with its ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP gaming monitor, hoping to give gamers the best of both worlds. In its standard operating mode, the PG32UCDP seems like any other modern high-end 32-inch gaming monitor with a brilliant OLED panel, a 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a fast 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. There\u2019s enough resolution for productivity tasks when not gaming and plenty of performance overhead for 4K gaming with the best graphics cards.\nHowever, the real spicy action happens when you switch to Frame Rate Boost mode. Gamers can quickly toggle this setting on the monitor, which drops the resolution down to Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and boosts the maximum refresh rate to 480 Hz. That next-level speed and performance put it on even footing with the Alienware AW2524H and AW2524HF, which have a native refresh rate of 480 Hz at Full HD resolution. However, those fraternal Alienware twins can hit 500Hz with an overlock setting in the OSD.\nStill, the ability for gamers to pick and choose when they want maximum resolution or maximum performance, all while maintaining the image quality advantages of OLED, must be commended. Asus also gets the basics right, with HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectivity, 90-watt USB-C Power Delivery, and an integrated KVM switch.\nWe\u2019ll be curious to see how the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP performs once we get it in the lab.\nRead more: Asus announces two new OLED gaming monitors delivering 480 Hz at up to 1440p resolution\n--Brandon Hill\nBest Memory: Micron LPCAMM2\nMicron unveiled its new LPCAMM2 memory modules at CES 2024. Despite earlier announcements from competing companies, Micron will be the first to actually bring memory modules based on the new standard to market. Perhaps more important for those looking for the ultimate in performance, these new modules unlock speeds of 9,600 MT/s via LPDDR5X memory, a massive increase over the standard SODIMM peak of DDR5-6400. However, that\u2019s just one of the many advantages of this new memory form factor that will become common in performance-oriented laptops over the coming years.\nThe LPCAMM2 standard also promises to bring fast and power-efficient LPDDR5X memory to laptops in a removable form factor for the first time, meaning the memory chips are no longer required to be soldered directly to the motherboard. These new modules will replace the standard SODIMMs that dominate current laptops, but the innovative design consumes 80% less power and 64% less space inside the chassis, thus enabling longer battery life and even slimmer laptop designs. LPCAMM2 also provides a dual-channel memory interface from a single module, a first. The modules will come in 16, 32, and 64GB capacities at first, with room to grow up to 128GB of capacity in a single module in the future.\nThe power and space savings, not to mention the speed improvements, of Micron\u2019s LPCAMM2 are set to redefine our expectations for laptop memory, earning our award for the best memory of CES 2024.\nRead more: Micron displays next-gen LPCAMM2 modules for laptops at CES 2024\n\u2013Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14/G16\nAsus took classic, beloved laptops known for performance, portability, and even battery life, and made them sleeker than ever. The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are slimmer and have newer, more adult designs than before, and, well, it looks great. There's only so much you can do without a new GPU to push forward graphics, so Asus dug into the design.\nFor the G14, that does mean topping out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, while the G16 uses up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and RTX 4090. Both have silver and black options with a stripe on the lid, rather than a garish massive ROG logo or AniMe Matrix. I'm not going to say it looks like it could double as a business laptop, but it's far more attractive.\nThey're also getting, on paper, really nice screens, with Asus' OLED Nebula displays. The 14-incher gets a 2880 x 1800 screen at 120 Hz, while the bigger 16-inch laptop goes to 2560 x 1600 at 240 Hz. In a brief trial, both looked great, and we're excited to see just how well they perform in real testing.\nRead more: Asus ROG Zephyrus gets a sleek, slim new look with AMD Hawk Point and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Laptop: Asus Zenbook Duo\nThis was a contentious category among the Tom's Hardware judges, with some favoring the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1's even approach to a refresh without reinventing the wheel, while others like the very-CES approach of the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid and its ability to run both Windows and Android with a tablet and base station. But the Asus Zenbook Duo kept coming up as an option that seemed like a refined idea at a price point that's not crazy.\nThe Zenbook Duo has a pair of 14-inch OLED displays and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. It's an idea we first saw hit production in Lenovo's Yoga Book 9i, but that one had a U-series CPU and an origami kickstand that wasn't intuitive. Asus' Zenbook Duo's kickstand is permanently attached to the laptop, and it goes up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. So it should be easier to use and more powerful. The Asus model has far more ports than the Yoga, including HDMI alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWhile we don't have a final price for it, it's been suggested to us that it will hover around $1,500. If that sticks, it won't be a ridiculous price, considering the Yoga was almost $2,000 when we reviewed it.\nI did have a bit of trouble getting the early unit at Asus' briefing to stand up straight with the monitors side to side, but otherwise it seemed like a solid machine, and we're eager to see what it can do.\nRead more: Asus Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen foldable with two 14-inch OLED screens and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Gaming Handheld: MSI Claw\nOne way to make a splash at CES is to be the first to do something. And while the MSI Claw isn't the first modern handheld gaming PC, it is the first mainstream PC brand to use Intel Core Ultra processors (or Intel at all. Lenovo, Asus, and Valve all opted for AMD chips). It's also packing a bigger battery than other handhelds, even if MSI isn't exactly claiming record-breaking battery life.\nMSi is claiming that it's producing a more ergonomic device, and while the plastic did divide some of our editors on the show floor, we're looking forward to trying it in long-term use. The screen seems similar to the one on the Asus ROG Ally, but considering that was a pretty decent screen, it's hard to argue with.\nIntel improving in graphics means we get more competition in handheld gaming outside of the Kickstarter space. We're looking forward to seeing how Intel and MSI put their own mark on it with MSI Center M, XeSS, and other technologies.\nRead more: MSI Claw is the first gaming handheld to run on an Intel Core Ultra processor with Arc Graphics\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Cooling / DIY: Hyte Nexus Link\nIt\u2019s not easy to get excited about an ecosystem at a show like CES, but Hyte\u2019s Nexus Link was a standout for me.This cable-decluttering and system-building simplification platform is clearly a competitor to Corsair's iCue Link, with similar daisy-chained magnetic connectors and fans. But Hyte also offers magnetic RGB strips that use the same connector, and the products have a quirky but much more interesting design.\nNexus Link is powered by a quad-core Arm CPU housed in the screen built into the company\u2019s Thicc Q60 AIO cooler, which we first saw at Computex last year. It sports a thick 240mm radiator and chunky fans that the company claims will outperform any 360mm radiator currently on the market. So the importance of performance isn\u2019t getting left behind in the quest for clean design.\nIn my brief hands-on time with it, the whole Nexus Link ecosystem, from the hardware to the software, felt more refined, definitely more visually interesting, and arguably better built than what Corsair has done with iCue Link. That's a little shocking from a company so comparatively new and unknown.\nI will wait for the chance to build a Nexus Link system and spend some time with the software before I can say for sure how it compares to the competition from Corsair and Lian Li, and others. But on first impression, Hyte looks to be on the verge of pulling off a major upset in the DIY PC space.\nRead more: Hyte's Nexus Link ecosystem of RGB devices makes building rainbow PCs seem easier than ever\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest PC Case: MSI MEG Maestro 700L PG\nWe saw quite a few PC cases designed to support motherboards with rear-facing connectors here at CES 2024, and MSI\u2019s Project Zero boards are some of the first to market using Maingear\u2019s patent. But most are fairly compact, and don\u2019t support full-size ATX options. MSI\u2019s large MEG Maestro 700L PG, though, supports up to E-ATX boards \u2013 like most of these cases, it will work with traditional motherboards as well). But the 700L PG takes the en vogue \u201cfishbowl\u201d case style to the next level, with the entire front and side panel made up of one massive curved piece of tempered glass.\nThe rest of the case is crafted from large panels of 2.5 mm-thick aluminum, and the dual-panel design hides the PSU behind the motherboard, along with all the wires and connectors. Don\u2019t worry about airflow, because fans or large radiators can be mounted in front of the motherboard, as well as on the top or bottom of the case.\nAs you might expect, this will be an expensive case, with an MSI rep telling us that it will cost around $400 when it arrives sometime in the next month or so. It\u2019s far from cheap, but if you crave that clean interior look with acres of glass to show off your GPU and other components, MSI\u2019s MEG Maestro 700L PG is arguably the prettiest of these kinds of cases we\u2019ve seen yet. But at the same time, just looking at that large bent piece of glass makes us more than a little nervous.\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest Mouse: Mad Catz MMO 7+\nIt's been a while since we've seen Mad Catz \u2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and then quietly revived under new ownership in 2018, but it hasn't exactly been making waves. But the brand is back at CES this year with a slew of gaming peripherals, including a new wireless version of an old classic: the MMO 7.\nThe new MMO 7+ is a wireless version of Mad Catz' classic MMO-focused multi-button mouse, with some improvements that bring it into 2024. It features a whopping 21 programmable buttons with a shift mode and five profiles for up to 210 inputs (okay, that's a little ambitious \u2014 but still, 21 buttons is pretty impressive). What's nice is that those 21 buttons are not just laid out in a 12-button side panel like most MMO mice have (see: Razer's Naga V2 Pro, Corsair's Scimitar Elite Wireless, etc), but are kind of... all over the mouse, which makes them easier to differentiate. Like the old MMO 7, it's modular and will come packaged with interchangeable palm rests and pinky rests, as well as a tool that will let you change the palm and thumb rest positions.\nAside from wireless connectivity (2.4GHz and Bluetooth) and a USB-C charging port, the MMO 7+ also features a Pixart PAW-3395 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 26,000DPI, a maximum speed of 650 IPS, and up to 50 G's of acceleration, as well as customizable RGB lighting and a horizontal scroll wheel. The only real disappointment is battery life, which is currently rated at 40 hours \u2014 most gaming mice these days are hitting 75 - 120 hours, so that's a pretty big difference. Still, it's nice to see a mouse that's not just a stripped-down, ultra-lightweight, FPS-oriented pointer with the promise of unnecessarily high polling rates.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Keyboard: Cooler Master MK770\nWe've seen a lot of keyboards at CES 2024, and we actually saw this keyboard \u2014 or, well, the prototype of it \u2014 at CES 2023. But while we've seen a lot of gaming companies making keyboards to appeal to both gamers and keyboard enthusiasts, we haven't seen a lot of them also taking budget into account. Cooler Master's MK770 has all the premium features we've been looking for \u2014 gasket-mounted, hot-swappable, wireless with tri-mode connectivity, double-shot PBT keycaps, and more than one colorway \u2014 and it's set to cost just $119 when it launches this year.\nThe MK770 is also a 96-percent keyboard, meaning it's practically full-sized (minus some navigation keys) while still being relatively compact (or, well, as compact as you can get without sacrificing your number pad). It features a solid-feeling chassis with two sets of flip-out feet on the bottom \u2014 and cleverly-placed dongle storage under one of the flip-out feet, and has a programmable clickable volume knob. It's not the most feature-rich keyboard, but it's got everything you need for wireless gaming and it's hot-swappable.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Innovation: MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED\nBigger, faster, more colorful. Those are three aspects that we typically track when new monitors are announced. For example, ASRock is making waves with its new 27-inch 520Hz gaming monitor, and vibrant OLED monitors are becoming more commonplace. But what if a company could make a monitor smarter? That's not something we'd thought about until now, with the introduction of the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED and its onboard AI acceleratoOne feature of the AI hardware, dubbed SkySight, can automatically pinpoint and mark enemies on the screen in games like League of Legends. Instantly knowing what direction your enemies are coming from \u00a0is a definite perk, even if you could do the tracking with your own eyes.\nAll the AI processing is performed onboard the monitor and is undetectable since there is no intervention from your operating system or other installed software. We could see this being frowned upon by competitive gamers as an unfair advantage, but the underlying technology that frames SkySight is intriguing.\nThe MEG 321URX even features what MSI calls a Spectrum Bar (basically, a thin RGB strip) that sits below the display. Once again, using League of Legends as an example, the Spectrum Bar can light up to mirror your character's current health status. Even though League of Legends was the primary focus of MSI's CES demos, the company plans to release software for training to detect on-screen items for just about any game. It would be cool to see the Spectrum Bar used to mimic shift lights that you would see on a steering wheel on an F1 driver's steering wheel in games like EA's F1 23.\nLooking past the AI intrigue, the MEG 321URX's specs sheet is impressive in its own right, with a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel. The monitor can even achieve 240Hz at that native resolution with a 0.03ms response time. It also features a USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 support.\nKeep an eye out for the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED when it debuts this spring.\nRead more: MSI's AI-powered gaming monitor helps you cheat at 'League of Legends,' looks great doing it\n--Brandon Hill\nBest 3D Printer: Creality K1C\nCreality\u2019s flagship K1 printer was already excellent, providing high-quality output at speeds as high as 600 mm/s. However, the K1 isn\u2019t perfect and there are a few things that Creality fans had wanted from it, including the ability to sustain higher temperatures and work with more exotic filaments.\nEnter the Creality K1C, which takes everything we like about the K1 and builds upon it. The new printer features an all-metal hotend which allows it to operate at a steady 300 degrees and therefore work with carbon fiber (that\u2019s what the C in K1C is for). The printer also has a revised bowden tube path, better build plate and other improvements we don\u2019t know about yet (the company has not released full specs). One of the leading 3D printer companies has a new leading device.\nRead more: Creality unveils new flagship K1C 3D printer and latest Ender 3 V3 model\n\u2013 Avram Piltch\nBest SSD: Phison PCIe 5.0 powered drives and controllers\nPhison previewed its E26 Max14um firmware prior to CES, and we saw multiple drives that should soon hit retail with performance of up to 14 GB/s. The key to enablement of the Micron 2400 MT/s NAND involved firmware updates and tuning to keep the controller within the PCIe M.2 power limit. Which brings us to the second part of this award.\nThe Phison E26 controller has been powering the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives of the past year, but the real innovation is set to arrive with the next generation E31 controller that will launch later this year. E26 is manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, and the E31 will move to TSMC 7nm (N7). At that point, the combination of NAND and controller should effectively max out what we can expect to see from PCIe 5.0 drives \u2014 we'll need PCIe 6.0 to get significantly faster.\nPut another way, Phison is moving the entire high-performance consumer SSD market forward. Without Phison, we'd still be stuck with PCIe 4.0 drives for at least a few more months. We've had PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots on Z690 motherboards since 2021 and had to wait two years to get SSDs that would make use of the technology, and we have Phison to thank for that.\n\u2013 Jarred Walton\nBest Motherboard: ASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi\nASRock already owns most of the slots on our Best Motherboards page for current-gen chipsets, because the company has recently been delivering solid feature sets at comparatively low prices, while the rest of the industry seems content to churn out ever-more-expensive boards for the kinds of builders who still have $1,000 or more left over after buying the shiny new RTX 4080 Super.\nAnd the new Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi, at just $200, looks to continue that trend for those looking to build a compact but powerful Mini-ITX with up to an Intel 14900K, thanks to 14+1+1 power phase setup, adorned with some chunky heatsinks.\nThe dual-DIMM setup that\u2019s typical of ITX boards should also make for top-speed RAM support. The only limiting factor here is that the board seems to only have a single PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot, although there could be another hiding on the back of the board. We hope to get this board in soon and run it through our benchmark suite. If it performs as expected, this will likely be an appealing motherboard for many gamers looking to build a powerful compact rig while spending most of their build budget on things like the GPU and CPU.\nRead More: ASRock's $200 Mini-ITX motherboard to support Intel Core i9-14900K\n\u2013 Matt Safford\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

        "raw_content": "Home > Articles > Features\nCES 2024 Award-Winning Laptop: The MSI Titan 18 HX\nIt\u2019s a new year, and the new award-winning MSI Titan 18 HX was on full display at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. The annual Consumer and Electronics Show once again took over Las Vegas, with a plethora of different brands and industries showcasing their latest technologies and products. The MSI Titan 18 HX gaming laptop is no different. With some amazing features like a per-key RGB Cherry mechanical switch keyboard, NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 4090, a world-first display and more, the Titan 18 HX is a fantastic choice for your next gaming laptop.\nWinner of the CES 2024 Innovation Awards for both the Gaming & eSports and Artificial Intelligence (AI) categories, the MSI Titan 18 HX is a force to be reckoned with. Looking at the laptop, it is easy to see what is so exciting about this gaming powerhouse. It has a massive 18-inch screen squeezed into a 17-inch chassis. The larger chassis is also made of an Al-Mg alloy, which allows for an optimal cooling environment and makes it sturdy, durable, lightweight and portable.\nCheck out the 2024 Titan 18 HX FROM @MSI at CES2024, winning both the CES Innovation 2024 award for Gaming and eSports AND AI! #CES #CES2024 #MSI @MSI Gaming Canada\nThe huge 18-inch screen is also the world\u2019s first 18\u2033 4K Mini LED 120hz display. Featuring 1000-nits brightness and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, the Titan 18 HX\u2019s display allows for incredible realism in all environments, like indoors, outdoors, and even in direct sunlight. Rounding out the display is a 120hz refresh rate, making it an ideal gaming companion, hence the CES 2024 Innovation Award for Gaming & eSports.\nIn terms of memory, the Titan 18 HX comes outfitted with 4 sets of expansion memory slots that utilize 4x DDR5 memory, allowing you to attain as much as 128 GB of memory and a possible 6.4 Gbps transfer speed! With 3x M.2 SSD slots, the Titan 18 HX can reach incredibly high speeds and up to 8 TB of storage space.\n\u201c\u2026the Titan 18 HX\u2019s display allows for incredible realism in all environments like indoors, outdoors, and even in direct sunlight.\u201d\nThe Titan 18 HX sports 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports, 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, 1 SD card slot, 1 Audio jack, a Kensington lock slot, an HDMI 2.1 port, as well as a DC jack, and an RJ45 port for Ethernet. For those of us who want to connect wirelessly, it also features an Intel Killer Wi-Fi 7 card that allows for speeds of up to 5.8 Gbps, ensuring you are always in the game with the lowest latency possible.\nLike the Titan GT77, the Titan 18 HX has a SteelSeries keyboard with Cherry Mx Mechanical RGB keys per key and a 65% larger number pad and arrow keys. They felt and sounded fantastic, especially considering this is a laptop. It is crazy to think how much innovation has gone into something like this, but MSI has delivered. While it may sound minor, even the touchpad helps to give a sense of the innovation at play within the Titan 18 HX. The touchpad is a seamless, RGB-integrated experience with haptic navigation to boot. Not only does it make navigation easier, but it is also more responsive thanks to the haptics it incorporates.\nThis laptop has been plucked right from the top of the line, and the specs show it. With up to an NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 4090 and an Intel i9-14900HX processor, there\u2019s not much the Titan 18 HX can\u2019t handle, whether it\u2019s video editing, Photoshop, or playing Cyberpunk 2077 at max resolution.\n\u201cThe Titan 18 HX aims to be MSI\u2019s most powerful laptop yet\u2026\u201d\nTo keep this gaming monster cool, MSI has used the revolutionary Vapor Chamber Cooling, which is designed to keep things cool even under load. 2 fans and 4 separate vents allow for maximum airflow and cooling to ensure the computer doesn\u2019t overheat even under the most intense use. Combine this with MSI\u2019s brilliant work with temperature performance management, and you have a machine that stays cool under pressure.\nWe now arrive at the coolest part of the Titan 18 HX, and that is the MSI AI Engine. This exclusive technology helped MSI receive a CES 2024 Innovation Award for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is on full display here. With a simple toggling of a button, the AI Engine will automatically start learning user preferences for a broad range of things like brightness, audio, and visual, as well as gaming preferences like optimal settings when playing something like Forza Motorsport or Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. It\u2019s not limited to gaming either, as there are a massive amount of applications that the AI Engine can be used for, such as Zoom calls, Adobe Creative Cloud, YouTube, and more.\nThe AI Engine also gives the user control over which settings are affected when the button is turned on. For example, if you want the AI Engine not to dim the screen when the environment is dark or increase or decrease the volume, you can disable that part of the data collection.\nUsers can also provide feedback directly to MSI through the MSI Center application to assist with ensuring that the deep learning that the AI Engine is doing is done correctly with the most relevance and context to the user experience.\nThe Titan 18 HX aims to be MSI\u2019s most powerful laptop yet, and with things like the AI Engine, the incredible 4K 120hz display, as well as the ability to utilize ray-tracing in some of the most graphically intense titles, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Forza Motorsport speaks volumes about just how incredible this machine is. Then, when you take into account the fact that this is a portable device and not a stationary desktop computer, it becomes all the more impressive.\nBuyers can find the MSI Titan 18 HX available at authorized retailers.\nThe story above is sponsored and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of CGMagazine or its staff.\nThis post may contain affiliate links.
