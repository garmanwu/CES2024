The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) has announced that Aurora Labs has been named a CES 2024 Innovation Awards honoree for Auto Update in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) category.\nThe CES Innovation Awards program received a record number of over 3,000 submissions. The announcement was made ahead of CES 2024, the world\u2019s most powerful technology event, happening Jan. 9-12 in Las Vegas, USA.\nThe CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is an annual competition honouring outstanding design and engineering in 29 consumer technology product categories. Those with the highest rating receive the \u201eBest of Innovation\u201c distinction. An elite panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers, engineers and more, reviewed submissions based on innovation, engineering and functionality, aesthetics and design.\nOTA (Over-The-Air) updates enable car manufacturers to fix inevitable bugs in new software code, protect against security vulnerabilities, and offer ongoing feature improvements. As OTA updates become a frequent occurrence, a new approach is required that will reduce costs, reduce vehicle downtime and improve availability. Aurora Labs\u2018 Auto Update uses AI to identify changes in the vehicle source code and integrate into the software developer\u2019s toolchain to enable six times smaller update files than current OTA solutions, a 50% saving in hardware memory requirements and seamless in-vehicle updates with zero downtime for the user.\nZohar Fox, CEO and Co-founder of Aurora Labs commented: \u201eI am thrilled and proud of this great achievement. Receiving the CES Innovation Award Honoree for 2024 for Auto Update is once again a testament to Aurora Labs\u201c continuous commitment to bring actionable innovation to the automotive industry. This recognition follows our previous Innovation Award at CES 2021 and fuels our passion to continue redefining the future of mobility to be safer and more accessible.\nAuto Update offers these unique advantages:\nMore information on Auto Update is available here: https://www.auroralabs.com/product/auto-update/\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards honorees can be found at CES.tech/innovation.\nTo schedule a meeting with Aurora Labs\u2018 executives to learn more, please send a note to info@auroralabs.com\n\u0394\nVerwandter Inhalt\nAurora Labs Prioritizes Automotive SPICE Compliance to Create a Culture of Quality\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of automotive software, balancing innovation with industry standards is...\nDie versteckten Kosten und Herausforderungen der Softwareintegration, -zertifizierung und -wartung f\u00fcr Kfz-Steuerger\u00e4te\nIn der Automobilindustrie haben sich elektronische Steuerger\u00e4te (ECUs) zu komplexen Systemen entwickelt, die stark...\nDie Zukunft der Automobilsoftware\nSeit nun mehr als 40 Jahren werden, elektronische Steuerger\u00e4te in Fahrzeugen verwendet.

Auto Update\u2019s 3-Diff technology is integrated into the development toolchain, analyzing changes in the source code and automatically creating additive update files in the same file format as the original embedded ECU file (ELF, S-Rec, Intel HEX). These files are fully executable and do not need a proprietary update agent to be integrated into each and every ECU.\nUsing standard file formats removes the burden of adapting the testing systems, security protocols, production systems and dealership maintenance systems. Auto Update can reduce the size of an update file for a large ECU from 500 MB to only 15MB (97%). This reduction in size has direct effects on SBOM, data transmission and cloud storage costs.\nAuto update patented 3-Diff additive update files do not interfere with the execution of the existing software, enabling the update to be installed without reflashing or reprograming, with no reliance on an active connection, and with zero downtime, with or without A/B memory. Up to 20 updates can be written to the existing flash memory without requiring a single erase, prolonging the life of the flash memory by 40x.\nAuto Update utilizes the vehicle\u2019s power to execute the write, without discharging the battery, removing any unnecessary battery drainage and maintaining a healthy battery lifespan. The small nature of the update file allows for multiple update versions to be written over time on the same flash memory, enabling for instant roll-back, without reprogramming, to any version in case of an error, security incident or recall \u2013 thus maintaining a full fail-safe redundancy solution.\nFor more information, visit: https://www.auroralabs.com/product/auto-update/\nMore from Embedded Computing\nTrending Articles\nJanuary 19, 2024\nJanuary 19, 2024\nJanuary 18, 2024\nJanuary 18, 2024\nJanuary 16, 2024\nJanuary 24, 2024\nJanuary 09, 2024\nJanuary 08, 2024\nJanuary 03, 2024\nJanuary 02, 2024\nJanuary 22, 2024\nDecember 27, 2023\nDecember 20, 2023\nDecember 11, 2023\nNovember 20, 2023\nJanuary 23, 2024\nJanuary 22, 2024\nJanuary 19, 2024\nJanuary 18, 2024\nJanuary 18, 2024\nJanuary 23, 2024\nJanuary 23, 2024\nJanuary 02, 2024\nDecember 20, 2023\nDecember 14, 2023\n\u00a92024 OpenSystems Media"
