        "raw_content": "Main Navigation\nCES 2024: Innovations in the medical device industry\nCES 2024 is just weeks away and we\u2019re counting down the days till we can share and discover the latest innovations and advancements in tech across industries. This year\u2019s theme is Human Security for All, which emphasizes the critical role technology plays in making the world safer and more sustainable for everyone, encompassing topics from environmental protection to healthcare access and food security. With keynote conversations featuring leaders in technology, consumer goods and healthcare spaces, CES 2024 invites us to consider how we can come together to engineer solutions that solve global human security issues.\nIn the opening keynote, Siemens AG CEO Dr. Roland Busch will kick off these conversations by revealing how combining the real and digital worlds empowers manufacturers everywhere to transform the everyday, for everyone. Throughout the four-day event, we\u2019ll dive into the various ways that Siemens technology is helping our customers make the world more accessible for all, with one of the key areas being the medical device industry. Read on for a sneak peak of what awaits at CES and discover more ways that Siemens digital solutions are reshaping the medical device and healthcare industries.\nUnlimited Tomorrow: Breaking barriers in access to prosthetics\nOur booth at CES will highlight multiple customer success stories from across industries. One story we\u2019re excited to share comes from Unlimited Tomorrow, a manufacturer of personalized, affordable prosthetic arms.\nThe traditional process of creating prosthetic limbs is costly and can take up to a year. For users who are children and may still be growing, this process can leave them with a prosthetic that no longer fits at the time of delivery. Using Siemens NX software, Unlimited Tomorrow is able to drastically shorten the time it takes to create a prosthetic. Unlimited Tomorrow makes it easy for users to order a prosthetic from the comfort of their home using a scan app on a mobile device. Once the scans are received, Unlimited Tomorrow designs a man/machine \u201csocket\u201d to fit the prosthetic to the patient\u2019s partial arm, 3D prints the prosthetic and ships it to the customer. They typically receive their lightweight prosthetic arm five times faster than the traditional process.\nHow additive manufacturing is reshaping the medical device industry\nUnlimited Tomorrow isn\u2019t the only example of how additive manufacturing can be used to transform the medical device industry and elevate patient care with high-quality, durable products. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to easily develop custom prosthetics, implants and orthopedic surgical guides that are as unique as the patients they serve.\nSimilar to the process of producing prosthetics, custom orthopedic surgical guides can also be created from patient scans and developed individually. Surgical cutting guides are used to limit cuts to a specific area, allowing surgeons to make precise cuts when removing a diseased or injured area of a bone before inserting a replacement. Traditionally, surgeons would use patient scans to determine the position and location of the cuts, then estimate what size of cutting guide is necessary. During the operation, they would then make the final decision about the size and position of the guide, selecting from a collection of generic sizes.\nWith additive manufacturing and modern design software, surgeons can use the same patient scan data to mold the cutting guide\u00a0to the shape of the patient\u2019s bone and virtually place it in the exact position necessary to make the most precise cut. The end result? Less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times for patients.\nAdditive manufacturing is also broadening the types of implant materials available. Traditional implants used in procedures such as knee replacements are bonded to the bone using a cement adhesive. This adhesive will gradually weaken over time, often leading to an implant replacement later down the line. Several companies are now using metal-based lattice structures to promote bone growth into knee, hip and shoulder replacements.\u00a0Lattice structures are three-dimensional arrangements of a material at a small scale. They form a scaffold-type structure that is lightweight yet strong. Medical companies including LimaCorporate have designed lattice structures that can integrate directly with new bone growth when used as implants. Unlike cement, this bond actually grows stronger over time, leading to long-term durability.\nEnhancing digital health security\nMedical devices are becoming a daily part of our lives, whether it\u2019s a patient using a device that connects to their cell phone to help manage a chronic condition, or healthcare professionals managing healthcare workflows. These devices make our lives easier and more connected, but they collect sensitive information that must be handled carefully. In order to protect patient safety and confidentiality, it\u2019s imperative that medical devices are secured against bugs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nSiemens Connected Care solutions equip medical device manufacturers with tools to improve the safety, quality and performance of their products. With our low-code application development platform, Mendix, and a robust cybersecurity framework, manufacturers can work collaboratively to build devices that enhance user experience and create apps for all forms of interaction \u2013 handheld to augmented reality. For the best user experience, our solutions improve device functionality and future-proof the software to ensure smooth upgrades.\nVisit Siemens at CES\nAre you attending CES 2024?

Research suggests that 30% of the global population have sleeping disorders. People with the condition face a 6 times higher risk of experiencing a wake-up stroke and an 11-times higher risk of traffic accidents, while bearing higher risks of coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, and other diseases. Above all, people with OSA increase social healthcare costs and burdens. However, 90% of OSA goes undiagnosed or untreated. In fact, the costs of treating OSA could be as much as $10 billion per year.\nTraditional tests for OSA diagnosis have multiple disadvantages. Limited medical resources mean that there is typically a significantly long wait time to make an appointment for testing. The test requires the testee to wear multiple sensing devices with detection circuits in a hospital lab. These uncomfortable devices and the unfamiliar sleep environment could negatively affect quality of sleep and lead to inaccurate test results. In-hospital tests require not only space, time, and resources but also professional medical operators. All of these limitations have led to a low testing rate for OSA worldwide.\nBuilding innovative wearable medical monitors with cutting edge technology and exclusive AI algorithms\nTo resolve the negative effects of OSA, Singular Wings took on the challenge of developing a simple approach to OSA diagnosis. This young startup developed an OSA diagnosis patch that is about the size of a Band-Aid. Instead of going to a hospital lab for a sophisticated \"Sleep Multiple Physiological Examination,\" users are able to perform a self-examination at home using the diagnosis patch. Using the patch takes less time than the full lab testing process and allows the user to maintaining a normal sleeping routine, helping ensure the accuracy of test results. The device continuously monitors multiple vital signs, including heart rate, ECG, temperature, position, and breathing rate and pattern. Using data collected during sleep, the results pin-point abnormal breathing periods during sleep.\nSingular Wings' core technology is a high-sensitivity physiological sign sensor, with circuit design and wiring optimized for minimal size and profile. A cloud algorithm platform provides software updates, does regular operation maintenance, and organizes the performance status to maintain monitoring quality. The collected data are sent to authorized mobile devices via Bluetooth connectivity, allowing wearer health conditions to be monitored in a timely manner. The wearable design affixes reliably to skin surfaces and is easily detached for recharge. The device complies with AASM standards and is NCC and FCC certified.\nForeseeing an even better solution in the era of 5G\nEstablished in 2015, Singular Wings specializes in wearable health monitors. Their unique take on product development has received numerous international awards. The company continues to press the envelop of innovation, collaborating with Asia Pacific Telecom's \"5G smart medical device\" program to implement 5G data on their AI-wearable health monitor device \u2013 the BEATINFO heart disease recorder.\nTaking part in the Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) program, Singular Wings was selected as one of the 100 featured Taiwanese startups showcased at CES 2021 and was honored with the Excellency Award for Mitigating COVID-19 at AABI 2020. Singular Wings continues to innovate in the realm of medical monitoring devices, making healthcare management more accessible and understandable for the public at large.\nCES 2021 TTA-VR Pavilion: https://pse.is/3bvlc5\nSOURCE Singular Wings\nModal title\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"

(Intuitive Surgical) is the global leader in the emerging field of robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Intuitive Surgical\u2019s da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System consists of a patient-side cart which includes the robotic arms, a surgeon\u2019s console with 3D HD visualization, and various EndoWrist\u00ae instruments used for the specific procedures.\nThe system translates the surgeon\u2019s natural hand movements at instrument controls on the surgeon\u2019s console into precise, corresponding movements by the robotic arms.\nThe company has seen double-digit growth since the da Vinci Surgical System was introduced and by 2009, there are over 1,200 systems in hospitals and academic institutions worldwide. The corporate headquarters is in Sunnyvale, California and over 1100 employees and annual sales of over $600 million (USD). Intuitive Surgical was the MD&DI Manufacturer of the year in 2007.\nCompany history\n1995 \u2014 Intuitive Surgical founded by Rob Young and Dr. Fred Moll\n1997 \u2014 Went public, secured main round of funding, and started\ndevelopment of da Vinci Surgical System\n1999 \u2014 1st Generation da Vinci Surgical System receives CE\u00a0Marking for Europe through UL Notified Body (NB) partnership\n2000 \u2014 FDA Clearance granted on da Vinci Surgical System\n2003 \u2014 1st major upgrade \u2014 Added optional 4th arm\n2006 \u2014 Released da Vinci\u00ae STM model \u2014 Major redesign of\u00a0patient side cart, manipulators, and instruments\n2009 \u2014 Released da Vinci\u00ae STM \u2014 Second major redesign added\u00a0Enhanced 3D HD resolution, updated and simplified user interface,\u00a0upgradeable architecture and compatibility with existing OR suite\u00a0technology, optional dual console and new ergonomic settings on\nthe surgeon console.\nWhy Intuitive Surgical chooses UL\n\u2022 State-of-the-Art certification knowledge\n\u2022 Consistent interpretations\n\u2022 CB Reports accepted worldwide\n\u2022 High Integrity Certification Marks\n\u2022 Prestige associated with certification by UL and the UL Mark\nNew design highlights need for specialized\u00a0compliance knowledge\nSince its inception, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISI) has chosen UL as its certification provider. As is typical in the industry, ISI often brought UL in to provide the certification assessment after the product design was complete. When quick questions came up early in development phase, the ISI team would contact\u00a0the local UL engineering office to see if they could get a quick response. And when those questions would require significant engineering effort, the ISI team would open a preliminary review project.\nOpening a formal preliminary review project for each design question often presented challenges because\u00a0typically, the product was not in a final state of design and may not even have had a formal name. Overall, the established way Intuitive Surgical received certification information did not meet their business needs.\nFor a major new product design project like the da Vinci Si Surgical System, Mike Yramategui, Principal Regulatory Engineer, knew he needed certification input early in the design process and the availability of UL expertise for consistent interpretation of the requirements of UL / IEC 60601-1.\nWorking with his UL Account Executive, UL and Mr. Yramategui agreed on a custom contract covering the anticipated scope of work over the new product development timeline. This contract\u2019s scope of services was divided into line items that included a provision for a Dedicated Customer Resource who would hold \u2018office hours\u2019 at the Intuitive Surgical facility at regular intervals throughout the year to answer questions related to standards interpretations at ongoing intervals throughout the design process. Due to the innovative nature of the design, the contract\u00a0also designated a number of additional hours for engineering time to be conducted outside of office hours.\nDedicated customer resource \u2014 process\nThe UL engineer assigned as the Dedicated Customer Resource for Intuitive Surgical Inc. was Staff Engineer, Denise Klinker. The Dedicated Customer Resource provides ongoing service by allocating time for the UL engineer to discuss the standard requirements and their intent. Initially, the Dedicated Customer Resource was introduced to the product and technology and held office hours at the ISI location where the engineers could approach her with questions on standards interpretations, no matter how far along in the process. By getting involved at the beginning of the project, it allowed ISI to make decisions early enough so as not to impact the schedule and design. \u201cBy bringing UL in early design stage of product development, this meant they\u00a0were incorporating safety requirements as design inputs, rather than potential redesign late in the process,\u201d said Denise Klinker.\nHaving this UL resource was very helpful in supporting Mr.Yramategui during the early design phases. \u201cUL may think we brought them in too early with preliminary ideas. From a customer standpoint, the fact that UL looked at some of those\nideas early and said \u2019thumbs down\u2019, was very helpful. Internally, being a compliance person, I had cautioned the group that I didn\u2019t think \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019 was going to be acceptable, but it was early enough to say, \u2018let\u2019s bring in the experts\u2019 who are going to make the call. UL came in and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can meet this specific clause (or clauses), but if you can provide a risk based rationale on why it achieves an equivalent level of safety we may be able to accept it.\u2019 They were able to help frame it in a way that the engineers could understand why it didn\u2019t comply and, of course then it had the weight of being the UL interpretation rather than the internal person\u2019s interpretation.\u201d\nISI\u2019s design effort involved a core of 5-6 engineering managers, each leading a team of engineers focused on their part of the project. The Dedicated Customer Resource was available to answer the standards questions these engineers had throughout the design process. \u201cIt was extremely helpful to be\u00a0able to send out notices that we have someone coming from UL,which let our staff know that UL is here for any questions on the standards and how they apply to each design area, whether it be mechanical, electrical, thermal, or whatever. This provided a lot of awareness on the project team, and emphasized that the requirements are not just (standard) numbers that the design will automatically meet but it forces them to say \u201coh what is that?\u2019. It also gave them a convenient way to get information after they realized \u2018I do have a question\u2019 on safety factors, or on temperature limits. A lot of the questions may be easy but it offloads me from having to answer hundreds of emails and allows the principals to discuss the issues face to face. \u201d\nWhen the Intuitive Surgical design team was ready to submit their da Vinci Si Surgical System to UL for certification, Ms.Klinker retained her office hours, and worked with two UL project engineers who were assigned to the project. Two other UL project engineers were assigned to the specific sub-systems and Ms. Klinker\u2019s function as the Dedicated Customer Resource continued as project manager maintaining a consistent level of communication between ISI and UL.\nWe shared a common goal and the goal was to get it done right and get it done on-time. There\u2019s a secondary aspect \u2026 it\u2019s not just schedule. By having that dialogue early, the UL project engineer is a little more comfortable in asking \u201chow does that comply?\u201d because it\u2019s not like at the very end where they don\u2019t want to say anything until it is run through the review chain.\nBy being able to voice their concerns early, on many occasions we might say \u2018oh we can change that, because it\u2019s early in the design phase\u2019. This kind of relationship and communication is important for a safer and better design as well as meeting schedule.\u201d\nCollaboration facilitates technical considerations\nAs expected, during the course of the year, there were some things the UL Dedicated Customer Resource could not answer on her own and she had to work with Intuitive Surgical to understand the situation, and then utilize UL\u2019s network of experts to render an interpretation. This included the PDE, other reviewers, UL\u2019s Software experts, and the project engineers.\nIn one case, working collaboratively with UL, ISI had to do a complete risk assessment to demonstrate that they met the requirements. This documentation had to go to the UL PDE for review. In a less collaborative scenario, this would have caused an unexpected delay. Being engaged early in the process helped eliminate those issues from negatively impacting the schedule and was a positive experience for the UL engineering team as well. \u201cThis process allowed UL to start an early dialogue with the PDE on several constructions\nthat were not meeting the requirements of the standard,but Intuitive Surgical wanted to incorporate in their design by demonstrating equivalency,\u201d said Ms. Klinker. \u201cBased on discussions with the PDE, we were able to provide preliminary comments and concerns that Intuitive Surgical needed to address in their risk analysis. This gave Intuitive Surgical the \u2018head\u2019s up\u2019 on what to expect during the formal investigation if they didn\u2019t want to change their design.\u201d\nProactive review allows for engineering elegant solutions (LEAN Principles)\nThe proactive review component of the Dedicated Customer Resource office hours allows interpretation questions to be answered during the entire design process. By eliminating redesign and rework for compliance issues, it saves the company time and helps to develop a predictable schedule.\n\u201cIn the end, it results in better design solutions for compliance because if you find out late in the process, you are going to Band-aid it. If you find out early in the process, you will engineer an elegant solution around it.\u201d As with the LEAN Engineering Principles, this translates into a business benefit to the bottom line.\n\u201cThe reality of schedules is that they change, they move. This service certainly reduces product and schedule risk,\u201d said Yramategui. \u201cI can\u2019t put a number on that but, as with any development project, your compliance and regulatory activities are dependent on outside agencies so they are somewhat\noutside your control, and this has been able to minimize that exposure. This process allows any sort of potential problem to be seen sooner rather than later.\u201d\nComplex standard requirements drives need for proactive review\nIn Mr. Yramategui\u2019s opinion, proactive review and the Dedicated Customer Resource would be a good service option for even less-complex devices. \u201cThe standard is sufficiently complex that any new product, even if it is fairly simple would benefit\u00a0from this model. In the old model, we would try to submit for preliminary construction review early in the design process, but this (DCR service) was even better than that because to get to prelim, the bar is pretty high \u2014 you need draft labels, prototypes, and sometimes, that may not occur until it\u2019s too late,or you have made a lot of design decisions.\u201d\nWhere proactive review may not work\nThis approach may not necessarily be valuable for design changes where there are typically no interpretation questions, minor construction changes or where the requirements are applied in more of a prescriptive fashion. However, if there is a lack of evidence or precedent that the product revisions\u00a0will meet requirements, it may still be worthwhile to explore preliminary review or testing prior to final sourcing of materials and parts.\nWhy Intuitive Surgical chose a dedicated\u00a0customer resource\n\u2022 The availability of consistent interpretation among multiple design managers working concurrently on separate parts of the device\n\u2022 Predictable availability of a compliance engineer to answer interpretation questions\n\u2022 Dedicated resource available to allocate work\n\u2022 UL Engineers with expertise in medical device\n\u2022 Ability to adjust the schedule through communication and sharing of information\n\u2022 Eliminates the need to open several projects for multiple preliminary reviews to cover all areas of the device\nAbout Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global technology leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery.
