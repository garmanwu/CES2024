The booth, located at 16649 in LVCC Central Hall, will showcase the progress of the most advanced \"PinTILT\u2122\" Augmented Reality (AR) optical solutions and successful commercialization cases with its customers.\nSEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- LetinAR Inc. (CEO Kim Jae-hyeok), a developer of optical solutions for Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses, announced that, at the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, USA, to be held between January 9~12, it will be releasing its \"PinTILT\u2122\" lens, which brings AR optics to the next level and successful commercialization cases with its global customers including Jorjin, Nimo, and others.\nLetinAR PinTILT\u2122 AR Optical System with Glasses\nAs a developer of optical systems for AR smart glasses, LetinAR introduced its PinTILT\u2122 technology at the CES for the last seven consecutive years. LetinAR drew the attention of global companies as it was recognized for having overcome the performance limitations of the existing AR optical system on the back of its unique and practical technology. LetinAR releases its \"FrontiAR\u2122 Pro\" optical system based on PinTILT\u2122 technology at CES 2024, which resolves technological barriers and elevates the optical system to the next level.\nThe strongest feature of the \"FrontiAR\u2122 Pro\" lens is that it overcomes the issue of brightness uniformity, which has been the greatest challenge to existing PinMR\u2122 (\"Pin Mirror\u2122\") AR optical systems. The brightness uniformity, which was previously limited, has been improved, thereby enhancing performance by approximately three times. On top of that, the image quality, an existing strength, has been further improved so that it can be easily worn like regular glasses.\nAt CES 2024, visitors can experience an ultra-high definition, immersive AR demonstration, which is developed based on the PinTILT\u2122 AR optical system. The global customers of LetinAR, mainly Jorjin, a leading XR device manufacturer with more than ten years of experience, introduce J8L Glasses, optimized for spatial experiences based on the LetinAR FrotinAR\u2122 Pro (Formerly B42) optical system. Nimo, the developer of the World's First Spatial Computer for Productivity, launches Nimo One, also equipped with the LetinAR FrotinAR\u2122 Pro optical system. Additionally, more customers of LetinAR from America and Asia will launch their successful productization cases onsite. All visitors are welcome to experience all the glasses.\nThe company and its customers plan to exhibit interactive, responsive content that provides the first-hand experience of immersive spatial content. Users may also test demonstrations in the form of goggles, giving users the experience of wearing helmets such as Ironman's Jarvis or those worn by F-35 fighter plane pilots. By combining the Generative AI function, Nimo is planning to demonstrate Nimo Glasses, Nimo Core, and OS which are designed for Spatial Productivity and fit in our Pocket.

The booth, located at 16649 in LVCC Central Hall, will showcase the progress of the most advanced \u201cPinTILT\u2122\u201d Augmented Reality (AR) optical solutions and successful commercialization cases with its customers.\nSEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 LetinAR Inc. (CEO Kim Jae-hyeok), a developer of optical solutions for Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses, announced that, at the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, USA, to be held between January 9~12, it will be releasing its \u201cPinTILT\u2122\u201d lens, which brings AR optics to the next level and successful commercialization cases with its global customers including Jorjin, Nimo, and others.\nLetinAR PinTILT\u2122 AR Optical System with Glasses\nAs a developer of optical systems for AR smart glasses, LetinAR introduced its PinTILT\u2122 technology at the CES for the last seven consecutive years. LetinAR drew the attention of global companies as it was recognized for having overcome the performance limitations of the existing AR optical system on the back of its unique and practical technology. LetinAR releases its \u201cFrontiAR\u2122 Pro\u201d optical system based on PinTILT\u2122 technology at CES 2024, which resolves technological barriers and elevates the optical system to the next level.\nThe strongest feature of the \u201cFrontiAR\u2122 Pro\u201d lens is that it overcomes the issue of brightness uniformity, which has been the greatest challenge to existing PinMR\u2122 (\u201cPin Mirror\u2122\u201d) AR optical systems. The brightness uniformity, which was previously limited, has been improved, thereby enhancing performance by approximately three times. On top of that, the image quality, an existing strength, has been further improved so that it can be easily worn like regular glasses.\nAt CES 2024, visitors can experience an ultra-high definition, immersive AR demonstration, which is developed based on the PinTILT\u2122 AR optical system. The global customers of LetinAR, mainly Jorjin, a leading XR device manufacturer with more than ten years of experience, introduce J8L Glasses, optimized for spatial experiences based on the LetinAR FrotinAR\u2122 Pro (Formerly B42) optical system. Nimo, the developer of the World\u2019s First Spatial Computer for Productivity, launches Nimo One, also equipped with the LetinAR FrotinAR\u2122 Pro optical system. Additionally, more customers of LetinAR from America and Asia will launch their successful productization cases onsite. All visitors are welcome to experience all the glasses.\nThe company and its customers plan to exhibit interactive, responsive content that provides the first-hand experience of immersive spatial content. Users may also test demonstrations in the form of goggles, giving users the experience of wearing helmets such as Ironman\u2019s Jarvis or those worn by F-35 fighter plane pilots. By combining the Generative AI function, Nimo is planning to demonstrate Nimo Glasses, Nimo Core, and OS which are designed for Spatial Productivity and fit in our Pocket. Also receiving the spotlight is Jorjin\u2019s J8L Glasses, which enables an immersive Metaverse experience utilizing 9-Axis IMU and AI recognition software.\nLast December, LetinAR\u2019s technological excellence was recognized upon its selection as a finalist, again as it did four years ago, for the PRISM Awards, held by the International Society of Optics and Photonics (SPIE), the most prestigious institution in the field. SPIE shared on its website that it selected LetinAR as a finalist in the category of Vision Technology in \u201cappreciation of the company\u2019s contribution to the development of technology in this world.\u201d The final winner will be announced in San Francisco in February at the Photonics West, one of the largest optics events in the US.\nJaehyeok Kim, CEO of LetinAR, says, \u201cIt was LetinAR\u2019s strong technological base that enabled us to not only overcome the limitations of the existing AR optical system but also to overcome the vertical viewing angle issue, which has been regarded as a major technological challenge\u201d, and added that \u201cIt is glad to demonstrate diverse smartglasses launched by our global customers all around the world at the CES 2024.\u201d\nLerdah Wang, General Manager of Jorjin, says, \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to say that Jorjin\u2019s J8L AR smart glasses powered by outstanding PinTILT\u2122 technology from LetinAR can bring users an incredible experience in special field applications.\u201d, and \u201cThe slim design and lightweight can fit for wearing for a long time. With gesture recognition, the human-computing interaction is intuitive and can be used in a wide range of fields such as smart manufacturing, smart showroom, city touring, immersive collaboration and education, and smart medical applications for augmented upgrading and digital transformation.\u201d\nRohildev, CEO of Nimo Planet, says, \u201cAt Nimo, our highest priority is to create extremely comfortable and high-quality AR Glasses for Productivity.\u201d, and \u201cWorking with LetinAR enabled us to create Beautifully designed glasses with ultra-comfort\u201d.\nYang Sang-hwan, the director of the Naver D2 Startup Factory, explained that \u201cLetinAR\u2019s technology excels to the point that it may earn the PRISM Award by SPIE, the leading authority in the field of optics, and it\u2019s encouraging to see how the company proves to the world its ability to overcome technological challenges.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cLetinAR\u2019s PinTILT\u2122 technology will spearhead the commercialization of AR smart glasses.\u201d\nSince its inception in 2016, LetinAR with PinTILT\u2122 technology has been in the global spotlight during the previous CES and MWC. As of late, LetinAR is taking a radical leap towards the next business phase with several global AR companies with FrontiAR\u2122 optical system, the first truly mass-produced AR optics based on plastic injection molding technology.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar.

During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nPeak Chic: Balenciaga's $5,600 Snowboard Leads a Flurry of Luxury Skiwear and Accessories\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM's New Campaign\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nJenna Ortega\u2019s Emmy Red Carpet Look Generated $5.6 Million in Media Exposure for Dior at the Emmys\nHow to Watch NCAA Women\u2019s College Basketball on TV (and Where to Find a Livestream Online)\nA New \u2018Barbie\u2019 Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie\u2019s Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nHow to Stream \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season 28 Online Without Cable\nOmega Fetes Andrew Garfield With Dinner During Paris\u00a0Men\u2019s Fashion Week\nOne of the Best 4K Projector TVs Is On Sale Ahead of Your Super Bowl Viewing Party\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nH-Town Shares Music Video For \"Strokey Doke\" Starring Drea Kelly\nYou may also like\nThe Best Medicine Balls, According to Fitness Trainers\nFord\u2019s New Mach-E Mustang Bronze Is Its Fastest Electric Model Yet\nGeorge Clinton Reflects On Walk Of Fame Star: \u201cThis Feels Good As\u00a0Sh*t\u201d\nSubscriber Support\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nLegal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nHave a Tip?\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nOur Sites\nNews\nExpand news menu\nFilm\nExpand film menu\nTV\nExpand tv menu\nAwards\nExpand awards menu\nLifestyle\nExpand lifestyle menu\nBusiness\nExpand business menu\nMore Essentials\nExpand more-essentials menu\nFollow Us\nAlerts & Newsletters\noptional screen reader"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

The 4 most outlandish displays at CES 2024\nWhat is CES without some wacky tech you may never want?\nScharon Harding\n-\nJan 16, 2024 1:30 pm UTC\nCES is a mixed bag featuring real products you might want, announcements about upcoming tech you may not see for years, and vaporware that makes you wonder, \"Who would want this?\"\nBut the wacky, wild, and, at times, unrealistic are part of what makes CES, CES. With any hope, some of these developments could lead to innovative new products that consumers could benefit from. While some of the bizarre ideas feel mostly like ways for tech brands to show off, they are also ripe for ridicule.\nEither way, let's open our imaginations and check out the most outlandish displays, including concepts and real products, announced at CES 2024.\nLG DukeBox\nPut this one under the \u201cexperiment\u201d column. The DukeBox speaker comes from LG Labs, which LG readily describes as a \u201cmarketing platform established to deliver experimental and innovative product and service experiences.\" Currently, LG has no plans to release the DukeBox.\nThe DukeBox experiment is a 300 W speaker with vacuum tube amplifiers. Before you ask if it\u2019s 2012 again, there\u2019s more to the DukeBox. In a retro twist, the speaker\u2019s tubular innards are proudly visible behind a 30-inch see-through OLED screen with adjustable transparency. According to LG Labs\u2019 announcement, the concept has \u201cfront-facing speakers at the bottom and a 360-degree speaker at the top.\u201d\nWhen LG announced the DukeBox ahead of CES, I was skeptical about the concept, including how functional the prototype's flashy features would be in person. But CNET looked at a working prototype and heard the speaker playing quality audio. LG also showed the transparent screen capable of showing Spotify and other music player visuals, including custom ones and video.\nLG\u2019s experiment is one of the most fun takes I\u2019ve yet seen of speakers that look like something besides clunky hunks of plastic and metal invoking trypophobia, like Samsung\u2019s Music Frame speaker, which also displays a printed piece of art or photo (also announced at CES 2024), and Ikea and Sonos\u2019 Symfonisk speaker/picture frame.\nSee if you agree by checking out CNET\u2019s demo of the DukeBox prototype.\nChannel Ars Technica\nRelated Stories\nToday on Ars\nNewsletter Signup\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
