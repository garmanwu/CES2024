It is the first-of-its-kind medical pulse oximetry solution for infants that doesn't require a prescription. Extensively tested in hospital and at-home settings, Dream Sock complies with all relevant performance and safety standards, providing accurate and actionable data to parents.\nDr. Alisa Niksch, Pediatric Cardiologist and Senior Director of Medical Affairs at Owlet, emphasized Dream Sock\u2019s\nsignificance as it equips parents with real-time data on their infant's health.\n\u201cDream Sock is a breakthrough product for the industry and expands our medical-grademonitoring technology to all consumers. This device will equip parents of otherwise healthy babies with the real-time data they need to make informed care decisions for their infants. Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\u201d\nThe device allows caregivers to track their infant\u2019s Live Health Readings, including\npulse rate and oxygen saturation levels, via the Owlet Dream App (available for iOS & Android). It also provides real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen, offering peace of mind to parents.\nBuy Owlet FDA-Cleared Dream Sock\nOwlet FDA-Cleared BabySatGearBrain\nBabySat, another FDA-cleared device, combines hospital\ngrade accuracy with Owlet\u2019s modern, wire-free sock design. Designed for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs. with acute or chronic medical conditions, BabySat is available through prescription only. It allows healthcare providers to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate tailored to an infant\u2019s individual needs.\nResearch indicates that in-home pulse oximetry monitoring reduces infant mortality rates by 40% for complex congenital heart disease. BabySat, which is eligible for insurance reimbursement, facilitates better care coordination between healthcare providers and caregivers, giving parents greater confidence in monitoring their infants at home.\nJim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare highlighted the significance of BabySat in enhancing care coordination beyond the hospital, empowering parents of infants with health conditions to take control of their child's well-being.\n\u201cThe launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhancecare coordination outside of the hospital. It extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nBuy Cleared BabySat\nOwlet remains committed to offering products that set new standards in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to provide caregivers with peace of mind while monitoring their infants.

        "content": "Leveraging a technology out of Cornell Lab called Merlin Bird ID, these binoculars allow the user to just point at a wildlife subject and click a button, while the AX Visio goes on to identify up to 8,000 species of birds and 100 mammals in the U.S.\nThat\u2019s headliner, but the binoculars also include a 13MP still camera, video recording, and feature called Shared Discoveries that allows you to spot a subject, hand the binoculars over to another person, and have the binoculars help that locate the same subject in the field of view.\n If it reaches a high-pile carpet that its mop pads can\u2019t clear, the robot will return to its base and deposit the mop, return to the carpet to vacuum, and then return to the base to pick up the mop.\n Segway Xafari\nRobotics company Segway is stepping\u2014er, riding\u2014into the world of e-bikes this year with the debut of the Xafari at CES.\nDesigned for off-roading, this bike features a rugged one-piece frame, an 80-mm front and 70-mm rear suspension, 26-by-3-inch all-terrain wheels, a 913 watt-hour battery, and a 750W 80 Nm motor.\n Tiki Smart\nA smart device 22 years in the making, the Tiki is a portable hub that works alongside tags and wearables to create zones in the home and ultimately alert parents when kids get too close to danger zones like pools, wood stoves, kitchen knives, and cleaning cabinets.\n When paired with a communication buoy called the Aiper HydroComm (a separate purchase), you can wirelessly control the Scuba S1 Pro and even send it to the top of the water so that it's easy to remove.\n",

        "raw_content": "The Reviewed Awards: CES 2024\u2014The best of what\u2019s to come\nOur favorite new products from the world's biggest tech show\nUpdated January 10, 2024\nRecommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nAnother CES is here, and along with it, our team\u2019s endless march through the halls of Las Vegas to vet the thousands of debuting products eager for their moment in the spotlight. While we didn\u2019t love everything we saw, we did love a bunch of them! In fact, there were 48 products that singled themselves out as particularly noteworthy this year.\nThese winners of The Reviewed Awards: CES 2024 stood out for their excellence in innovation, core technology, design, and/or value. We congratulate all the brands and look forward to getting these products into our labs in the coming year.\nHome Theater\nThe LG OLED T made waves at CES 2024 with its transparent screen.\nLG Signature OLED T\nThe OLED T is the culmination of LG\u2019s years-long strategy to bring a transparent TV to the marketplace. Yes, you read correctly: You can see right through this 77-inch, 4K OLED TV. If you don\u2019t like it when movie characters are transparent, don\u2019t worry: At the click of a button, a special contrast film behind the see-through display mechanically unspools, turning the OLED T from something out of Minority Report into a standard-issue LG OLED TV\u2014perfect black levels and all. If that weren\u2019t futuristic enough, the OLED T also takes advantage of LG's Zero Connect box, which keeps most of the TV\u2019s internals and inputs\u2014including HDMI ports\u2014in a separate, wirelessly connected box elsewhere in the room. It's an impressive\u2014albeit trippy\u2014sight to behold, but one that will likely cost you significantly more than just about any TV you can buy when it's released later this year.\nAvailable in 2024.\nSamsung S95D\nSamsung is running a familiar playbook in 2024, but that's perfectly fine with us. The S95D looks nearly identical to its award-winning predecessor, the S95C, but being one of the only QD-OLED TVs at CES this year, the S95D is one of the best-looking TVs of the show by default. Its dazzling picture sports the same advantages that we've come to expect from this relatively new display technology: bright, bold color, scintillating highlights, and the inky black levels only OLED can pull off. New to the S95D is an anti-glare coating that eliminates bright, garish reflections and gives the picture a pleasant matte-like expression. The S95D almost certainly won\u2019t come cheap, but it\u2019s also almost certain to be one of the best TVs of the year, if recent history is any indication.\nAvailable in 2024.\nHisense 110UX\nDuring a year of impressive brightness improvements from TV manufacturers, Hisense rules the roost with the 110UX that boasts a mind-boggling 10,000 nits of brightness paired with 40,000 dimming zones and 95% coverage of the BT.2020 color space. There isn\u2019t another TV available or announced that\u2019s capable of these specs. The 110UX will run on Google TV OS (as will all US-market Hisense TVs this year), and a 4.2.2-channel speaker system with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect technology.\nAvailable in 2024.\nLG G4\nThe G4 is the crown jewel of LG's mainline 2024 OLED TV lineup, and the follow-up to the best LG TV we tested last year: the G3. Like the G3, the G4 uses an impressive bit of hardware called MLA (Micro Lens Array) technology, which efficiently refocuses light in order to achieve brighter highlights than those of traditional OLEDs. The G3 proved to us that LG could compete with bright, heavy-hitting QD-OLEDs from Samsung and Sony, and the G4 is poised to reinforce that statement this year. It's one of just three LG OLED TVs to feature the company's newest a11 AI Processor. According to LG, the a11 chipset's AI-based processes enhance color, clarity, and upscaling. The G4's sure-to-be-smorgasbord of features include a 144Hz refresh rate and LG's Game Optimizer mode.\nAvailable in 2024.\nHisense U6N 55-inch\nHisense's entry-level ULED TV, the U6N, is the most affordable mini-LED TV we've seen to date. It's the follow-up to one of our favorite budget-friendly TVs of 2023, the U6K mini-LED TV, whose 55-inch model cost just $500 at launch. This year, the 55-inch U6N is debuting at just $400. It's a bargain of the highest order, as it features quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting, and the versatility of a built-in Google TV experience. If the U6N performs anywhere near as respectively as its predecessor, it's on a fast track to the top of our list ofthe best budget TVs.\nAvailable in 2024.\nTCL QM89\nWhile we certainly didn't have \"world's biggest mini-LED TV\" on our CES bingo card, we were nevertheless excited to see it. The gargantuan TCL QM89 features 4K resolution, 20,000 mini-LED zones, and quantum-dot color, just for good measure. It's a peripheral-vision-obliterating marvel, even if most of us wouldn't be able to fit it in our living rooms.\nAvailable in 2024.\nLaptops & Computing\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo can be propped up vertically, horizontally, or laid flat.\nASUS Zenbook Duo\nWhile many of the new laptops unveiled at CES 2024 played it safe, sticking to OLED screen upgrades or new Meteor Lake or Hawk Point processors from Intel and AMD, respectively, Asus shook up its Zenbook Duo line with a wholly new form factor. Dual-screen laptops aren\u2019t totally new, but Asus\u2019s refinement has taken things to a new level. Configurable with up to two 14-inch, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED panels that unfold into 19.8 inches of screen space, the Zenbook Duo can be propped up vertically, horizontally, or laid flat for extra real estate. But the Duo\u2019s secret weapon (apart from a semi-competitive starting price of $1,499), is the magnetic keyboard that connects either over Bluetooth or via pogo pins so you can use it like a normal laptop with zero input latency. It even comes with a backpack, laptop sleeve, and a pen.\nAvailable in 2024.\nLenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nWindows 11 has evolved into a fine operating system for desktops and laptops, but the tablet PC experience leaves a lot to be desired. Similarly, Android OS has matured but still lacks a satisfying keyboard-and-mouse productivity experience to rival what a full-fledged PC can provide.\nEnter Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid Laptop. It's a 2-in-1 device that functions as a full-fledged Windows 11 computer when the display-half of the device is attached to its keyboard base. In PC mode, it\u2019s powered by an Intel Core Ultra processor with Intel Arc graphics\u2014great for plowing through productivity tasks. But detach the 14-inch, 2.8K OLED display and you have a Qualcomm-powered Android tablet on your hands, ready to take on mobile tasks using all that the mobile OS has to offer, including a full suite of productivity apps like Slack, Adobe Lightroom, and Microsoft 365. It's a rare device designed to overcome its weaknesses right out of the gate, and we can't wait to spend some serious time testing it.\nAvailable in 2024.\nDell XPS 16\nDell\u2019s new XPS line for 2024 is carrying over the beautiful, minimalist aesthetic of the previous gen\u2019s models, but much is changing in screen sizes and what\u2019s under the hood. While the old XPS 13 Plus is being made over as the XPS 13, the old XPS 15 and 17 are gone, replaced by 14- and 16-inch models. Of the bunch, the XPS 16 caught our fancy\u2014just the right size and well-equipped without having too much bulk. It features the latest Intel Core Ultra processors all the way up to the top-of-the-line Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, which includes an NPU for AI workflows, as well as NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs (up to an RTX 4070 mobile). Expect to see the same revamped keyboard layout introduced with the XPS 13, as well as the touch bar along the top row and a palm rest-spanning trackpad. The XPS 16 starts at $1,899.\nAvailable in 2024.\nSmart Home\nThe Lockly Visage promises an ultra smooth smart lock experience.\nLockly Visage\nThe Lockly Visage is a smart lock with built-in Wi-Fi that uses facial recognition to unlock the front door\u2014a game-changer for smart locks. While we've seen smart locks with a video doorbell component, the Visage is unique because it can scan approved faces (even in darkness) and automatically unlock the door.\nThe lock also works with Apple HomeKey, the Apple Home app, and Siri, and it offers seven ways to open the door, including a fingerprint reader and digital keypad, sending real-time alerts when motion is detected. The Visage will be available in satin nickel and matte black.\nAvailable in Summer 2024.\nAbode Edge\nThe Abode Edge is a first-of-its-kind wireless home security camera with an impressive transmission range of over 1.5 miles and smart AI detection for motion, people, and cars. The camera uses Wi-Fi HaLow, meaning it can operate on narrow frequency bands over a long distance, offering better and more reliable coverage than traditional Wi-Fi.\nMade for the outdoors, the camera is IP67-rated and is waterproof. It works with Alexa and Google Assistant and has a battery life of six to 12 months depending on usage.\nAvailable before Q3 2024.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra is the first smart hybrid whole-home battery generator providing up to 21.6kW output and 5.6kW solar input. The system is ideal for homes that experience frequent power outages or want to use solar power to save on energy costs.\nThe Delta Pro Ultra is a portable power station on wheels that uses lithium-ion phosphate batteries. It can also be directly connected to your home using the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2. Together, the two systems can keep devices in your home powered when the grid goes down.\nThe flexible setup allows you to add multiple batteries that neatly stack on top of one another for long-term power.\nAvailable now.\nGE Cync Reveal HD+ Full Color Undercabinet Fixtures and Pucks\nThe Cync Reveal HD+ Full Color Undercabinet Fixtures and Pucks are an exciting new way to light up your kitchen. Gone are the days of using brackets and hoping the adhesive holds on smart strip lights\u2014these undercabinet lights use screws and plug-ins, or you can hardwire them in for a flexible installation.\nThese dimmable lights are vibrant, offering more than 16 million collars. The design is sleek with a slim profile. The Undercabinet Fixtures come in three sizes, and the Pucks are for smaller areas. Plug-in or hardwired, the fixtures are semi-permanent to permanent, and a maximum of 10 lights can be connected wirelessly, with controls available from Alexa, Google, the Cync app, Matter, or the Savant professional app.\nAvailable in 2024.\nHeadphones\nThe real-time biometric feedback features of the Sennheiser Momentum Sport push the envelope.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nYou\u2019d think a Sennheiser earbuds pair would be winning an award for its sound quality, and while we expect the Momentum Sport to appeal to many on that front, what\u2019s really interesting about these sport earbuds are the extra unique features along for the ride. Most notably, the IP55-rated Sennheiser Momentum Sport allows for real-time biometric feedback from a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and body temperature sensor that connects to supported apps. While heart rate tracking through apps including Apple Health, Garmin Connect, and Strava isn\u2019t a novel feature, the Momentum Sport will be the first non-Polar product able to link within that ecosystem for body temperature analytics.\nThere\u2019s also what Sennheiser calls an acoustic relief channel\u2014a small hole near the driver of each earbud\u2014that helps to lessen distracting body noises such as your breathing and footsteps. Four wings and three ear tips offer plenty of options for a secure fit.\nAvailable April 9, 2024.\nWatches & Wearables\nThe Garmin HRM-Fit syncs your data with your compatible Garmin watch, making it a comfortable game changer in the heart rate monitor field.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nLike other chest-worn monitors we know and love from Garmin, the new HRM-Fit accurately monitors and records heart rate and training data for activities such as running, HIIT, cycling, strength training, and more.\nIt also tracks your usual stats like steps, calories burned, and intensity minutes, as well as running dynamics such as ground contact time, cadence, and stride length. The HRM-Fit syncs your data with your compatible Garmin watch, but can also store data if your watch is out of range.\nThis device is a game changer for anyone prone to chafing or irritation from wearing a heart rate monitor under their sports bra, and we\u2019re excited to see it hit the market.\nAvailable in January 2024.\nKitchen & Cooking\nThis battery-powered induction cooktop boasts a more energy-efficient experience than gas ranges.\nImpulse Induction Cooktop\nYou can now switch from gas to induction cooking without hiring an electrician. Induction ranges are becoming the healthier, more sustainable choice over gas, and now Impulse Labs is taking that initiative one step further with its new battery-powered induction cooktop.\nThis technology can run on a typical 120V outlet, which means even homes that have been designed for gas cooking can easily make the switch without much expense. Less electricity usage, saves on energy bills and benefits the environment. It also means the energy output is more efficient, resulting in burners that are three times more powerful than typical induction and five times more powerful than gas.\nThis cooktop also boasts a sleek LCD touchscreen, magnetic knobs for easy cleaning, and integrated temperature sensors for a seamless user experience that leaves little room for error while cooking.\nAvailable in Q4 2024.\nCurrent Backyard Model G Dual-Zone Electric Grill\n2024 is the year of electric alternatives. From induction ranges to outdoor grills, many of us are ditching gas for the sake of cleaner air and a more seamless user experience.\nThat's what made the Current Backyard Model G Dual-Zone Electric Grill catch our eye at CES 2024. With a classic look but plenty of modern features, this grill makes propane tanks a thing of the past. It boasts the ability to reach temperatures of 700\u00b0F\u2014150\u00b0F higher than a typical gas grill\u2014plus convenient features like self-cleaning and a connected app for easy remote control and monitoring.\nThis Current Backyard grill also features four probes that can each be independently set through the app, so you can reliably cook meat to the exact liking of multiple guests at the same time.\nAvailable in February 2024.\nGE Profile Indoor Smoker\nSmoking is no longer relegated to an outdoor activity, and we\u2019re talking about food here. The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker with Active Smoke Filtration is bringing that flavorful cooking method to your kitchen.\nIts unique smoke filtration technology transforms smoke into warm air, making it safe to use indoors. It uses the same wood pellets and outdoor smoking technology that traditional barbecue smoking enthusiasts are used to, so there's no learning curve.\nIn fact, this appliance comes equipped with an intuitive control panel and six presets (think brisket, chicken wings, and salmon) to make smoking a seamless cooking method.\nAvailable now.\nRevolution Cooking Macrowave Oven\nWe've lauded the convenience of multipurpose countertop appliances like air fryer toaster ovens for many years, but Revolution Cooking is taking it a step further.\nThe Macrowave Oven is a smart countertop oven, air fryer, pizza oven, microwave, and more\u2014all in one machine. It combines microwave cooking and convection baking by using the brand's patented InstaGlo technology, which uses specialized alloys and integrated algorithms to deliver a wide range of cooking functions with impressively fast results.\nThe Macrowave is also incredibly user-friendly, thanks to the LCD touchscreen control panel and accompanying accessories\u2014including a built-in temperature probe to achieve exacting doneness.\nAvailable in 2024.\nBello water filter and infusion system\nCombine concern about water safety and plastic waste with the ever-growing trend of drink systems, and you have the Bello water filter.\nThis sleek water filter is also a smart infusion system, adding customizable flavors and nutrients to water as it purifies, so you don't have to stock up on single-use bottles and cans to quench your thirst. The companion app tracks usage and alerts you when you\u2019re running low on flavors.\nBesides tasting great (we got to sample some at CES) and minimizing the impacts of single-use waste, Bello prioritizes sustainability with its long-lasting flavor capsules, which are made of recyclable glass\u2014not plastic\u2014and last for up to 50 servings. Plus, its contents are made from real fruits, teas, and other ingredients, without unnecessary additives or sugars.\nAvailable in Q2 2024.\nExoBrew Craft Gen 3\nThe new ExoBrew Craft Gen 3 takes the complexity of beer brewing, no matter what type of beer you like to drink. ExoBrew can guide you to create 1.6 gallons of quality brew at home\u2014including cider and kombucha\u2014in less time and with more assurance and guidance than other brew kits.\nThe creators of ExoBrew have taken the traditional beer-brewing system, shrunk it down to a size suitable for a home kitchen, and added smart capabilities while allowing you to enjoy the spirit of beer brewing. Users can follow prescribed recipes or create their own. You can also source all ingredients from ExoBrew and try a variety of different brews.\nAvailable in Q1 2024.\nBarsys 360\nBarsys 360 is the bar accessory we didn\u2019t know we were missing, until now. Cocktail shakers will be gathering dust, and if you\u2019ve ever been intimidated by mixing cocktails, Barsys brings the confidence.\nThe sleek countertop bartender belies its hidden talents. With ports to hold 32 ounces each of six different liquids, you can dispense liquors and mixers in the quantities of your choosing, or select a drink in the connected app and let Barsys do the work for you.\nThe app displays drinks that can be made with the liquids you\u2019ve loaded into the machine, taking the guesswork out of home bartending. If you use the companion cup, it automatically stirs your drink until you remove it from the Barsys spotlight, which turns green to let you know it\u2019s ready.\nAvailable in Q1 2024.\nAppliances & Cleaning\nAmple space and noteworthy speed are two hallmarks of this LG Washer and Dryer Combo.\nLG 27-inch Washer & Dryer Combo\nOver 2023, our laundry experts have noticed a trend: More big name appliance brands are bringing washer-dryer combo units to market, and this one from LG is the best one we\u2019ve seen at CES 2024.\nAlthough the basic tech\u2014washer plus heat pump dryer\u2014is identical to the GE Profile washer-dryer combo that launched at KBIS last year (and we tested it in our labs), there are a few points of differentiation. The LG's drum is 0.2 cubic feet larger, and it's 14% faster (if its claim on the Normal cycle holds true).\nBut best of all, this LG machine includes the Sidekick, a space below the main drum for delicates, which adds an additional cubic foot of washing space. Watch out Profile\u2014this LG is coming for you.\nAvailable in 2024.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra\nIf you\u2019re a floor care nerd like us, you may have noticed robot vacuums and robot vacuum-mop hybrids infiltrating the market\u2014beyond popular long-time brands iRobot and Ecovacs. This year at CES 2024, we\u2019ve navigated our way to at least a half-dozen, and the DreameBot X30 Ultra from maker Dreame offers some serious innovations we can appreciate.\nIt claims a suction power of 8,300 pa, which is even more than the Narwal Freo X Ultra at 8,200 pa, another CES 2024 debut. While we appreciate higher suction pressure, it\u2019s not the end all be all of a great robot vacuum-mop. Lots of other variables matter, including navigation.\nThe DreameBot X30 Ultra can seamlessly and automatically transition from vacuum to mop functionality, based on what it detects on your floor surface. If it reaches a high-pile carpet that its mop pads can\u2019t clear, the robot will return to its base and deposit the mop, return to the carpet to vacuum, and then return to the base to pick up the mop.\nOther perks include a self-cleaning base, an optional water hook up, a flexible mopping arm, an extra-long battery life, and cutting heads on the vacuum designed to cut tangles off the brush without damaging flooring.\nAvailable February 28, 2024.\nEureka J20 2-in-1 Robotic Vacuum-mop\nWe are already testing this puppy in our Cambridge lab, but even without conclusive results yet, we feel like the Eureka J20 2-in-1 robot mop deserves a Reviewed Award, CES-edition.\nTwo things have caught our expert\u2019s eye. Most robot mops use spinning circular pads to wipe up messes. Instead, the J20 features a cycling belt that allows it to consistently replenish with fresh, clean water, which means it can more effectively tackle tougher stains and your floors will be cleaner. Next, we\u2019ve only ever seen an \u201cadd detergent\u201d feature in a competitor, Narwal, and its functionality wasn\u2019t great, but we think Eureka can pull it off.\nAvailable April 2024\nTineco Pure One Station\nWho doesn\u2019t like a product that makes life easier while doing a more effective job? We like what we see from Tineco on the showfloor, especially its Pure One Station vac, which not only cleans your floor, it cleans itself.\nPull this smart stick vac off its base to suck up dry spills and other debris, and then pop it back on its base. The base will initiate a top-to-bottom cleaning program that includes the dock, the vacuum\u2019s rollers, its tubes, and the HEPA filter. Then you only have to empty the base once every 60 days or so, based on average use.\nAll the rest of the things we love about Tineco models\u2014incredible suction, dust sensor system, intuitive LED display\u2014haven\u2019t gone anywhere.\nAvailable in 2024.\nEcovacs Winbot W2 Omni\nRobot vacuums we\u2019ve got, but robot window cleaners? Not so much. However, this year at CES 2024, Ecovacs unleashes a 6-year-in-the-making upgrade to what we consider to be the market\u2019s first and only reputable one. The Winbot W2 Omni uses its own proprietary navigation system, an anti-slip rolling movement, and a wide-angle, 3-nozzle spray technique to ensure windows get cleaned right to the edge.\nWhen it comes to surface type and area, the Winbot W2 Omni tackles everything from mirrors to floor-to-ceiling windows\u2014no job too big or too small. Trust us when we say we can\u2019t wait to get it into our lab and throw some serious challenges its way.\nAvailable in Spring 2024.\nHisense Smart Built-In Dishwasher with Autodose and Autodry\nKnown more for its TVs than its large appliances in the U.S. market, Hisense has been quietly inserting its presence with tech-forward iterations that offer mass market consumers great value. This smart dishwasher is a great example.\nIts biggest boon is its auto-dosing feature that automatically releases a dose of liquid detergent for each cycle, and users only have to replenish the well once per month. While we\u2019ve seen auto-dose functionality in more premium brands like Miele, which uses a proprietary detergent disc, this Hisense uses any liquid detergent, measured per cycle demand, and does so at an affordable price point.\nMore smart functionality follows with an auto-dry feature that pops the door open after running to let out steam. When in operation, this smart dishwasher only hits 40 dba\u2014just a hair louder than upmarket whisper-quiet Bosch 800 Series. Again, at a low price.\nAvailable in 2024.\nAiper Scuba S1 Pro\nPart of Aiper\u2019s new Scuba series, the S1 Pro pool cleaning robot has five cleaning modes and is meant for in-ground pools up to 2,150 square feet. It also boasts an impressive new feature that skims the waterline for debris.\nNavigating around underwater using its caterpillar tread, the Scuba S1 Pro moves around obstacles using built-in sensors. When paired with a communication buoy called the Aiper HydroComm (a separate purchase), you can wirelessly control the Scuba S1 Pro and even send it to the top of the water so that it's easy to remove.\nAvailable for preorder; releasing in March for $1,199.99.\nDreo MC710S\nIn a class by itself, the impressive Dreo MC710S combines a fan and air purifier into one multifunctional device that you can control with Alexa or Google Assistant.\nDC brushless dual motors generate faster air speeds and more air volume at 12 fan speeds. It also has sensors that check for air quality and temperature, and users can adjust it to blow air at a preferred temperature. The air purifier traps more than 99.97% of particles from common household irritants like dust, pollen, dander, and smoke.\nAvailable in March 2024.\nBio Bidet BB-1200\nThe Bemis Bio Bidet BB-1200 is one of the first bidet toilet seats in the U.S. that works with a smartphone app. Using the Bemis Living app for iOS or Android, you can access features like customizable wash settings and presets for a personalized potty break.\nThe BB-1200 bidet seat can be attached to existing elongated toilets, and other notable features are a self-cleaning nozzle, a rear and front wash, a heated seat, and unlimited warm water.\nAvailable in April 2024.\nKohler Rista Vessel Bathroom Sink\nLeave it to Kohler to find a way to flawlessly intertwine cutting-edge technology and elegant aesthetics. Making its debut, Rista, a stunning bathroom sink, isn\u2019t like anything we\u2019ve ever seen\u2014in fact, it's crafted by artisans and made by a 3D printer of durable vitreous China, ensuring uniqueness and a long lifespan.\nAvailable in February 2024.\nTablets\nThe TCL Nxtpaper 14 Pro has a matte finish and a number of proprietary blue-light-reducing features that make it easy on the eyes.\nTCL Nxtpaper 14 Pro\nTablets are great but can result in eye strain due to blue spectrum light exposure. It's an issue that TCL has been working to solve with its NxtPaper 3.0 displays, like the one built into the TCL NxtPaper 14 Pro tablet. The tablet offers the same crisp high-resolution viewing that high-definition OLEDs are known for. But, with a matte finish and a number of proprietary blue-light-reducing features, it has more in common with the electronic paper screens in an Amazon Kindle or reMarkable 2 than it does with an iPad. NxtPaper's similarities to some of our favorite E Ink devices don't stop there: with the flick of a dedicated switch, the colors of the TCL NxtPaper 14 Pro will desaturate to black and white, transforming it from a large tablet into a large e-reader. That it's designed to run Android means that no matter which display mode you use the 14 Pro in, you won't find yourself hurting for content to consume. And, while its MediaTek processor may be nothing to write home about, this device is up to the task of helping to plow through any productivity task you throw at it, with horsepower to spare for a little light gaming after you're done.\nAvailable in 2024.\nPhoto & Video\nThe Swarovski Optik AX Visio smart binoculars have game-changing built-in AI species recognition.\nSwarovski Optik AX Visio smart binoculars\nWe don\u2019t tend to see a lot of exciting bird-watching tech at CES, but this one really caught our attention. Swarovski Optik (the branch of the company that makes optical scopes, not figurines) debuted the AX Visio: smart binoculars with AI species recognition built right into the device.\nLeveraging a technology out of Cornell Lab called Merlin Bird ID, these binoculars allow the user to just point at a wildlife subject and click a button, while the AX Visio goes on to identify up to 8,000 species of birds and 100 mammals in the U.S.\nThat\u2019s headliner, but the binoculars also include a 13MP still camera, video recording, and feature called Shared Discoveries that allows you to spot a subject, hand the binoculars over to another person, and have the binoculars help that locate the same subject in the field of view.\nAt $4,800, they\u2019re not cheap, but the technology feels like the beginning of big changes for nature lovers.\nAvailable in February 2024.\nSleep\nThe ANSSil Sleepinbody-Incline Smart Mattress collects data from the sleeper's body and offers suggestions for optimal rest.\nANSSil Sleepinbody-Incline Smart Mattress\nThe big theme of CES 2024 is AI, and not even mattresses are safe from this controversial technology. The Anssil Sleepinbody Incline is a smart mattress that utilizes AI and IOT connectivity to create a holistic sleeping environment.\nThe mattress gathers data throughout the day from connected smart scales and fitness trackers, utilizes real-time data from the sleeper from sensors embedded in the mattress, and adjusts firmness and incline. The mattress will also process the user\u2019s sleep data and recommend them services and suggestions to improve their sleep.\nParenting & Kids\nThe Owlet BabySat tracks a baby\u2019s vitals in real time with hospital-grade quality.\nOwlet BabySat\nRecognized in parenting circles for a decade already, Owlet has just unveiled BabySat, its first hospital-grade monitoring offering for use at home.\nThe fabric BabySat sock is FDA-cleared and clinically-proven to be safe and accurate for monitoring a baby\u2019s vitals, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation levels, in real time.\nThe sock sensor sends health readings to an included base station and the Owlet Care+ App; any variations in vital signs will trigger alerts to both. The monitoring system is intended for infants between one and 18 months and does require a prescription from a healthcare provider.\nAvailable now.\nGl\u00fcxkind Rosa Smart Travel System\nA modular stroller that includes a bassinet and car seat, the Rosa system has a 500W duo-motor powertrain to make uphill walks easier and to slow the downhill walks, as well.\nWe also love that it has a camera in the handlebar to authorize who uses the stroller, a nice safety feature. Additional features include automatic rocking to help a little one nap uninterrupted, and audio for white noise or story time. No wonder it won a 2024 CES Innovation Award.\nAvailable for pre-order now; delivery starts July 2024.\nTiki Smart\nA smart device 22 years in the making, the Tiki is a portable hub that works alongside tags and wearables to create zones in the home and ultimately alert parents when kids get too close to danger zones like pools, wood stoves, kitchen knives, and cleaning cabinets.\nDesigned to protect children from potential falls, burns, cuts, poisonings or drownings, the Tiki solution includes a Smart Box hub, a children\u2019s bracelet, tags that define danger zones and a mobile app.\nWhen a child enters a predetermined danger zone the Smart Box alerts at 90 db volume with a flashing signal and the mobile app sends a notification.\nAvailable in 2024.\nBeauty & Grooming\nThe eco-friendly L\u2019Oreal Airlight Pro dries hair faster than other hair dryers on the market.\nL\u2019Oreal Airlight Pro\nThe newest hair dryer from L'Or\u00e9al Groupe focuses on reducing its environmental impact by using groundbreaking technology that was innovated in partnership with Chinese startup Zuvi, a hardware company powered by drone engineers and scientists.\nUsing a combination of powerfully optimized heat flow, infrared-light technology, and high-speed wind, the AirLight Pro promises to dry a range of hair types faster than other hair dryers on the market and use up to 31% less energy consumption. With award-winning technology and an exceptional impact on sustainability in the beauty industry, this professional-grade hair drying tool is leading L'Or\u00e9al into the future of beauty.\nAvailable in 2024.\nPanasonic Palm Shaver\nAt CES 2024, Panasonic announced a brand new innovation in the world of sustainable personal grooming products. The new Panasonic Palm Shaver is meant for at-home and on-the-go use, with a compact design to fit in the palm of your hand.\nThe technology features a five-blade system powered by a linear motor to cut every strand on all types of facial hair. What makes the new grooming tool especially exciting is the advanced sensing technology that adapts to the unique contours of your face.\nOn top of that, the Palm Shaver was designed with NAGORI, a sustainable material made from sea minerals, and as a result, is helping to reduce the brand\u2019s plastic usage by 40%.\nAvailable in 2024.\nGaming\nThe first Intel processor handheld on the market has arrived in the MSI Claw.\nMSI Claw\nThere have been some notable additions to the handheld gaming category over the past year and now MSI is jumping into the fray with the Claw. What sets it apart from its competitors is the fact that the Claw will be the first Intel processor handheld on the market. The base model will be powered by an Intel Core Ultra 5 and Intel Arc integrated graphics, with the option to upgrade to a Core Ultra 7 115H (with an additional storage upgrade available from 512GB to 1TB).\nAvailable in February 2024.\nAlienware AW322QF Monitor\nThe third generation of Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED panels are, simply put, stunning. Fantastic contrast is to be expected, but the incredible color reproduction, fast pixel response times, higher brightness, and enhanced HDR capabilities make a good technology even better. The Alienware AW322QF is 4K and 32 inches, a sizing combination that gamers have been asking for for years but has only just become obtainable, and the 240Hz refresh rate should be enough for everyone but pro esports gamers (if your PC is powerful to push that many pixels, at least). The AW322QF sells for $1,199, and we suspect it will become the new \u201cend game\u201d monitor for most of the gaming world.\nAvailable January 11, 2024\nAccessibility\nThe extremely user-friendly ElliQ 3 aims to be the \"Alexa for seniors.\"\nIntuition Robotics ElliQ 3\nThe ElliQ 3 from Intuition Robotics is the third generation of an assistive device for seniors. We loved the earlier model when we reviewed it last year.\nElliQ 3 operates on a similar philosophy, attempting to be something of an \u201cAlexa for seniors.\u201d Loneliness is a growing problem for those aging in place, and this capable little device aims to curb that unfortunate reality.\nThe previous-gen product has an attractive design and bevy of games and included activities, but this version takes those sensibilities to the next level by leveraging generative artificial intelligence and large language models.\nThe new ElliQ is more capable of remembering details it\u2019s been told in the past, and it will refer back to them in future chats. It can even paint and write poems in real time. This new model is noticeably slimmer, but it packs in more ways to serve an important community.\nAvailable in February 2024.\nLumen Glasses\nWhile lovable and adorable, the guide dog is an imperfect accessibility aid for peope who are blind or have low vision. Not only are there obvious risks to putting complete trust in an animal, but millions of folks also don\u2019t have thousands and dollars and years of time required to get that type of assistance.\nLumen Glasses aim to solve these problems via headwear that combines advanced AI, robotics, and self-driving technology to instantaneously map the world for those who can\u2019t see. The headset understands the ways in which the wearer can interact with their surroundings, then it conveys that information via sound and haptics. The glasses can even become aware of specific locations to assist wearers with shopping, reading, and other daily tasks. In theory, just say \u201ctake me to the milk,\u201d and Lumen is capable of getting you there.\nWe\u2019ve seen devices like this in the past, but they\u2019ve normally taken the form of a bulky harness. This headset is the most streamlined implementation of this technology.\nAvailable in Q2 2024.\nAirDrop Gaming Audio Radar\nGaming continues to be a bastion for growth in accessibility, and AirDrop Gaming\u2019s Audio Radar is a great example of that incredible innovation. Using six RGB light bars designed to encircle a TV or monitor, Audio Radar essentially intercepts a 7.1 signal to pinpoint the direction of incoming sounds. For example, if shots or footsteps are coming from the left, the light bars on the left side of the screen light up.\nFor a more tailored experience across other genres, an included base station allows users to assign different colors to different types of sounds, while assigning the arrangements to any one of three possible presets.\nCertain games offer sound-based visual cues via baked-in accessibility features, but this is the most complete hardware-based solution we\u2019ve seen. It works across PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nAvailable now.\nOrCam Hear\nHearing aid technology is rapidly expanding, but OrCam Hear brings something truly groundbreaking to the space. Noisy and crowded environments are notoriously difficult for those with hearing loss, as singling out one voice can be nearly impossible.\nThe OrCam Hear uses a small phone attachment\nto take a quick sample of each person\u2019s voice from within a group conversation.Then each of those voices can be isolated or muted within the app, broadcasting only the desired voice to the included earbuds.\nHearing loss can lead to anxiety and social isolation, so devices like the OrCam Hear stand to have a tremendous impact on emotional well-being.\nAvailable in 2024.\nHealth & Fitness\nThe feature-loaded Segway Xafari can connect to health apps on your cell phone.\nSegway Xafari\nRobotics company Segway is stepping\u2014er, riding\u2014into the world of e-bikes this year with the debut of the Xafari at CES.\nDesigned for off-roading, this bike features a rugged one-piece frame, an 80-mm front and 70-mm rear suspension, 26-by-3-inch all-terrain wheels, a 913 watt-hour battery, and a 750W 80 Nm motor.\nRiders will be able to connect to the health apps on their mobile phones, as well as monitor mileage, speed, calories burned, and more in real time.\nAs a smart e-bike, the Xafari can also perceive conditions around you and make adjustments such as automatically adjusting the power output or turning your headlights on and off. The \u201call-in-one smart cockpit,\u201d as Segway dubs it, integrates your health apps, electronic speakers, sensor headlights, and an intelligent navigation system on a color display dashboard.\nAvailable in late 2024.\nUrtopia Fusion AI-Powered E-Bike\nA new AI-powered e-bike from Urtopia is already receiving buzz for its integration of ChatGPT. This dual-motor, dual-battery bike uses AI and ChatGPT to help plan bike routes via its smart navigation system.\nIt doesn\u2019t need to sync with your phone\u2014it\u2019s self-contained\u2014and you can pair it with the brand\u2019s smart ring (sold separately) to track your health metrics like sleep, exercise, and recovery. The smart ring can also be used to control your bike, to connect with apps like Apple Health, Google Maps, and Strava, and to recommend cycling sessions that will help you reach weekly fitness goals such as miles ridden or calories burned.\nUrtopia is known for its visually stunning and lightweight bikes, and this one is following in its predecessors footsteps. Its range and torque are stellar for such a lightweight bike, and the torque sensor aims to make your ride smoother and more efficient.\nAvailable in late 2024.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.

        "raw_content": "Electric Bike Report | Electric Bike, Ebikes, Electric Bicycles, E Bike, Reviews\nElectric Bike Reviews, News, and Information; plus e-bike riding and maintenance tips!\nSome links may be affiliate links. We may get paid if you buy something or take an action after clicking one of these.\nThe Electric Bikes at CES: All The New E-Bikes on Display\nCarbon Fiber Frames, Integrated Displays, Glossy Paint, and LEDS Galore!\nOur time at the show was limited, but we still managed to see a host of new e-bike models, speak with brands both new and old, and of course, squeeze in a ride. Follow along as we cover some of the latest developments in e-bike technology we saw at CES in Las Vegas!\nHimiway: A Revamped Lineup with a Carbon Fiber Crown Jewel\nPerhaps one of the most unexpected surprises of the show was Himiway\u2019s expansive booth which was brimming with glossy new e-bikes \u2013 some fresh and some familiar. The brand has completely revamped their line of e-bikes with new models, polished aesthetics, upgraded components, and naming conventions which group the bikes by their intended purpose.\nThe rebranded D series of e-bikes, for example, are sportier off-road capable models that are refreshed versions of the old Cobra and Zebra. The D7 Pro, which replaces the Cobra Pro, features upgraded components including a 4-piston brake system, a Shimano CUES drivetrain, a dual-crown inverted suspension fork with 220mm of travel, and a dropper seatpost.\nThe new C line is intended to be family oriented with both child- and adult-sized versions of a new moto/moped-style design. The smaller C1 (pictured below) uses a 350W rear-hub motor and is limited to 15 mph, while the full-size C5 (above) features a 750W motor and a Class 2 limit of 20 mph.\nSide note: while we look forward to testing and reviewing the full-size C5, we are currently working on a review of the C1 kids e-bike. The picture above provides a good indication of what our 6-year old tester, AJ, thinks about it!\nA new cargo/utility bike dubbed the C3 features a long step-thru frame, a 350-lb carrying capacity, and a custom wedge-style saddle. Like the C5, it hosts a 750W motor and 960 Wh battery for extended range capability.\nPerhaps the most visually stunning, however, were the X5 Pro and X5 Ultra carbon-fiber eMTBs. While both tiers of the brand\u2019s new enduro bike will only be available in a single frame size, they will be offered in full-suspension, hardtail, and fat tire variants.\nThe premium X5 Ultra will be equipped with a host of impressive components including a SRAM Eagle drivetrain, a Rockshox BoXXer suspension fork, a Rockshox wireless electronic dropper post, a clean top-tube-integrated display, a tubeless tire setup with carbon rims, and a 500W Bafang M600 mid-drive motor.\nReminiscent of the Rambler, the A7 Pro rounds out the brand\u2019s new lineup. This full-suspension commuter includes a quick-adjust seatpost, a 500W mid-drive, and a display integrated into its adjustable stem.\nUrtopia: Dashing Into the Future with Polished Designs and ChatGPT Integration\nWith all the recent buzz around AI in general and ChatGPT in particular, we were highly intrigued by the idea of integrating such functionality into an e-bike. In addition to offering stylish, futuristic designs for their three unique e-bikes, Urtopia grabbed our attention by being the first to do so.\nThe brand\u2019s flashy carbon fiber flagship, the Carbon Pro 1, features an unexpected design with a seamless, floating top tube/seat tube/seat stay element. The bike houses a 4G eSIM card that allows it to track the bike\u2019s location for phone-free navigation and security, play music through an integrated bluetooth speaker, and connect to ChatGPT.\nOur contact said that the GPT integration can do such things as helping riders set up custom routes, find the nearest coffee shop, or simply ask about the weather forecast. Our personal experiences with ChatGPT lead us to question the reliability of its information (at least in the technology\u2019s current state), but we hope to be able to test the Carbon Pro 1 for ourselves in the near future!\nUtopia also offers a more entry-level \u2013 but still impressively feature-saturated \u2013 alloy-frame city/commuter called the Chord. While it does not integrate with ChatGPT, this e-bike still offers navigation, music, etc. and pairs with the Urtopia app. The bike uses a 350W rear-hub motor with a torque sensor paired with a 353 Wh battery.\nA currently unreleased model, the Fusion, features a carbon fiber step-thru frame, dual 350W front and rear hub motors, and dual batteries (one main and one auxiliary/range extender) with a total of 860 Wh and a max range of 120 miles.\nA second version of the Fusion was offered for European cyclists; in addition to a flashier paint job, this model featured a 250W Bafang mid-drive motor that will not (currently) be available in the US.\nVanpowers: Affordable Adventure Bikes with Integrated Security Tech\nAfter being pleasantly surprised during our review of the UrbanGlide Ultra, we were excited to see the latest developments from Vanpowers. With two new offerings including a carbon fiber gravel bike and a beefy fat tire touring bike, the brand is clearly interested in diversifying their lineup and proving their competence in off-road environments.\nThe Ultra version of the fat tire GrandTeton features a 500W Bafang mid-drive and 692 Wh battery, while the more budget-friendly Pro version uses a rear-hub motor. Both have a \u201csmart box\u201d integrated into the top tube with 4G and GPS functionality for navigation and theft protection, but also an SOS feature that can alert a pre-selected contact in the event of a hard impact.\nThe 39-lb UrbanCross also features the smart hub, and is available in an Ultra version with 46cm flared drop bars or a Pro version with flat bars; both will be offered in three frame sizes. Regardless of tier, the bike uses a 250W rear hub motor with a torque sensor, a 345.6 Wh battery, a stem-integrated display, and Bluetooth connectivity with the Vanpowers app.\nHeybike: Taking a Chance with Crowdfunded Carbon Fiber\nHeybike made an appearance with three new models, including a full-suspension version of the Ranger S called the Horizon, a cargo e-bike called the Hauler, and a full-suspension, carbon fiber fat tire bike called the Hero.\nWhile details were scarce, the Hero was the star of the show with its unique step-thru frame and flashy orange-and-grey paint job. The bike uses custom carbon fiber handlebars with an integrated display, and is set to be crowdfunded through an indiegogo campaign later this spring.\nOkai: Clean Design and LEDs Are the Future of Commuting\nAs a relative newcomer to the e-bike market, Okai was a behind-the-scenes manufacturer for prominent e-bike and e-scooter brands such as Bird and Lime. Okai launched three new commuter-focused e-bike models after a year of development, all with tech at the forefront.\nThe EB60, also referred to as the Traverse, puts a huge focus on minimalistic design. The bike features an LED light bar that stretches across the full length of the handlebars for visibility, but its color and pattern can be customized to suit the rider through the Okai app. The bike uses a 350W rear hub motor with a torque sensor and an integrated 345.6 Wh battery.\nWe were impressed by the 440 lb weight capacity of the brand\u2019s utility e-bike called the EB70. Another step-thru commuter called the EB80 uses an integrated battery with LED light bars that change color to reflect battery charge.\nLooking Ahead: Design Trends for 2024\nA clean and streamlined aesthetic seems to be the new norm, with brands opting for weld-free carbon fiber frames, fully integrated batteries, seamlessly integrated displays, and automotive-quality paint jobs.\nWe can\u2019t wait to get our hands on some of these models for an even more detailed look!\nReader Interactions\nComments\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:50 am\nNo mention of the Fuell Flluid? It was (supposedly) at the Valeo booth.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 2:50 pm\nWe really wanted to get over there to see that one, but unfortunately our time was limited! Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to stay longer next year.\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 12:02 pm\nThanks for at least wanting to. As you may or may not have noticed there isn\u2019t a single mention anywhere online from anyone not named Fuell or Valeo that talked about it. Nothing Google knows about, nothing on YouTube, and nothing on Instagram.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 9:21 am\nThat\u2019s surprising, but also not. The e-bike booths were kind of scattered, so it\u2019s possible many outlets didn\u2019t even know Fuell had a presence.\nGroucho says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:30 pm\nThe Himiway C3 looks interesting. Similar to the Gazelle Easyflow, but without the comfortable bars. Cannot say about the riding position without riding it.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 10:10 am\nAgreed! We\u2019re curious about the saddle, too.\nDaniel Dickman says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 1:57 pm\nThe future is here,Baby!!! Enjoy!!!\nJaimee says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 10:35 pm\nI\u2019m kind of (pleasantly) surprised that the trend isn\u2019t toward ever more powerful motors. Apparently a 750w motor isn\u2019t the new baseline; maybe we\u2019ll see the throttle disappear on some models, too.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 12 and features about 4,000 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 130,000 attendees.

The 2024 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) always delivers some outside-the-box tech ideas. As we sort through the sea of tech, there are a few products that could see their way to the cycling market soon enough.\nEclypia Neogly\nThe Eclypia Neogly is a non-invasive, reliable continuous glucose monitor. This tech has already started its way into cycling, especially at the top level.\nRead: How continuous glucose monitors are poised to reshape pro racing\nTo develop a glycemia prediction algorithm for its CGM based on photoacoustic technique, Eclypiahas thoroughly modeled the system from laser emission to signal detection. Thanks to this code-named numerical twin, an In Silico clinical trial was performed and the obtained data set was used as a train database for a Deep Learning algorithm to predict glycemia from InVivo photoacoustic signals. Tests on real data show good results with a Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 18.4%.\nI-TEN SA Battery\nBattery technology is going to change drastically over the next 5 years and this tiny eco-friendly rechargeable solid-state battery is able to deliver high power. Its size is a clear indication of what the future will bring. Just imagine if a battery this size could power your electronic drivetrain.\nTopsecret eBike\nTopsecret\u2019s eBike uses a very unique design with hubless wheels to deliver a max torque of 140Nm with a 750w MID-drive motor. The futuristic-looking eBike doesn\u2019t save any weight by not having hubs with it hitting the scales at a claimed 26kg/58lb.\nThe hubless design isn\u2019t the only futuristic choice on the bike as Topsecret has opted for airless tires which the company claims have \u201ccharacteristics such as non-inflating, non-rupturing, bulletproof, explosion-proof, flame retardant, anti-slip, reduced heat generation, easy handling, and exchangeability.\u201d\nA Hubless E-Bikes are built with a futuristic, sophisticated design, high-quality materials, and stability. In particular, it is an urban E-Bike designed and manufactured with a high-strength, ultra-light aircraft aluminum frame and titanium material components, including innovative and stable parts with a spoke-less structure inside the E-bike wheel.\u2014Topsecret\nMindMics Heart Health System\nWhile I prefer my optical heart rate monitor, this sort of integration could lead to some really interesting options for cyclists and really anyone that is active.\n\u201cMindMics Heart Health System is an innovative and comprehensive solution designed to address the growing need for next-generation heart health monitoring. At the core of our technology is the patented in-ear Infrasonic Hemodynography (IH), which enables heart health monitoring through TWS earbuds. Our system combines clinical accuracy of a 99% IH-ECG correlation to measuring each heartbeat. MindMics provides users a dashboard based on their personal baseline showing physiological states in real time. Placing emphasis on stress recovery and blood pressure management, our solutions are tailored to meet individual needs, providing actionable steps for users to manage their health and thrive.\u201d\nRealdesigntech Co. ULTIRACER NEO Cycling Simulator\nWhile they make some bold claims, I\u2019m not sure this will be an indoor riding platform that avid cyclists connect with. Either way, it is entertaining and will be interesting to see how it evolves.\n\u201cThe 3rd generation ULTIRACER NEO is the world\u2019s best cycling simulator consisting of absolute safety, ultra-realistic cycling devices and software that synchronize real-time bicycle left-right movement with content and generates wind based on riding speed. Neo is a lifelong exercise product that fully implements balance and movement, which are key functions of outdoor cycling, allowing you to sweat in three minutes while enjoying games or virtual trips indoors at any time without the risk of external constraints or accidents.\u201d\nVuzix Ultralite S\nWhile there has been no shortage of brands trying to create small heads-up display for sports. Batteries, weight, and the restrictive design parameters of such a device have left almost all struggling to stay afloat. The Vuzix looks to be one of the first to work through a few of the many hurdles. It will be another interesting one to keep an eye on in the near future.\n\u201cVuzix Ultralite S smart glasses are part of Vuzix Ultralite OEM Platform and deliver the most fashionable and lightweight pair of smart glasses ever assembled. Vuzix Ultralite S delivers hands-free, wireless connectivity to the information on your smartphone or smartwatch, in your line of sight.

Help us to make it better.\n7 weird and wonderful cycling/fitness gadgets from CES 2024, including the indoor bike that charges your laptop, earphones that give you a training programme, and an e-bike you control with a smart ring\nThe\u00a0CES\u00a0tech expo \u2013\u00a0which used to be called the Consumer Electronics Show until it got too broad for the name \u2013\u00a0is taking place in Las Vegas right now, and here are seven of the most interesting bike and fitness products that we\u2019ve spotted so far\u2026.\nVanpowers\u2019 two new e-bikes offer \u201ca new benchmark in anti-theft protection\u201d\nVanpowers has announced two new e-bikes at CES 2024, both of which come with integrated safety features, including hub motor lock, emergency SOS, vibration detector, real-time GPS tracking, and geofencing.\n> Garmin introduces women-specific heart rate monitor and revamps Garmin Connect fitness tracking app\n\u201cThis smart system sets a new benchmark in anti-theft protection, significantly mitigating the risk of bike theft while enhancing the likelihood of successful recovery in the event of theft,\u201d says Vanpowers.\nThe UrbanCross\u00a0is a lightweight road/gravel e-bike that\u2019s targeted at urban commuters and short-distance travellers. It comes with a Shimano GRX groupset and flared gravel handlebar, and has a claimed range of up to 62 miles.\nThe GrandTeton is a mountain e-bike that comes with a 130Nm motor and torque sensor, and a removable 692 watt-hour lithium-ion battery, with a claimed range of up to 110 miles when combined with an optional power bank. You get 4-piston Tektro hydraulic disc brakes and a 120mm travel air suspension fork.\nWe don\u2019t yet have prices for these models.\nFind out more here\nSennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds monitor your heart rate and body temperature as you exercise\nGermany\u2019s Sennheiser is introducing wireless Momentum Sport earbuds that take your heart rate and measure your body temperature as you exercise.\nThe heart rate measurement comes courtesy of a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. Great word! Essentially, it\u2019s an optical measurement method, so similar to how an Apple Watch (and various other devices) takes your heart rate on your wrist, but this time via the left earbud. Other brands already offer in-ear sports earphones with heart rate measurement.\nSennheiser says, \u201cMomentum Sport\u2019s heart rate data connects and integrates seamlessly with many popular sport devices and apps, such as Apple Watch/Health, Garmin Watch/Connect, Strava, Peloton and more.\n\u201cFor the first time ever in a non-Polar product, users will be able to enjoy full access to Polar\u2019s elite biosensing capabilities and data analytics\u2014including Body Temperature\u2014offering real-time insights during training and deeper offline analysis via the Polar Flow app ecosystem.\u201d\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds come with an IP55 rating, meaning that they\u2019re dust protected and water/sweat-resistant. We do review earbuds that have a higher level of waterproofing than that.\n\u201cTo minimise footstep noise, breathing, and other body-borne distractions, the earbuds feature an acoustic relief channel and semi-open design for natural environmental awareness,\u201d says Sennheiser.\nBody-borne distractions? Seems a bit harsh to describe breathing that way, considering how handy it is.\n\u201cAn adjustable Transparency mode, Anti-wind mode, and Adaptive Noise Cancelling mode let the wearer easily adapt as their surroundings change,\u201d says Sennheiser.\nThe earbuds have a claimed playback time of up to six hours, while the carrying case can recharge them up to three times.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds will be available in three colourways (Polar Black, Burned Olive, and Metallic Graphite) from 9th April 2024, at a price of \u00a3259.99.\nFind out more here\nLifeSpan Ampera Under Desk Bike lets you exercise as you work\nIt seems like every few months we hear about a new device to keep you fit by allowing you to pedal as you work, but does anyone actually use one long-term, or do they just end up gathering dust\u00a0in a corner?\nThe LifeSpan Ampera Under Desk Bike is designed to power laptops and phones by generating up to 60 watt-hr of electricity when you\u2019re pedalling at 60rpm. You get a 15W wireless charger underneath the saddle that allows you to charge up to two devices simultaneously.\nThe Ampera desk bike is said to be virtually silent in operation thanks to a belt-driven drivetrain.\nThe price? You\u2019re looking at \u00a3899.\nFind out more here\nShhh! Check out this Topsecret hubless e-bike\nSouth Korean brand Topsecret is offering a hubless urban e-bike that has a claimed average range of 80 miles. We\u2019ve seen hubless e-bikes before, including the Reevo back in 2020.\n> Is this hubless e-bike the future? Reevo has storage inside its wheels and 'impenetrable' theft protection\nTopsecret says, \u201cOur self-developed mid-drive motor (750W/48V) provides higher torque and performance compared to conventional hub motors, doubling its power, gaining more benefits from the gear system, and being easier to maintain. [You get] power of over 140Nm from the mid-drive 750W motor.\u201d\nThe Topsecret comes with hydraulic brakes that operate on a disc that sits just inside the inner edge of the wheel rim, and you lights that turn on/off automatically according to ambient light conditions and a black box camera.\nWe don\u2019t yet have a price for this one.\nFind out more here\nMojawa\u2019s HaptiFit Terra bone-conducting earphones also keep your fitness on track\nLike the Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds (above), Mojava\u2019s HaptiFit Terra are designed to provide the audio you'd expect along with a bunch of fitness stuff that you probably wouldn't.\u00a0As well as being bone-conducting earphones, these track your heart rate and monitor your pace, steps, calories, and other metrics. Most unexpected of the lot, you get AI training programmes\u00a0designed to help you get fitter and faster.\nThe HaptiFit Terras come with 32GB of file storage and an IP68 rating, meaning that they\u2019re dust-tight and can be immersed in a metre of water without damage. More to the point, they\u2019ll keep out sweat.\nThese earphones are available to pre-order at a price of \u00a3240.\nFind out more here\nUrtopia: the e-bike you control with a ring\nWe showed you the Urtopia e-bike with ChatGPT artificial intelligence last summer, and the company has now taken things further with the introduction of a smart ring that can be used to connect to the bike and turn it on and off.\n> Is\u00a0Shimano\u00a0planning automatic shifting for the masses? Plus the ChatGPT e-bike (yep, really), Trek, Rapha, Cube + loads more\nUrtopia says it is expanding its ecosystem to include a range of devices to improve the riding biking experience. The smart ring can also monitor your activity and sleep.\nUrtopia says, \u201c[The smart ring] will synchronise the heart rate with our e-bikes, allowing the bike to understand your heart rate and better assist you, providing you with health guidance for the next day based on riding data and sleep data.\u201d\nWhat do you reckon \u2013\u00a0interesting innovation or tech for tech\u2019s sake?\nFind out more here\nValeo updates Cyclee motor-gearbox system\nA bit of sensible news for e-bike aficionados... France\u2019s Valeo has announced the latest update of its Cyclee mid-drive unit for e-bikes, with a new HMI (human-machine interface) and claimed reductions in noise and vibration.\nValeo says, \u201cWith a 7-speed gear automatic transmission and responding with a 130Nm torque - the highest level available on the market - Valeo Cyclee boosts all the rides, even the hardest ones.\u201d\nThe new HMI comprises a smart dock, a 2in touch display, and a remote with a rotative throttle. Using your phone as a key, the e-bike automatically locks when you step two metres away from it. Valeo says that the Cyclee is now quieter than ever too.\nFind out more here\nWe\u2019ve noticed you\u2019re using an ad blocker.

It's \u00a3869 cheaper than the LifeSpan Ampera so I could probably live with the lack of phone charger.\nI happened to see a pedal exerciser in my local mobility shop and was maybe thinking about getting something like that for my home office\nThe problem with your device is the limited market- it's only really useful to e-bike users because only they are accustomed to just moving your feet around in a circular motion without any effort\nThe problem with your device is the limited market- it's only really useful to e-bike users because only they are accustomed to just moving your feet around in a circular motion without any effort\nI'm pretty sure that knob is going to adjust a brake of some sort so it requires some effort. Image search confirms:\u00a0https://relaxdays.co.uk/sport-leisure/fitness/fitness-equipment/exercise...\nVery amusing! Anybody who thinks it's possible to put any effort with your legs into a device like that is the very definition of 'the hard of thinking'. My point still stands.\nThe problem with your device is the limited market- it's only really useful to e-bike users because only they are accustomed to just moving your feet around in a circular motion without any effort\nEbikes are amazing, aren't they? Somehow the 70+% of my 50+kms a day commute when I'm riding faster than 25kmh and so with zero motor assistance requires no effort at all. Incredible.\nI expected you to be along sometime with this 'e-biking is better than ordinary cycling because we carry all that weight aound and hardly use the assistance at all' stuff. This could be true in an individual case, but it doesn't\u00a0apply to any of the e-bikers I see, who I recall as doing sod all (there aren't any around here in winter and I didn't see any today). Time for some data to compare: this is me today, age 71 1/2- now for one of yours in the past week or so!\nIf you remember our previous conversations at all you would remember I've never said anything of the sort, firstly because my road ebike at 15kg weighs a lot less than many people's unpowered bikes (though a lot more than my unpowered road bike, obviously) and secondly because I'm an enthusiastic advocate, and practitioner, of unpowered cycling; I use my ebike for the 50km+ commute, carrying heavy shopping etc and when chronic illness is flaring and it's a choice between ebike or no bike - all things for which otherwise I would have to use a car or public transport. Why can't you just live and let live, people riding ebikes does you no harm in any way whatsoever, let it go.\nNo rides to show I'm afraid, been testing positive for Covid the last nine days so been confined to barracks.\nWhy can't you just live and let live, people riding ebikes does you no harm in any way whatsoever, let it go\nThe problem is you not letting things go, Rendel! That's why many of the topics are cluttered up with you and a collection of obvious nutters fighting it out when the best course would be to refuse to respond. In this case, it\u00a0was\u00a0you not letting it go. My comment was a light-hearted dig at e-bikes, and an obviously no-exercise exercise machine- rather like, as I choose to allege, no-exercise e-bikes, which most of them are. Other people, apart from you, are allowed to make any comment they choose, and yet other people can choose to ignore them. I return to the topic which began all this for me: some MP extolling the benefits of e-bikes because they 'iron out the hills'. When you do that, it takes most of the exercise away- it's not the same as cycling, it's a different activity. Nobody is trying to stop anybody (including nonagenarians, people with bad knees, people who have had cancer etc. etc.) using e-bikes but people are trying to stop me jeering at the great majority of e-bike passengers who use them because it's easier!\nPS Older data will do!\nI'm astonished that you simply took the word of some MP rather than real data or experience.\nI'm astonished that you simply took the word of some MP rather than real data or experience\nI'm doubly astonished that you made up this sentence when the real data I showed below indicates that real cycling is fairly hard work, and my experience in the Lake District, say, is that people on e-bikes in pairs overtake me on hills chatting away while sat upright not labouring at all. It's a more eco-friendly way of going for a drive in the country, so to me they're pretty much the same as all the other powered vehicles going past.\nUmm you are 71.5 and go up hill at 10kph ! Maybe it's time for an ebike for yourself !\nUmm you are 71.5 and go up hill at 10kph ! Maybe it's time for an ebike for yourself !\nNot likely! It wouldn't be up to the job\nYou really need to get a penny farthing. \u00a0Your newfangled safety bicycle, with gears no less is way too easy in the hills and that's not real cycling!!! \u00a0How dare you use newer technology to enjoy bike riding. \u00a0I've decided how much effort you need to put in, so don't you dare do anything I don't approve of.\nDo you see how ridiculous that sounds? \u00a0You are simply making an\u00a0equivalent statement with more modern examples. \u00a0It's great that your focus is to get exercise but that doesn't mean you get to determine what everyone else uses their bike, ebike or anything else for. \u00a0Get over yourself!\n\"I still feel that variable gears are only for people over forty-five. Isn\u2019t it better to triumph by the strength of your muscles than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft\u2026 As for me, give me a fixed gear!\" \u2014 Henri Desgrange\nYou really need to get a penny farthing\nThat's pretty dim! The argument is trivially simple: power assistance v. no power assistance. Cycling is the latter, e-biking the former.\nYou really need to get a penny farthing That's pretty dim! The argument is trivially simple: power assistance v. no power assistance. Cycling is the latter, e-biking the former.\nSo for the 70% of my commute (which equates to around 35 km out of 50) that I'm riding above 25 km/h so getting no power assistance, I'm cycling and so getting the same exercise as anyone on an unpowered bike. Glad to see you've finally got that point straight.\nYou really need to get a penny farthing That's pretty dim! The argument is trivially simple: power assistance v. no power assistance. Cycling is the latter, e-biking the former.\nThe key word in your post is \"assistance\".\u00a0 Yes, the electric motor makes cycling easier, but it is only assisting you, so you are still cycling.\n...and my experience in the Lake District, say, is that people on e-bikes in pairs overtake me on hills chatting away while sat upright not labouring at all. It's a more eco-friendly way of going for a drive in the country, so to me they're pretty much the same as all the other powered vehicles going past.\nThis isn't really \"experience\" of e-bikes is it? Watching other people overtake you on hills while chatting...\nYou should actually try riding an e-bike and you'll find that it's not all sitting up and kicking back. It's definitely exercise in every way. I use an e-bike for commutes to the office. It's only 11km each way, but there's around\u00a0200m (at up to 8%) elevation in the form of the South Dorset Ridgeway in between. Comparing calorie burn from power data on e-bike and bike, the e-bike ride is only about 25% less power & energy. So taking the e-bike instead of driving my van means predictable, repeatable journey\u00a0time as no traffic jam on the hill, I get to enjoy the scenery more yet can travel in office clothes while getting free exercise. While I have no intention of getting rid of my regular bikes, the e-bike has its use cases and utility transport while getting exercise is one of them.\nHere's example data from a commute back in November:\nYou should actually try riding an e-bike\nI think not - things are not yet that bad, despite Hirsute's disparaging remarks about my abilities on hills!\nI think not - things are not yet that bad, despite Hirsute's disparaging remarks about my abilities on hills!\nYou're missing my point - you appear to\u00a0have said that riding an e-bike does not count as exercise, based on watching other people, my point was that it definitely does provide exercise. FWIW, things are \"not that bad\" for me\u00a0either, when I want to go fast and have fun, I can take out the (unpowered) S-Works Venge, but that's absolutely rubbish for commuting or leaving outside a shop. The assisted Vado fulfils that role.\nJust a bit of joshing. I've seen your speeds on your videos you upload. There seems to be one hill where you get close passed a lot\nThere seems to be one hill where you get close passed a lot\nOf course- I go a short distance from A to B and back at least once a day, and that hill takes up most of the distance.

It's just the data to me makes the ride look very easy, more than 25% easier than riding a bike.\nIt's a more eco-friendly way of going for a drive\nThat's how I use my eBike - to undertake journeys that I would otherwise have used a car to do. I'm not sure why you think this is a bad thing.\nI'm burning about 300 calories per hour on my eBike (similar to walking). It's not a huge amount, but it's not insignificant.\nI'm burning about 300 calories per hour on my eBike (similar to walking). It's not a huge amount, but it's not insignificant.\nI get a bit more of a burn because I try to ride over the power cutoff whenever possible, on the commute the motor only really helps with pulling away from lights and a couple of big hills, but yes studies have shown that you will burn considerably more calories than baseline even if just (as wtjs seems to believe all ebike riders do) spinning the pedals. As we say in this house, the money saved on train fares/car expenses pays for the beer and the extra exercise burns it off.\nThe problem is you not letting things go, Rendel!

You frequently post attacks on this website claiming that it is only interested in clickbait and that its reviews are biased in favour of manufacturers who give them advertising (you also, in your more bizarre moments, claim that I am a member of road.cc staff and I'm here just to elicit responses and drive up website traffic).

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The Ultra Series, featuring carbon fiber eMTBs, is a nod to performance and environmental responsibility.\nCustomized Solutions for Diverse Markets:\nHimiway's market expansion plan involves tailoring its offerings to specific regional demands. The Family Series, with its electric cargo bike and electric motorbike, acknowledges the diverse needs of families worldwide. The All-Terrain Series, with upgraded features, caters to the off-road preferences that vary globally. The Discovery Series, focusing on high-end urban commuting, recognizes the distinct requirements of metropolitan environments. This strategic approach allows Himiway to offer customized solutions that resonate with consumers in different parts of the world.\nAddressing Market Demands and Sustainability Challenges\nIn developing our upcoming product lineup, we have meticulously responded to prevailing market demands, reflecting our commitment to meeting consumers' evolving needs and expectations.\nHimiway recognizes the diversity in consumer preferences and lifestyles.
