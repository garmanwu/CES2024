        "raw_content": "Cookie Disclaimer\nBasket Overview\nHyundai Motor Reveals Vision for Hydrogen Energy and Software Solutions Beyond Mobility at CES 2024\nLAS VEGAS, January 8, 2024 \u2013 Hyundai Motor Company today presented its vision for a hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation beyond mobility applications at CES 2024. Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company held its Media Day at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas to highlight its future blueprint for a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a vision for software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn line with Hyundai Motor\u2019s brand vision, \u2018Progress for Humanity,\u2019 the \u2018Ease every way\u2019 theme reflects the company\u2019s aim to create a comfortable and peaceful living environment by providing three core universal values of freedom, safety, and fairness for the global community. It goes beyond the mere physical utility value of technology and caters to the complex daily lives of people, providing freedom from various limitations, safety in communities from software security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through hydrogen, and fair accessibility to clean energy and related services.\n\"At Hyundai, we believe that science and humanity are two sides of the same coin; that advanced technology should also make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Jay Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cClean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, President and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cOur theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\u201d\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO \u00a0from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d\u00a0said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business.\u00a0\u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors. Having seen the real-world applications already being delivered by Hyundai, we\u2019re excited that Georgia is part of Hyundai\u2019s future.\u201d\nSDx: Building a user-centered mobility ecosystem by defining vehicles, fleets and \u00a0transportation systems with software and AI\nHyundai is undergoing a software-driven transformation led by the entire Group. As a provider of smart mobility solutions, Hyundai recognizes the importance of software and AI in creating a user-centric mobility ecosystem. At CES, the company announced its \u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019 (SDx) strategy, which aims to transform all moving devices, fleets and ecosystems into valuable assets through advanced software and AI.\nThrough its SDx strategy, the Group seeks to develop a mobility ecosystem that meets the needs of users anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, the Group is transitioning everything into a software-defined approach, from vehicle development to building the entire mobility ecosystem. It believes software and AI are enablers of achieving this vision through providing holistic user experience without limitations and is dedicated to delivering mobility services and solutions that prioritize convenience and safety.\nThe Group\u2019s strategy begins with developing \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV). This means to incorporate software development methods to automotive development which means to decouple hardware and software to enable independent updates and advancement of each. The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024. Attendees can visit the company\u2019s exhibition booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall, from January 9\u201312.\nThe exhibition revolves around the theme of \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 focusing on a human-centric future to come through the application of hydrogen energy and software technologies. In the entrance, the plastic-to-hydrogen process, in which waste plastic is transformed into clean hydrogen energy, can be seen on a large immersive three-sided display.\nIn the middle of the booth, there are various HTWO Grid solutions and hydrogen value chain demonstration projects on display that span Hyundai Motor Group, including Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Rotem, Hyundai E&C, Hyundai Engineering, Hyundai Glovis and Hyundai Steel.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation. The company is committed to providing optimized hydrogen mobility solutions, building on the foundation of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\nAlso on display, the mobile fuel cell generator supplies electricity solely through the fuel cell stack without the need for additional auxiliary power storage devices. It can be used in various fields and can provide power in emergencies, such as power outages, or challenging environments where accessing another power supply is difficult.\nThe mobile fuel cell generator is actively used in Electric Touring Car Racing (ETCR) competitions. To ensure the seamless operation of high-performance electric vehicles for all participating companies in the competition, Hyundai Motor has established a charging infrastructure using its hydrogen fuel cell system. The racing cars in the ETCR series recharge their batteries using electricity generated by the fuel cell generator produced by the Group.\nNext to the media table, a sectional model displays the operating principle of a portable hydrogen fuel cell generator, allowing a detailed examination of its structure for easy understanding.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram provides environmentally friendly public transportation, contributing to the purification and production of clean air. The hydrogen fuel cell tram is equipped with four hydrogen fuel cells with a capacity of 95 kW and can travel up to 150 km. It purifies approximately 800 \u03bcg of fine dust and produces 107.6 kg of clean air per hour of operation.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram is wireless, which does not require tram overhead lines, improving the aesthetics of the city and reducing infrastructure costs. Hyundai Rotem will continuously expand its lineup, including hydrogen high-speed trains, electric multiple units and locomotives.\nBooth visitors can also learn about how Hyundai Steel is preparing to establish a green steel production system to cut carbon emissions in the steel production process. It aims to reduce both direct and indirect carbon emissions by 12 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBy introducing eco-friendly processes that replace blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces and utilizing hydrogen and renewable energy instead of coal energy, the carbon emissions in the steel production process are significantly reduced.\nHyundai Motor is emphasizing its commitment to realizing the hydrogen vision at the Group level by showcasing a video inside the exhibition booth that explains the hydrogen demonstration projects and core technologies conducted by the group. This effort aims to highlight the company\u2019s ongoing dedication to making the hydrogen vision a reality.\nFostering a paradigm shift with the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019)\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai Motor showcases exhibits and videos introducing core \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) technologies under development by the Group\u2019s global software center, 42dot, emphasizing the importance of software (SW) and AI in becoming a smart mobility solutions provider.\nHyundai Motor aims to redefine everything from vehicles to all surrounding environments with SW and AI, promoting the expansion from SDV to SDx (\u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019). Its CES exhibit highlights the Group\u2019s current practical software-defined mobility services alongside technologies fostering the extension of SDx.\nThe SDV Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Architecture represents the core hardware structure of SDV, showcasing the operational framework and functional structure where the vehicle\u2019s cameras, radars and sensors gather driving environment data, enabling autonomous driving through the integrated controller, a High-Performance Vehicle Computer (HPVC) embedded within the vehicle. This exhibit illustrates how the vehicle\u2019s hardware structure gets simplified through the transition toward SDV, providing a more intuitive view.\nBased on driving scenes in Pangyo, South Korea played on the display in the front of the exhibit, actual road scenarios, such as left and right turns, are staged to illustrate the data flow where the HPVC and zone controllers for autonomous driving are activated according to the road environment. This flow is visualized through LED lights. Moreover, it\u2019s possible to observe the operation of a \u2018fault-tolerant\u2019 function within SDV safety features, where even if one controller malfunctions, another controller takes over to ensure safe driving.\nThe HPVC exhibited alongside the SDV architecture serves as the integrated hardware consolidating core SDV technologies. It controls all other controllers within the SDV, functioning as the brain of the SDV, enabling the application of software technologies in the vehicle. The HPVC aids in driving assistance and acts as a gateway between data generated within the vehicle, facilitating the application of software technologies in the vehicle. It plays a significant role, vastly enhancing the vehicle\u2019s performance, safety and convenience.\nTwo HPVC models developed by 42dot are available at one of the six media tables in the central software section within the booth. These models differ in their cooling methods: one uses air cooling, dissipating heat through air, while the other utilizes liquid cooling with water.\n42dot is not only developing HPVC and controllers but also developing an SDV operating system, SDV OS, to ensure stable and efficient operation of in-vehicle applications. On the additional five media tables positioned to the right and above the HPVC exhibits, visitors can watch videos introducing the five core SDV technologies under development by 42dot and a film of various Group-wide practical software-defined mobility services in motion that are being operated today.\nThe five core technologies introduced through the videos include:\n\u2022HPVC and SDV OS: A modern data center-like network architecture and fault-tolerant system for SDVs\n\u2022Data-Driven Learning Systems: Continuous integration and deployment of autonomous driving from R&D to commercial robo-taxi service through MLOps and DataOps\n\u2022Safety-Designed Vehicle: Technology for cybersecurity and safe driving control\n\u2022LLM for Advanced Mobility: Conversational AI assistant that enhances human-like interaction between SDVs and drivers/passengers\n\u2022Self-Managed Smart City: SDV technologies extending beyond vehicles into the city\nFurthermore, Hyundai Motor displays a video on software-defined mobility services in motion equipped with advanced technologies operated by various companies within the Group. The video features the on-demand shuttle \u2018Shucle\u2019, autonomous mobility platform \u2018TAP!\u2019 and Motional\u2019s IONIQ 5-based autonomous taxi service \u2018Robotaxi\u2019.\nDICE\u318dSPACE\u318dCITY POD: Experience future mobility realizing the human-centered vision\nThe Group will unveil a hydrogen-based mobility service concept that connects everyone\u2019s life, providing an experience of convenience and freedom of movement in line with the vision of \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 as presented at CES 2024.\nIn this exhibition, visitors can explore the Group\u2019s future mobility solutions, spanning from personal mobility to public mobility and logistics, realizing a human-centered vision that extends from individuals to cities.\nDICE (Digital Curated Experience) infused with AI is a personal mobility platform that provides curated services through software technology customized to individuals. Through a display surrounded on three sides, a more immersive mobile experience is possible.\nThe \u2018Ring Pad\u2019 controller, a kinetic interface that is an evolved form of a fixed interface of existing vehicles, allows you to communicate with AI and adjust the environment of DICE. It includes a bio-sensing camera to create an optimized environment and an airbag for safety.\nWhen using DICE for travel, you can receive curated journey suggestions through personal device integration, which considers your schedule, destination and more. In addition, DICE can reroute in response to a sudden change in schedule and activate \u2018Therapy Mode,\u2019 which monitors the user\u2019s condition through continuous bio-sensing.\nHyundai aims to showcase the evolution into a platform with infinite possibilities, going beyond the traditional driver-passenger roles through spatial computing-based interfaces of DICE.\nWhile DICE is about personalized digital experiences during transportation, SPACE (Spatial Curated Experience) is about providing customized spatial experiences by incorporating individual lifestyles into the mobility space to embrace users across a wide spectrum of needs, along with free mobility.\nTo meet the varied needs of passengers, SPACE Mobility provides optimized space and adaptive seats. It also supports wheelchair users, micro-mobility users and pets through comfortable boarding height control.\nAlong with that, booth visitors can enjoy customized content through a large transparent display placed on doors. The AI service agent located in the interior console interacts with users, providing various information needed throughout the journey.\nNot only that, but SPACE also extends to an open area called the \u2018Pavilion\u2019, which is constructed from reused obsolete mobility modules. It is a concept that architecturally reinterprets the life cycle of mobility. It is characterized by the ability to impart various functions and usability to each module.\nIt interacts with the software environment through a hologram interface and provides portable battery slots and various charging modules for sharing energy through a hydrogen fuel cell system. It functions as a hub that connects people, city, robot and mobility, incorporating an air-cleaning algae module and a smart farm that utilizes water from the byproduct of a hydrogen fuel cell, along with a rest area featuring mobility seats.\nAlso on display is CITY POD, an unmanned large-scale mobility system that surpasses the limits of the existing logistics systems based on software. It presents an \u2018automatic logistics sorting system\u2019 that moves organically and actively at all stages.\nCITY POD with hydrogen energy technology adopts a modular system combining Plug & Drive and PnD POD, presenting an efficient and systematic middle mile and last mile logistics vision. Each POD is automatically combined or separated as needed, allowing logistics to be delivered directly to customers not only on the road but also inside buildings.\nHyundai Motor plans to provide a demonstration during CES so that visitors to the exhibition hall can directly experience future mobility.\nIn addition, Hyundai Motor also exhibited \u2018Stretch\u2019, a logistics loading and unloading robot developed by Boston Dynamics. \u2018Stretch\u2019 is an autonomous robot for more efficient and safer logistics operations, mainly helping to empty loaded trailers and shipping containers in warehouses.\nStretch uses AI to make real-time decisions on all boxes and sort logistics according to self-established rules, so it can work without entering additional information in advance. Its main feature is that it can carry boxes weighing up to 50 pounds (approximately 22.7 kg) and can even pick up multiple boxes at once. At the booth, Stretch performs a continuous demonstration of picking up and putting down a box on the floor.\n- END -\nGlobal PR Contents \u00b7 Hyundai Motor Company\n[Appendix]\nLink to web articles on Hyundai\u2019s message and core technologies presented at CES 2024:\n\u2022Main article\nhttps://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/brand-journal/mobility-solution/ces-2024\n\u2022HTWO Grid solution\nhttps://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/innovation/hydrogen-value-chain#section-1\n\u2022SDV technologies\nhttps://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/brand-journal/mobility-solution/sdv\nAbout Hyundai Motor Company\nEstablished in 1967, Hyundai Motor Company is present in over 200 countries with more than 120,000 employees dedicated to tackling real-world mobility challenges around the globe.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

This means that there will be greater equality in the access to, and use of, energy. Just imagine a world where everyday waste is made into clean energy making our living spaces safe, clean, and free from pollution.\nWe are working on software that is optimized for users and guarantees free movement by connecting mobility options and the city in one place. Based on the data that is accumulated, our software can then proactively protect everyone even in dangerous situations.\nHyundai is making this world a reality with our hydrogen energy and software solutions.\nOur passion for hydrogen energy\nHydrogen energy is not a new thing for us. We have always held the belief that hydrogen energy is essential for the future. In fact, here at Hyundai, we have been developing hydrogen vehicles since 1998. That\u2019s 26 years of expertise already.\nIn 2013, we commercialized the world's first mass-produced Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the Tucson iX35 FCEV. We followed this with the launch of the NEXO in 2018 and achieved the top spot worldwide for sales of hydrogen vehicles.\nWith the launch of our hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck XCIENT Fuel Cell in 2020, we have further verified the excellent quality of our hydrogen mobility. Since 2020, our XCIENT Fuel Cell heavy-duty trucks in Switzerland has accumulated 8.7 million kilometers of cumulative driving in real-life customer operation.\nOur preparation for the future, which began with the development of hydrogen vehicles, has now expanded across our entire company. Our next goal is to provide comprehensive hydrogen-related solutions across the entire hydrogen value chain.\nWhat\u2019s more, to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society, we need to start using hydrogen on a larger scale. To this end, we will increase our hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes per year by 2035 and use this to propel a major transformation.\nThe HTWO Grid, end-to-end hydrogen solution\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to a hydrogen energy ecosystem requires a comprehensive solution that is tailored to the different needs of everyone who needs to use it.\nOur answer is HTWO Grid, an end-to-end hydrogen solution where the capabilities of every affiliate intersect at all stages of hydrogen production from storage and transportation to utilization. This will even offer customized solutions optimized for various environments and physical characteristics through its organic combinations and connections between each technology.\nWe already have different hydrogen solution packages in the United States and are under discussion with Indonesia on a waste-to-hydrogen production focused solution package. Especially, the Clean Logistics Project that will officially launch in the second half of 2024 is expected to drive a hydrogen society in Georgia. We plan to provide our solution to different regions, thus accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society in the future.\nTurning everyday waste into energy\nThe best-known method of producing clean hydrogen is water electrolysis, which produces hydrogen by splitting water. However, the availability of water is different from region to region. So, we became interested in ways to turn waste generated in everyday life into hydrogen.\nWaste-to-energy technology, which we introduced at CES 2024, is a technology that converts sewage, food waste, livestock manure, and plastic waste that is concerned as a headache to all countries.\nWaste-to-energy technology is largely divided into two types. Firstly, waste-to-hydrogen technology is a method that decomposes organic waste with microorganisms to generate biogas and convert this into hydrogen. Secondly, plastic-to-hydrogen technology is a method of obtaining hydrogen by gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements. Hyundai Motor Group is already in action to produce hydrogen from biogas in Chungju city in Korea.\nBoth technologies have a double positive effect (win-win) as they fix two problems: they can obtain clean hydrogen energy while reducing the waste around us.\nProviding freedom to move through software and AI\nBeyond vehicles, we are also expanding into SDx which means \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d. This means redefining vehicles, fleets, transportation system and beyond, with software and AI.\nWe aspire to create a user-centred, safer, and more convenient mobility ecosystem through software and AI, because they allow everything to be connected without the constraints of time and space.\nThe first thing we\u2019ve been working on is a shift in development. When a \u201csoftware-defined\u201d approach is applied to automobiles, all features can be designed and updated based on user\u2019s mobility journey.\nSoftware can quickly improve the vehicle's user experience and safety features, driving performance, and app services. It can even define a vehicle\u2019s entire identity.\nSo through software and AI, we want to connect mobility, logistics solutions with devices and city operations systems, and transform the way the world moves. Hyundai see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation.\nThe whole SDx journey is driven by the values of convenience and safety, which have always been a priority for Hyundai Motor Group. Using software to fulfill our \u201cService-defined, Safety-designed\u201d philosophy will help us strengthen and evolve these values even more.\nDreaming of a new mobility ecosystem with our vision for SDx\nOur vision for SDx begins with SDV (software-defined vehicle). For this, we plan to incorporate software development practice into vehicle development, allowing independent updates and advancement of software and hardware. This increases agility and scalability of vehicle development, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nWith the spread of SDVs in the market, data and platforms will be increasingly connected therefore management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Hyundai will expand its software solutions to business customers and provide insights, by enabling optimal operation and management of vehicles, and real-time data analytics to issues for fleet operators.\nAs vehicles and fleets get defined and developed by software, they will eventually become AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers. Through automated and autonomous development, improvement and updates of devices and solutions, mobility in general will become efficient and accessible, adding value for users.\nHyundai is dreaming where HMG's various software technologies and platforms are combined to lay the foundation for a \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019, where an entire self-operating urban transportation system is connected and run through software and AI.\nUsers will be provided with transportation-as-a-service, all any mobility and logistics solutions needed in time. With all software-defined HMG devices, from vehicles to AAM, robotics to smart factories, all connected within the mobility ecosystem seamlessly.\nOpening up infinite possibilities with Hyundai\u2019s future mobility\nAt CES 2024, we introduced our future mobility concept with roots in hydrogen, software fused with robotics technology to ease our lives in every way. We are expanding \u201cmovement\u201d beyond limitations, here are some of the things you can look forward to seeing from us in the future.\nDICE (Digital Curated Experience)\nSoftware combined with AI technology offers a whole new mobility experience. For example, DICE is a personal mobility concept that delivers a personalized curated experience, which makes the time spent moving more valuable.\nDICE linked with AI recognizes you anytime, anywhere, and provides optimized services. It can also be connected with a personal device to create a customized environment. DICE\u2019s three-sided Transparent OLED create immersive personalized experiences. The ring pad controller, a kinetic interface that is an evolved form of the \u2018fixed interface\u2019 dashboard of existing vehicles, allows you to communicate with AI and adjust the environment of DICE. DICE can process individual preferences and movement environments to deliver a continuous curation of optimized content even while you\u2019re enroute.\nSPACE (Spatial Curated Experience)\nThe development of software technology has opened a wide spectrum of possibilities for space within mobility. SPACE, social mobility concept, is based on inclusivity and circularity. It embraces diverse needs with inclusive and social value, providing free movement and customized spatial experiences for all.\nSPACE \u2013 Mobility: This multi-seater public mobility system gives everyone, including people with mobility impairments, unrestricted access to travel experiences. The interior space is reinterpreted as a personalized space supported by autonomous driving, AI and \u2018Adaptive Seat\u2019 stored within the walls. Boarding height control allows easy boarding of wheelchairs and provides the perfect solution for last mile mobility for you, your pets and any other guests.\nSPACE \u2013 Pavilion: Obsolete SPACE modules are reinterpreted as architectural elements and reassembled into the shape of a pavilion, offering inclusive usability even to disadvantaged areas. It features a Hologram Interface for communicating with the software environment. The hydrogen energy system supports portable battery slots and various charging modules, providing smart farms and air-cleaning algae modules using water by-products. The seats provide a space to rest. SPACE-Pavilion is a physical hub connecting people with the city, robots, and mobility.\nCITY POD\nWe also offer future logistics that grant mobility solutions that go beyond the limits of the current logistics system and move freely and organically at every stage. CITY POD is capable of a digital twin control that was systematically organized both above and below ground utilizing AI. It also offers logistics within the city, leveraging future technologies such as Crab walk and autonomous driving to maximize efficiency. It provides a diverse range of uses not only in logistics but also in future life and industrial sites, including public transportation, industrial material and waste transportation, hydrogen energy transportation, and automatic refueling support.\nStretch\nStretch is our versatile, autonomous robot for safer and more efficient warehouse operations. Today, Stretch is out in the real world, unloading floor-loaded trailers and shipping containers on behalf of humans. In the next few years, Stretch will become a multi-purpose case-handling robot that will enable the lights-out warehouse of the future. Soon after, Stretch may be able to handle a variety of manipulation tasks, even outside of the warehouse. These robots are exceptional, intelligent machines that enrich people\u2019s lives by protecting humans from dangerous, repetitive, and physically challenging activities.\nThe dawn of a new world\nAlthough both hydrogen energy and software are invisible, they are like the air that exists all around us. Here at Hyundai, we are bringing positive changes to the world by combining the capabilities of our companies and realizing the full potential of hydrogen and software.\nThis new pathway will make all our lives more comfortable, and it will make our world cleaner and safer. We are more than a mobility company. We are changing the environment in which we live in and bringing \u2018Progress for Humanity\u2019.

And following a fall product launch season that was as intense as any we've ever seen in the tech ecosystem, CES 2024 is set to explode with a ton of announcements about real products that are coming in the months ahead.\nIn other words, you can expect to see a lot fewer of the CES experiments and flights-of-fancy of the past dominating the headlines this year, because there are so many interesting and useful new things to crowd them out.\nSpecial Feature\nCES 2024\nEach year, CES reveals new product trends that transform the future of work and life. ZDNET will sort through the wave of news and announcements to find the innovations that will matter most to professionals.\nZDNET has already been pre-briefed on many of the best products that are coming, and we're looking forward to sharing our first impressions, original photos and videos, and buying advice. Our team will be on the ground at CES as well as covering it broadly from multiple time zones. We'll highlight the products we're most excited about, the trends that are taking shape from the show, and the latest innovations most likely to shape the future.\nTo put it all in context, here are the three themes that will make the biggest impact at this year's CES.\n1. AI clouds everything\nAny product that includes an algorithm, machine learning, or automation of any kind is going to be marketed as an AI-powered product at CES 2024. Make no mistake, there will be plenty of AI-washing, as companies vie with each other to ride the generative AI wave. ZDNET will help you cut through the AI marketing cacophony to learn the best AI innovations coming to products in 2024. Fortunately, there are a ton of potential benefits to look forward to -- from products and features that will automatically translate audio and text from different languages to TV hardware that will improve upscaling of low-res content for today's amazing 4K and 8K displays to truly time-saving automations in the products you use every day.\n2. VR, AR, and XR prep for a big year\nThe metaverse may have been dud, but mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) are surging on a new wave of interest -- thanks in large part to Apple's Vision Pro announcement, which has put the spotlight on the next generation of immersive digital experiences. You can get an excellent taste of these today in the Meta Quest 3, ZDNET's 2023 product of the year. And CES 2024 will feature new hardware and experiences that will push it to the next level. We're expecting announcements about headsets that will use Qualcomm's new XR2+ Gen2 VR chip, new sensors and software that will extend what today's headsets and experiences can do, and the latest updates on how all kinds of organizations -- from health care to astronauts to law enforcement to architects to product designers -- are now relying on VR and XR to do critical parts of their work every day. Of course, all of this is a prelude to the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, the arrival of the Samsung/Google XR headset, and a tidal wave of new experiences from developers who will take advantage of these immersive digital platforms.\n3. 100-inch TVs lead a wave of innovation\nTVs are back at the center of innovation at this year's show -- and leaps forward in display technology are making an even bigger and broader impact across the tech industry. From OLED to Mini-LED to Laser TV (projectors), there's a new explosion of innovation and competition that's making content more exciting than ever to consume. Nothing says CES like 100-inch TVs, and we're going to see a lot of them at CES 2024. A new generation of 100-inch TVs is coming to market that won't break the bank or your back. We can't wait to show you the latest TVs and home entertainment products that are coming and we'll offer analysis and buying advice on which ones could transform and level up\u00a0the way you experience content in 2024.\nStay tuned to ZDNET to cut through the fluff and find the stuff that's worth your attention at CES 2024.\nRelated\nThe 5 biggest headphones trends that you'll be hearing more about in 2024\n2024 in tech: The true winners next year will be the companies that do this\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?"

Please try a different type of web browser.\nEnter the New Era of Mobile AI With Samsung Galaxy S24 Series\nEmpowering everyday experiences, from barrier-free communication to awe-inspiring creativity to the power for even more possibilities, Galaxy AI transforms the iconic S series for the future\nSamsung Electronics today unveiled the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy S24+ and Galaxy S24, unleashing new mobile experiences with Galaxy AI.1 Galaxy S series leads the way into a new era that will forever change how mobile devices empower users. AI amplifies nearly every experience on Galaxy S24 series, from enabling barrier-free communication with intelligent text and call translations, to maximizing creative freedom with Galaxy\u2019s ProVisual Engine, to setting a new standard for search that will change how Galaxy users discover the world around them.\n\u201cThe Galaxy S24 series transforms our connection with the world and ignites the next decade of mobile innovation,\u201d said TM Roh, President and Head of Mobile eXperience (MX) Business at Samsung Electronics. \u201cGalaxy AI is built on our innovation heritage and deep understanding of how people use their phones. We\u2019re excited to see how our users around the world empower their everyday lives with Galaxy AI to open up new possibilities.\u201d\nMake Everyday Experiences Epic\nGalaxy AI introduces meaningful intelligence aimed at enhancing every part of life, especially the phone\u2019s most fundamental role: communication. When you need to defy language barriers, Galaxy S24 makes it easier than ever. Chat with another student or colleague from abroad. Book a reservation while on vacation in another country. It\u2019s all possible with Live Translate2, two-way, real-time voice and text translations of phone calls within the native app. No third-party apps are required, and on-device AI keeps conversations completely private.\nWith Interpreter, live conversations can be instantly translated on a split-screen view so people standing opposite each other can read a text transcription of what the other person has said. It even works without cellular data or Wi-Fi.\nFor messages and other apps, Chat Assist can help perfect conversational tones to ensure communication sounds as it was intended: like a polite message to a coworker or a short and catchy phrase for a social media caption.3 AI built into Samsung Keyboard can also translate messages in real-time in 13 languages.4 In the car, Android Auto5 will automatically summarize incoming messages and suggest relevant replies and actions, like sending someone your ETA, so you can stay connected while staying focused on the road.\nOrganization also gets a big boost with Note Assist6in Samsung Notes, featuring AI-generated summaries, template creation that streamlines notes with pre-made formats, and cover creation to make notes easy to spot with a brief preview. For voice recordings, even when there are multiple speakers, Transcript Assist7 uses AI and Speech-to-Text technology to transcribe, summarize and even translate recordings.\nCommunication isn\u2019t the only way Galaxy S24 series takes the fundamental benefits of the phone into the future. Online search has transformed nearly every aspect of life. Galaxy S24 marks a milestone in the history of search as the first phone to debut intuitive, gesture-driven Circle to Search8 with Google. To give Galaxy users an incredible new tool, Galaxy turned to the worldwide leader of search, Google, and opened up new forms of discovery with a simple gesture. With a long press on the home button, users can circle, highlight, scribble on, or tap anything on Galaxy S24\u2019s screen to see helpful, high-quality search results. Seeing a beautiful landmark in the background of a friend\u2019s social media post or a surprising fun fact on YouTube Shorts can quickly become an accurate search to learn more \u2013 without having to leave that app. And depending on a user\u2018s location, for certain searches, generative AI-powered overviews can provide helpful information and context pulled together from across the web, and users can ask more complex and nuanced questions. It\u2019s that easy. And that epic.\nUnleash Creativity to Discover the World in New Ways\nGalaxy S24 series\u2019s ProVisual Engine9 is a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools that transform image capturing abilities and maximize creative freedom every step of the way, from setting up a shot all the way to sharing it on social. Gone are shaky, pixelated images taken from far away. Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s Quad Tele System, with new 5x optical zoom lens, works with the 50MP sensor to enable optical-quality performance at zoom levels from 2x, 3x, 5x to 10x10 magnification thanks to Adaptive Pixel Sensor. Images also show crystal clear results at 100x with enhanced digital zoom.\nWith upgraded Nightography capabilities, photos and videos shot on Galaxy S24 Space Zoom are brilliant in any conditions, even when zoomed in. Capture more light in dim conditions with Galaxy S24 Ultra\u2019s larger pixel size, now 1.4 \u03bcm, which is 60% bigger11\u00a0compared to the previous model. Blur is reduced on Galaxy S24 Ultra with wider optical image stabilizer (OIS) angles and enhanced hand-shake compensation. When recording videos, both front and rear cameras are equipped with Dedicated ISP Block for noise reduction, and Galaxy S24 analyzes gyro information to distinguish between the filmer\u2019s movement and the subject\u2019s. This allows more effective noise removal and clear videos in the dark, even from far away.\nAfter great shots are captured, innovative Galaxy AI editing tools enable simple edits like erase, re-compose, and remaster. For easier and more efficient optimizations, Edit Suggestion12uses Galaxy AI to suggest perfectly suitable tweaks for each photo. To give users even more creative control and freedom, Generative Edit13can fill in parts of an image background with generative AI. When a picture is crooked, AI will fill in the borders. When an object needs to be slightly moved to be in the perfect position, AI lets users adjust the position of the subject and generates a perfectly blended background in its original spot. Anytime Galaxy S24 deploys generative AI to amplify an image, a watermark will appear on the image and in metadata. And if an action-packed video needs to be slowed down, new Instant Slow-mo can generate additional frames based on movements to smoothly slow down action-packed moments for a more detailed look.\nTo ensure every image stuns at every stage, Super HDR reveals lifelike previews before the shutter is ever pressed. And while capturing memories is an essential phone feature, sharing memories with the world is just as meaningful.
