Learn more here.\nCES 2024: Can Holoconnects\u2019 3D holograph boxes be the next-gen of programmed responsiveness?\nHolobox by Holoconnects, featured at CES 2024, goes beyond holographic gimmicks. It's reshaping advertising, transforming healthcare with detailed patient assessments, and enhancing hospitality experiences. The technology unlocks limitless possibilities, akin to the revolution smartphones brought 15 years ago.\nHolographs have been a staple of the future ever since the first sci-fi movies showed them way back whenever. Ever since then they\u2019ve captivated minds and techies have been trying to come up with cool and convincing ways of making it work.\nRelated: Check out all of our latest CES 2024 coverage here.\nFor a while, we seemed to have given up on holographic, relying more on CGI on account of we were getting most of our entertainment through screens anyway, but then, in 2012 at Coachella, Tupac made a holographic appearance that led a lot of us to question whether or not he had really died. Unfortunately, he did, but that just goes to show you what holographic technology had been doing all that time.\nWell, since then, 12 years have passed, and Holoconnects has taken up the torch in the world of holographics with their latest and greatest with Holobox, currently showcased at CES 2024.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look and see if we can tell immersive graphics from reality and find out what all the fuss is about.\nInstead of going with the gimmick, Holobox blazes the trail on the practical uses of holographics while having a bit of fun. As it turns out, there\u2019s more than one application for the new tech.\nRedefined Advertising With Holobox\nFor the advertisement industry, the arrival of Holobox ushers in an era of immersive and impactful brand experiences. It offers a mechanism for advertisers to create captivating 3D representations of products or messages, ensuring memorable interactions that can significantly boost brand recognition and engagement.\nI challenge you to forget the time a holographic person tried selling you a soda, go ahead, give it a try, I know I can\u2019t.\nHolography in Healthcare\nIn the realm of health technology, the Holobox is revolutionizing medical practices by introducing an innovative solution for healthcare professionals to actively participate in patient assessments and contribute valuable insights to potential surgeries. The holographic interfaces play a pivotal role in offering a more immersive and detailed perspective on patient data, empowering medical experts to conduct thorough assessments. One of the key advantages lies in the ability for professionals to remotely collaborate, enabling experts from diverse locations to virtually engage in patient intakes and share their expertise.\nThe Future of Hospitality\nIn terms of the hospitality industry, the Holobox is emerging as an innovative solution to enhance guest experiences. It offers a new way to provide concierge services, display hotel amenities, or even to act as a virtual tour guide.\nWould be nice next time I\u2019m walking around the hotel that used to be a mansion trying to find breakfast in the morning after a hangover\u2026oh don\u2019t act like you haven\u2019t been there.\nReally what the Holobox has done is more than what it\u2019s done. It\u2019s given us the equivalent of paper and pen with the freedom to come up with the new application for this incredible tech. You really are only limited with your own mind when it comes to this thing, so yeah, maybe we\u2019re witnessing the new revolution similar to smartphones 15 years ago, we might have a new take on reality, and yeah, i\u2019m ready for it.\n5 Smart home gadgets launched at CES 2024 you\u2019ll want to buy right now\nCenter Cam V2.0 review: this middle-screen webcam takes up less display real estate\nSkwheel One electric ski review: feel like you\u2019re gliding\u2014but without the snow\nCES 2024: will.i.am and Mercedes AMG flipped the charts with this futuristic automotive tech\nTransparent displays at CES 2024\u2013LG vs Samsung\nSmart thermostats your home needs before winter steps in\nMacBook Pro with M1 Max and M1 Pro: which one should you buy?\nLaunching a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign soon?

Holograms are no longer limited to sci-fi movies and may be in your future sooner than you think with the Holobox.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAt CES Unveiled, a press-only pre-show event, Holoconnects showcased its AI-powered holographic solution, Holobox. The box, similar to a phone booth, can display a full-sized holographic rendering of the person you are talking to with nearly no latency, making it feel like a normal conversation.\nI had the chance to talk to Andre Smith, CEO of Holoconnects, via the Holobox at the event. Even though he was in Amsterdam, and I was 5,000 plus miles away in Las Vegas, it felt like I was talking to him in person, being able to carry out a regular conversation with the typical pauses. You can view a snippet of my experience below.\nFor me to see a hologram of him, he had to be well-lit with a white background. Since I was standing in the showroom without the proper background and lighting, he couldn't see a hologram of me but rather a camera shot, similar to a Zoom call.\nAlthough it seems like super advanced technology, the only things the Holobox needs to function are electricity and the internet, making it a \"plug and play\" system.\nAlso:\u00a0The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nSome other features of the box are anti-glare glass, two HiFi built-in speakers, an 86\" transparent LCD screen, and an advanced touch system.\nAccording to Holoconnects, many companies are already harnessing the technology, including UNICEF, the United Nations, Nike, Vodafone, BMW, Deloitte, and T-Mobile.\nThe company also offers a desktop version of Holobox Mini technology. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\nRelated\nThe 15 best robots and AI tech we saw at CES 2024\nThe best CES 2024 tech you can buy right now\nI demoed Xreal's AR glasses for spatial computing and they're better than I expected"

This company is dazzling the attendees of CES 2024 with its lifelike, highly advanced hologram technology, which can create 3D holographic visualizations of people, products, or logos.\nThe company's products are Holobox, the Modular Holobox, and the Holobox Mini, which can project holograms of anything you want, such as yourself, your favorite celebrity, or your brand logo. The devices are very easy to use; you need electricity and the internet to bring holograms to any location. They also have a touch system, so you can interact with and control the holograms.\nThe Holobox and the Holobox Mini are available in black, white, or a custom design and offer immersive and interactive experiences that deliver unparalleled engagement and impact. The Modular Holobox is designed for Google/Android and can be customized to fit any space or need, such as creating bigger holograms of cars or animals.\nHoloconnects\nHoloconnects' holographic technology has numerous applications across various industries, including hospitality, advertising, education, entertainment, and more.\n\"We thrive on pushing the boundaries of innovation, transforming the ordinary into something extraordinary,\" said Andr\u00e9 Smith, founder and CEO of Holoconnects. \"We believe our technology will profoundly impact all industry sectors and contribute to a more sustainable, fossil-free world, as speakers can be live beamed to any Holobox location, reducing CO2 emissions caused by air travel. CES provides an excellent platform for us to connect with the world's leading innovators and showcase the limitless possibilities of holograms.\"\nInteresting Engineering's interaction with Holoconnects at CES 2024\nDuring our visit to CES 2024, we had the opportunity to interview Marc Hiemstra, a sales team member at Holoconnects, and ask him some questions about the company and its products. Marc told us about their three products, the Holobox, the Modular Holobox, and the Holobox Mini, which can project holograms of any image, such as people, products, or logos. He explained that their products are very easy to use and only require electricity and internet to bring holograms anywhere.\nWhen asked about their holographic technology use cases, Marc mentioned various industries, including hospitality, advertising, education, and entertainment, where their products can be utilized. He gave examples like creating virtual hosts or receptionists in the hospitality industry and live or pre-recorded holograms of speakers, celebrities, or experts in education and entertainment.\nMarc also talked about their clients and partners who are already using their technology in various ways, including UNICEF and CERF, who have partnered with Holoconnects to create holograms that raise awareness and support for their causes. D&B The Facility Group and CIC Hospitality also use their products as virtual hosts and hotel receptionists.\nWhen asked about the difference between their technology and other avatars or virtual characters available in the market, Marc explained that their technology creates realistic and interactive holograms. Their holograms are designed to capture the appearance, voice, and gestures of the person or object being projected, and they also have a 3D effect.\nRegarding competition in the holographic market, Marc confirmed that they have competitors, but he believes that Holoconnects has the best technology and price. Their products are more affordable and scalable than their competitors. They also offer customization options, such as the Modular Holobox, which can create bigger holograms of cars or animals.\nMarc informed us that they have already entered the US market and have an office in Miami, which started a few months ago. They are also launching their latest Modular Holobox innovation at CES 2024. This product combines multiple Holoboxes to create bigger and better holograms.\nFinally, Marc shared that the company has experienced significant growth since its inception three years ago. They have 25 employees and are growing more than 100% every year. Holoconnects has also expanded its market reach and has clients and partners all over the world. They are proud of their achievements and excited about the future."

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "AI Mario at CES 2024: Meet the Hologram That Nintendo Fans Can\u2019t Stop Talking About\nTable of Contents\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas had a surprise guest: Mario, the iconic video game character from Nintendo. But this was not the cheerful and friendly Mario that fans know and love. This was a creepy AI Mario, a hologram that spoke in a strange voice and gave bizarre answers to questions.\nHow AI Mario Came to Be\nThe AI Mario hologram was created by Proto, a company that develops hologram communications software. According to our reporter Taylor Lyles, who witnessed the spectacle on the show floor, Proto used a combination of voice recognition and AI technology to make the hologram listen and respond to attendees.\nHowever, the result was far from convincing. The AI Mario had a noticeable off-brand Italian accent, awkward mouth movements, and stiff posture. It was clear that this was not an official Nintendo product, as the Japanese company is known to be very strict about how its characters are used and portrayed.\nThe Mystery of the Target Logo\nThe AI Mario was not the only hologram that Proto displayed at CES 2024. Other images and real people, including the CEO of AARP, were also shown on the hologram box. But what was the connection between Proto, AARP, and Mario?\nSome attendees, such as @ProbChild_ and @raystrazdas, reported that they were asked by an AARP representative (not Proto) at the booth to ask Mario how to buy a game. The AI Mario replied (in his unsettling deep voice) by suggesting they look online at Target dot com. Moreover, the hologram had a small Target logo in the bottom corner, which was not present in the other demonstrations.\nIt seems that Proto was demonstrating its hologram AI technology for potential partnerships with retailers like Target and that it could be used as an AI assistant in stores. The AI Mario was apparently a gimmick to attract attention to the booth, but it also raised questions about the legality and ethics of using Nintendo\u2019s intellectual property without permission.\nNintendo and AARP Disavow AI Mario\nWe contacted Nintendo, Proto, and Target for comments on the AI Mario situation, but only Proto responded. The company issued a statement to IGN, confirming that neither Nintendo nor AARP were involved in the \u201cinadvertent\u201d showing of AI Mario. The statement read:\n\u201cThe AI hologram animation briefly seen today is an unfinished proof of concept tested for a client to demonstrate technological capabilities and innovation. It is not intended for commercial release. AARP and Nintendo were not involved in the inadvertent showing today. The fact that so many gamers of the world have taken notice shows that they are the best fans in the world and we salute them.\u201d\nA Poor Imitation of Nintendo\u2019s Past Work\nThe AI Mario incident was not only creepy but also disappointing for Nintendo fans. It reminded them of the times when Nintendo had actually done something similar, but much better. In the past, Nintendo had used the voice of Charles Martinet, the official voice actor of Mario and Luigi, to make the characters talk in real time to people at events like New York Comic Con and Nintendo New York. The difference was that Martinet was hidden somewhere off-camera, listening and responding to questions in a natural and authentic way.\nThe AI Mario hologram was a poor imitation of Nintendo\u2019s past work and a disrespectful use of its beloved character. We hope that Nintendo will take action to protect its intellectual property and that Proto will learn from its mistakes and respect the rights of other creators.\nWhat is the history of hologram technology?\nHologram technology is the science of creating and displaying three-dimensional images using light interference patterns.\u00a0The history of hologram technology can be traced back to the late 1940s, when Dennis Gabor, a Hungarian-British physicist, invented the principle of holography while trying to improve the resolution of electron microscopes.\u00a0He coined the term hologram from the Greek words \u201cholos\u201d (whole) and \u201cgramma\u201d (message).\nHowever, optical holography, which uses visible light to create holograms, did not become feasible until the invention of the laser in 1960. The laser provided a coherent and monochromatic light source that was essential for producing clear and stable holograms. The first optical hologram was made by Yuri Denisyuk, a Soviet scientist, in 1962. He used a reflection hologram technique, which allows the hologram to be viewed under white light from the same side as the light source.\nFeatured Insights\nFollow Us\nCategories\nTags\n\u00a9 2024 NetTantra Technologies.

It will also be able to beam in colleagues from the university\u2019s London campus.\nProto\u2019s holographic display will be used to present 3D objects for closer inspection where they can be rotated and studied in detail. Students will also be able to showcase their own outputs to broader audiences with the display.\nPre-recorded messages and talks from industry partners and alumni are on the agenda, too, together with interactive guidance and information for prospective students, parents and guardians, provided by an AI avatar.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Prof Vikki Locke, director of undergraduate studies at Loughborough business school, said students \u201cabsolutely love\u201d the technology and have been begging for selfies with the gadget. They would prefer \u201ca guest speaker from industry beaming into a classroom to a 2D person on the wall\u201d, she added.\nZoom calls led students to \u201cfeel like they were watching TV \u2026 there\u2019s a distance. A holographic image is a lot more engaging and real to them.\u201d\n\u201cEducation has always been a key use case as we developed the Proto platform,\u201d said\u00a0David Nussbaum, inventor and CEO of Proto Inc. \u201cIn Loughborough we have a perfect partner to show all the ways the technology can boost education, in an environmentally sound way, for the first time in England.\u201d\nProto holographic display booths were adopted by the University of Central Florida in 2021 to support medical education, supported by a $75,0000 grant from a US health services provider.\nThe company has also recently unveiled a platform aimed at the retail industry, combining its holographic display with conversational AI capabilities.\nYou may also like this\nSign up for regular updates and get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox.
