The system uses energy from renewable sources such as the sun and wind and combines these with stored energy from batteries and fossil fuel. The system is controlled by a computer to provide ships with power that is operationally efficient, quiet, and environmentally friendly. The Solar Sailor technology is now being adapted for a variety of marine applications such as eco-tourism, tourism, urban transport, leisure and cargo ships. The Solar Sailor technology has been proven in a commercial tourist vessel with operation of the 100-passenger Sydney Solar Sailor since June 2000 by Captain Cook Cruises on Sydney Harbour. The Solar Sailor Hybrid Power System is superior to conventional marine power in terms of lower operating costs (fuel savings and maintenance), zero water pollution, significant reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and greater passenger comfort through reduced noise, vibration and noxious odour emissions. The Hybrid Power System is so efficient because;Incorporates free solar and wind power abundant on the water. No gearboxes;No auxillary generators;Always generator at optimum revs/efficiency;Since its launch, the Sydney Solar Sailor and the Solar Sailor\u00ae concept have received a number of industry awards for design, environmental attributes and technology.
