        "raw_content": "Emerging Tech\nEmerging Tech\nComputing\nInternet\nIT\nMobile Tech\nSecurity\nTechnology\nNewsletters\n10 Products From CES 2024 That Set the Innovation Bar\nI\u2019m still digging through the massive number of announcements from CES earlier this month, and I found 10 products that set the bar for innovation. These are products that I\u2019ve considered buying because they are cool or address a problem that I find compelling.\nI\u2019ll close with my Product of the Week: an app and emergency preparedness kit from Perci that may come in handy for managing the increasing number of weather-related events that hamper our lives during global climate change.\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the most innovative products from CES 2024. I\u2019ll leave off robots, which I covered in depth last week.\nThe Revolutionary Nimo PC\nI think the current generation of PCs has run its course, and it\u2019s time to step back and rethink personal computing, given the breakthrough in cloud computing, head-mounted displays, and Bluetooth technology.\nThe Nimo 1 Core is a PC the size of a mouse. It uses the Qualcomm XR2 solution designed specifically for spatial computing, and it will work with either the Nimo 1 or the Rokid Max glasses. The cost for this tiny computer is $399 without the glasses.\nI\u2019d argue that this is the first personal computer primarily designed for cloud applications because it uses a unique operating system.\nThis solution will compete with the Apple Vision Pro at a small fraction of the price.\nWith a wireless foldable keyboard and a small wireless mouse coupled with the head-mounted display, this PC provides the potential for a mobile, virtual 50-inch display in a pocket-sized solution.\nI think PCs like this are the future. They aren\u2019t the present yet, but Nimo is working to change that.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you are like me, you travel a lot and experience the pain of carrying both a laptop and a tablet. You bring both because you use the PC for work and the tablet to watch movies, so you don\u2019t run out of battery for work, and because there isn\u2019t much room for a laptop flying in coach. In addition, you can continue to use a tablet on takeoff and landing but not the laptop.\nThis dual-device approach, however, means that even if you are TSA Pre, you must pull out one of the devices because they can\u2019t scan two large devices very well when going through security. You want one device that can do both things.\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid PC does both. It\u2019s a Qualcomm-powered tablet married to an Intel laptop, providing a modular device with solid Android performance in tablet mode and decent Intel performance in PC mode in one device.\n(Images Credit: Lenovo)\nSince it is one device, you shouldn\u2019t have to pull it out when going through security, and you can use the table portion of the device to watch content during takeoff and landing. This design may be the ideal solution for combining the functionalities of both a tablet and a PC without compromising either in one integrated device.\nClicks Creator Keyboard\nBack when smartphones first came to market, they had keyboards, so we didn\u2019t have the problems we now have with distracted driving. With keyboards, you could learn how to type by feel.\nI got kicked off of the \u201cToday\u201d show during the iPhone\u2019s launch by arguing that kids who have attention issues would get into accidents because they would try to use their iPhones when driving \u2014 which clearly not only turned out to be true but applied to adults, as well, resulting in new laws and many accidents.\nWhen added to an iPhone, the Clicks creator keyboard makes the iPhone far safer because it turns the iPhone into a BlackBerry-like device with a keyboard.\nThe Clicks keyboard frees up to 50% more screen space for apps and content viewing by replacing the iPhone\u2019s on-screen typing area. (Image Credit: Clicks Technology)\nNot only does this significantly speed up how fast you can text, but you can also text by feel, reducing the need to look at your phone screen while texting.\nYou still shouldn\u2019t do this while driving, but if you do, you are more likely to survive the experience than you would with a typical screen phone. It is funny that it highlights that we never should have moved from keyboards to screen phones in the first place.\nCurrent Dual-Zone Electric Grill\n(Image Credit: Current Backyard)\nIf you are like me, you have a propane grill and must deal with having to rush out to buy propane when you want to BBQ. Not only is it a pain, but the darn tanks tend to roll around when you\u2019re driving and do ugly things to your trunk, the back of your car, or, in my case, my SUV. They are heavy when full, they can explode and represent a fire hazard, and in the winter, they are a real pain to replace. However, electric grills just can\u2019t do the job that a propane grill can \u2014 until now.\nThe Current outdoor grill appears to have the benefits of a propane grill, but it\u2019s electric and has smart features that help make you a better cook. It looks cool, too, which is why it is on my short list of things to buy for summer, and I\u2019m looking forward to retiring my propane grill. It is due out in February, and I\u2019m on the early order list as I want to say goodbye to propane. I like the dual-zone version with the cabinet best.\nBarsys 360 Robotic Bartender\nI have two robotic bartenders, one from Black and Decker, but the Barsys 360 robotic bartender is better looking than either of them, and it better integrates with a smartphone application.\nYou load it with up to three ingredients, and based on what you load into the machine, the app will give you a list of drinks you can make. It doesn\u2019t have a carbonator, but the robotic bartender I own that has one was discontinued mainly because of problems with that system.\nHere\u2019s the CES demo for the Barsys 360:\nNote that it has a built-in mixer, which neither of my existing robotic bartenders has.\nI\u2019m on the list for one of these, but given I already have two robotic bartenders, I\u2019m not sure I want or need a third. I expect that if I got this one, I\u2019d lose the two I already have, as it looks a ton better and is more advanced than the ones I currently own. It reminds me a little bit of a newer version of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d replicator.\nSkyted Voice Silencer Mask\nIf you know what you are doing, you can receive and make calls on some airplanes. But if you do, you will annoy the people around you. I once had a guy get very abusive after I did a radio interview from a plane while I was at the gate because my voice tends to carry.\nThe Skyted Silent Mask allows you to talk on your phone silently so you don\u2019t annoy people around you and don\u2019t share what you\u2019re talking about with people who shouldn\u2019t be listening to your call. This product is currently available on Kickstarter for $249, but the price will eventually increase to $599.\nIt isn\u2019t a cheap date, but it isn\u2019t as bad looking as other solutions I have seen. It seems to work very well, and it could keep your calls quiet and reduce the chance you\u2019ll get yelled at if you have to take a call in a meeting or someplace else where a phone call would be problematic.\nI have one on order and hope it will ensure that the next time I have to do an interview on a plane, it won\u2019t result in another passenger wanting to punch me out (is it just me, or have passengers on planes gotten overly violent?). If they ever enable phone calls on flights, this thing could be as important as headphones are today.\nHorwin Senmenti X Electric Motorcycle\nI don\u2019t ride anymore, but when I saw the Horwin Senmenti X, I was tempted to buy another motorcycle. Due in 2025, folks who are into anime will immediately recognize this bike as a dead ringer for the bike in Akira.\nElectric with twin swing arms (which is what the Yamaha I used to own was supposed to have) and a very low center of gravity, it should be able to corner and stop faster than any other bike on the road, electric or otherwise. This thing looks like it came from the future. I imagine it would pull a ton of interest at motorcycle events and on rides.\nIf you like motorcycles and want to ride into the future, Horwin had several cutting-edge designs, but the one that excited me was this Senmenti X. Now I want to watch Akira again.\nPebble Flow Electric Car-Focused Camper Trailer\nI\u2019ve been watching the Pebble Flow camper trailer like a hawk even before CES, as it is an amazing trailer:\nThe problem, well, one of the problems with electric cars and trucks is that they lose a ton of range when pulling a trailer. But:\nThat is the Pebble Flow, designed for electric cars. This thing is amazing!\nYou can live off the grid for up to seven days with full power to all of the appliances, heating, and cooling, and it has 3x the electrical capacity of one Tesla Powerwall. This is the world\u2019s first dual-motor electric camper trailer, and it is a sign of things to come. I am so tempted to buy it.\nBrelyon Ultra Reality Display\n(Image Credit: Brelyon)\nI\u2019m a fan of head-mounted displays. While I use them when traveling, I don\u2019t use them in my home office. However, the idea of creating a monitor that uses technology to get the size of the device down to something more manageable appeals to me.\nCurrently, I use a Dell 49-inch monitor, but it is wider than my field of view when closed, and if I back away from it, everything gets smaller, which undoes the advantage of size. Plus, it entirely blocks any view out of my office window.\nThe Brelyon Ultra Reality Display is designed to be closer to your face. Similar to a head-mounted display, it employs high resolution to present the experience of a massive screen, eliminating the need for an actual large screen.\nYou get the equivalent of a 122-inch screen in a 32-inch form factor, so it\u2019s a smaller monitor with more screen real estate than my massive 49-inch screen. At $12,000, it is outside my price range for a monitor but could be ideal for a trader, coder, animator, engineer, or anyone else who needs a massive screen in a small form factor.\nIt is on my lust list, but I\u2019ll wait until the price comes down.\nRabbit R1\nFinally, we have the Rabbit R1, a wearable device (like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d communicator) that, for $199, gives you a body camera (handy for capturing YouTube events around you) and a better voice interface for your smartphone. It is in beta right now, and I think it could use some work on its industrial design as it looks more like a toy than the serious device it is.\nI expect products like this will become far more common as AI advances and we use these new, more advanced Siri-like capabilities more broadly. It has a natural language interface, and while initially it will work with most smartphones, it could represent an iPhone-like revolution to the current phone design.\nThe Rabbit R1 could represent the future of smartphones and is worth checking out. I just wish it looked more like a product from \u201cStar Trek\u201d rather than a product from some kid\u2019s TV show.\nWrapping Up\nCES was expensive this year as I saw 10 products that I wanted, and I ended up ordering several. I saw the future of robotics, PCs and monitors, smartphones, grilling, motorcycles, and voice communications at the show. I\u2019m already looking forward to next year, when I expect things will become even more exciting and expensive for me.\nPerci App and Vest Disaster Preparedness Kit\nWe have a lot of fires where I live. With the current weather, we\u2019re looking at some potential for flooding. There\u2019s also a huge fault line near our border, and we just had a killer snowstorm that made getting around problematic.\nAs a result, with global warming, we all need to do a better job with disaster preparedness, and the Perci app and vest are an effective way to start.\nEquipped with 25 essential items in easily accessible pockets, the Perci app and vest disaster preparedness kit is a comprehensive solution for any survival checklist. (Image Credit: Invicta Ready)\nThe app assists in rapid emergency preparedness by guiding you to prepare a packing list, establish a family meeting point, and form a trust circle for assistance. It also helps secure your home, create an inventory for insurance purposes, and consolidate real-time disaster alerts to ensure you don\u2019t miss critical updates.\nYou can order a vest equipped with essential emergency supplies, including medical items, hygiene products like toothpaste, and water purification tablets, providing critical resources needed in a disaster.\nWith the changes to the weather and other natural or human-caused catastrophes likely to become more common, we all need to become better prepared to run when the need arises. The Perci app and vest address that problem nicely, and it is my Product of the Week.\nRob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

The Indianapolis-based organization will encompass both the Indy Autonomous Challenge and potential future competitions focused on performance automation technology.\nThe effort aims to establish Indiana as a global hub for performance automation activity.\n\u201cThis is a way to ensure the longevity and the impact of the Indy Autonomous Challenge, while exploring whether that technology and those learnings could extend to additional technology platforms,\u201d said Paul Mitchell, president and CEO of Indianapolis-based Energy Systems Network. ESN organized the Indy Autonomous Challenge, and it is now organizing and launching the Indy Innovation Challenge.\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge\u2014which focused on developing and racing autonomous race cars\u2014attracted college-based competition teams from around the world who spent about 18 months developing software and preparing their cars for the inaugural race, which took place in October at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A second race in January at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway was part of the consumer-technology trade show CES.\n\u201cThe Indy Autonomous Challenge has not only helped Indiana engage with global young talent, it has helped raise awareness and recognition of Indiana\u2019s innovation ecosystem to a global audience,\u201d IEDC Vice President of Entrepreneurship Dave Roberts told IBJ in an e-mailed statement. \u201cIndiana is uniquely positioned to be a leader in innovation and in the technological advancements of traditional industries, and we are excited about the possibility of expanding new innovation challenges in the future.\u201d\nThe IEDC declined to make Roberts available for an interview but said, \u201cWe look forward to sharing more when the timing is right.\u201d\nMitchell said the Indy Autonomous Challenge has generated more than 4,000 media stories worldwide since the competition was announced in November 2019. Its culmination, the October 2021 race, drew more than 3,500 in-person spectators, and more than 60,000 people watched a live-stream broadcast of the race, which featured nine teams from 21 universities around the world competing for a $1\u00a0million grand prize.\nMitchell said the autonomous challenge has already generated more than $100\u00a0million in investment, a figure that includes the financial support universities provided for their teams, plus financial and in-kind support from sponsors of both the teams and the race events.\nBased on that investment to date, Mitchell said, the Indy Innovation Challenge expects to attract $71.3\u00a0million\u00a0 over the next two years from existing and new Indy Autonomous Challenge teams and sponsors. Added to the $3.4\u00a0million IEDC grant, that gives the Indy Innovation Challenge a budget of $74.7\u00a0million for the next two years.\nTo date, the challenge has spawned at least one startup\u2014Driveblocks, a spinoff from the German team TUM Autonomous Motorsport. TUM was the grand prize winner of the October race.\n\u201cWe want to build that into a set of lasting assets and ecosystem within the state, not just a one-off event that was fun to do,\u201d Mitchell said.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nIn its grant application to the IEDC, the Indy Innovation Challenge specifically identifies vertical takeoff and landing technology\u2014which is generating a high level of international interest and activity\u2014as a potential subject of a future challenge.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking first at something in the aerospace industry, because it\u2019s such an important industry to Indiana,\u201d Mitchell\u00a0said.\nVertical takeoff and landing aircraft, also sometimes referred to as air taxis or flying cars, are being developed as vehicles that could potentially ferry passengers across town in major metro areas, or within a larger region. Among the many companies exploring the concept are Indianapolis-based Republic Airways and Rolls-Royce, which has a major manufacturing presence here. Both companies are early-stage investors in a vertical-takeoff-and-landing company called Eve Air Mobility, a spinoff of Brazil-based aircraft manufacturer Embraer SA.\nThe Indy Innovation Challenge will be housed at the Emerging Manufacturing Collaboration Center, or EMC2, on the 16 Tech Innovation District campus on the near-west side of Indianapolis. That\u2019s also the home of the Indy Autonomous Challenge, which will now operate under the umbrella of the Indy Innovation\u00a0Challenge.\nPlans are already in the works for several additional Indy Autonomous Challenge events over the next two years, though locations and dates haven\u2019t been\u00a0announced.\nOther plans include the establishment of a performance automation lab at EMC2 that would serve the Indy Autonomous Challenge, hosting an annual Indy Autonomous Challenge workshop in Indiana, and establishing an alumni network for event participants, according to the IEDC grant application.\nBut the Indy Innovation Challenge is in its very early stages, Mitchell said, so numerous details about the organization are still being\u00a0determined.\nHe said the organization is conducting a feasibility study to determine what type of competition might make most sense; where and when it might take place; and what business, academic and government partners might be interested in\u00a0participating.\nThe goal is to wrap up that feasibility study early next year, at which point the Indy Innovation Challenge will decide on a new challenge.\nFor now, ESN staffers and outside contractors are handling the operations of the Indy Innovation Challenge. It\u2019s yet to be determined whether the Innovation Challenge will hire its own staffers at some point, Mitchell said.\n\u2018No silver bullet\u2019\nObservers say a strategy such as Indiana is pursuing can be effective\u2014if done in the right way.\n\u201cThey do help, at the very least, put communities on the consideration list for a site selector,\u201d said David Clayton, assistant vice president of corporate partnerships and strategic initiatives at Clemson University in South Carolina.\nClayton attended Indy Autonomous Challenge events in both Indianapolis and Las Vegas because Clemson engineering students designed the hardware and software stacks that went into the challenge\u2019s Dallara-built race cars.\n\u201cIt was a great project. We were glad to be part of it,\u201d Clayton said.\nBut something like the Indy Autonomous Challenge on its own won\u2019t be enough to spur significant economic development, he said. It will also take factors like university resources, a supply chain to feed the industry, customers\u2014and a community that\u2019s appealing enough to attract\nskilled talent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.\nJon Roberts, managing partner at Austin, Texas-based consulting firm TIP Strategies Inc., offered a similar view. TIP specializes in economic development strategy, and the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization has engaged the firm to help update the region\u2019s comprehensive economic development\u00a0strategy.\nRoberts said he sees potential promise in the Indy Innovation Challenge\u00a0concept.\n\u201cI applaud [Indiana] for doing it,\u201d he\u00a0said.\nThe difficulty with the tech-challenge strategy, Roberts predicted, will come in making Indianapolis \u201csticky\u201d enough to attract and retain capital and talent\u2014assets the city can build on long\u00a0term.\n\u201cIndy is not sticky,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a very difficult time holding on to its tech\u00a0workforce.\u201d\nBut Roberts said other communities have achieved this, and so could Indianapolis, by taking some of the same, \u201cvery specific steps.\u201d\nHe offered as an example the city of Austin, which has a large and growing tech sector.\nOne key factor in Austin\u2019s success, Roberts said, was the creation of an endowed professorship at the University of Texas at Austin. An endowed professorship means the professor who holds that position can tap into a dedicated source of research funding from an endowment set aside for that purpose. That, in turn, can attract federal funding, students and other faculty members who want to be part of the research.\nAt UT Austin, Roberts said, the endowed\u00a0professorship helped Austin become a hub for microprocessing\u00a0activity.\nForging connections with other communities can also be beneficial, he said. Austin is forging a relationship with Berlin, Germany. Both cities have a specialty in advanced manufacturing. Electric-car maker Tesla is based in Austin and recently opened a factory in\u00a0Berlin.\nEspecially in the age of remote work, Roberts said, partnering with a peer community can help each community build its own economy. \u201cYou\u2019re doubling your [talent] pool\nalmost immediately.\u201d\u2022\nPlease enable JavaScript to view this content.\nEditor's note: You can comment on IBJ stories by signing in to your IBJ account.

In this CES Tech Talk episode, IAC President Paul Mitchell discusses the competition with host James Kotecki, sharing that the January 7 event will showcase a highly complex blend of technologies ranging from AR and VR to automation and high-speed communication. Find out what's planned for the Innovation Paddock in West Hall. Spoiler: Think mammoth garages packed with the newest gear and more from the geniuses of robot car tech. Paul also teases some of what to expect, tech-wise, when the IAC returns to Las Vegas.\nPaul J. Mitchell\nChairman and President of Indy Autonomous Challenge\nPaul J. Mitchell is the founding Chairman and President of the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC), which organizes racing competitions among university affiliated teams from around the world to program\u202ffully autonomous racecars and compete in a series of history-making events at iconic tracks. Based in Indiana, the IAC is working to establish a hub for performance automation in the state and is harnessing the power of innovative competitions to attract the best and the brightest minds from around the globe to further the state-of-the-art technology in safety and performance of automated vehicles.\nThe IAC started as a $1 million prize competition with 41 university teams signing up to compete more than two years ago, representing top engineering and technology programs from 14 U.S. states and 11 countries. Teams competed to develop software capable of piloting 10 identical Dallara AV-21 autonomous racecars that were developed by IAC in partnership with Dallara Automobili S.p.A. and Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research.\nDuring its short tenure IAC has already set or broken every autonomous racing record including fastest lap (173 mph), fastest overtake (170 mph) and the autonomous land speed record (192.6 mph).\nThe primary goal of the IAC is to advance technology that can speed the commercialization of fully autonomous vehicles and deployments of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). These enhancements will lead to increased safety and performance in all modes of racing and commercial transportation. IAC has attracted world class sponsors and technology partners who work with IAC engineering staff and university affiliated teams to test, validate, and advance their cutting edge ADAS technologies that are integrated into the Dallara AV-21 racecars. Some current and past sponsors include: Amazon Web Services, Aptiv, Bridgestone, CARIAD, Cisco, Continental, Dallara, dSPACE, Indiana Economic Development Corporation, Intel, Luminar, Microsoft,\u00a0 New Eagle, NineTwelve, PrismSystems, PWR, RTI, Schaeffler Paravan, Valvoline, in addition to the Indiana Economic Development Corporation.\nThe IAC was originally organized by Energy Systems Network (ESN) in partnership with the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. Mitchell also serves as President and CEO of ESN,\u00a0 a 13-year consortium of companies and institutions focused on accelerating technology development and commercialization in the advanced energy and transportation sectors.\nThe first prize competition Indiana Autonomous Challenge Powered by Cisco was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS), on October 23, 2021. Following the success of this event, ESN organized the Autonomous Challenge @ CES\u00ae at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, on January 7, 2022, in partnership with CES\u00ae2022, the most influential technology show in the world.\nPrior to founding the IAC, Mr. Mitchell served in the Office of Governor Mitch Daniels where he was Policy Director for Economic Development, Workforce, & Energy. In this capacity, he oversaw legislation, policy, and program development for the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, Indiana Department of Workforce Development, and Indiana Department of Labor, and acted as the Governor\u2019s liaison to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor. During his tenure with the Governor\u2019s Office, Mr. Mitchell also led the formation of and directed the Indiana Office of Federal Grants and Procurement.\nA native of West Lafayette, Indiana, Mr. Mitchell holds a Masters of Public Affairs from the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Bloomington, Indiana where he graduated as valedictorian.\nPaul Mitchell (00:00):\nAutomation opens up opportunities to go at speeds that a human driver would feel uncomfortable with and do so safely. Human drivers in motorsport have for decades been doing things that regular humans aren't comfortable doing, and we're trying to prove that robots can do that and then apply that same logic to real-world scenarios.\nJames Kotecki (00:30):\nThis is CES Tech Talk. I'm James Kotecki. CES 2023 is January 5th through 8th in Las Vegas. And on this show, we get you hyped and get you smart about the world's most influential tech event.\nJames Kotecki (00:45):\nToday, we preview the autonomous vehicle technology that's roaring back to CES in the most exciting way possible. High-speed competition. This year the Indy Autonomous Challenge returns to CES and on Saturday, January 7th, the Las Vegas Motor Speedway will once again host IACs autonomous race cars as they compete head-to-head, or more accurately, code to code. To learn more about the event and how you can be a part of it, let's catch up with IAC president, Paul Mitchell.\nJames Kotecki (01:17):\nPaul, welcome back to the show. I want to get to what the IAC does and why that matters, but first just let's paint the picture for folks who are listening to this. What can we expect to look forward to at CES at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7th?\nPaul Mitchell (01:31):\nOn January 7th, what people are going to see is the world's fastest robots competing with each other. Last year we had speeds that were reaching 170 miles an hour with our fully autonomous race cars. After CES, we boosted the engine power to make the cars faster because we had essentially found the limit of what that car could do and we set a new land speed record. So, I expect that we'll see speeds close to 300 kilometers per hour or high 180 miles per hour.\nPaul Mitchell (02:05):\nThe other thing I think that will be different this year from those that tuned in or were able to attend last year is just a little bit more of a festival atmosphere. Obviously, with some of the challenges with COVID, we had some restrictions on how many people we could bring out to the track, the different spaces we could use. And so, we're hoping we can open that up much more and get a much larger crowd out there and really create that kind of excitement that you find at motorsports and racing events.\nJames Kotecki (02:35):\nSo I am a CES attendee and I'm registering for CES. My understanding is that there's a button or a section that I can click to say, Yes, I want to attend this event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7th. And that's just part of the registration.\nPaul Mitchell (02:49):\nYeah, so this is a CES event. This isn't the Indy Autonomous Challenge hosting the race that happens to be at the same time as CES. So if you're an attendee, during the registration process, there should be a box and a description of the Indy Autonomous Challenge and you can click on that. That obviously takes a record and connects your registration to our headcount for the event. And then transportation will be provided from the convention centers, certainly from West Hall, possibly from some of the other sites throughout CES, to and from the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. It's really not too far away. It's about maybe 20 minutes away actually, if you're at the convention centers, it's kind of the opposite direction of traffic in the strip. So it's quite reasonable to get out there and back and not miss too much action back at the convention centers while watching this race.\nJames Kotecki (03:43):\nYeah, it's just a classic high speed robot battle in the desert. I mean, in some ways in the tradition, in some ways maybe the spiritual successor to, if I think back to the original DARPA Grand Challenge years ago as I recall that initially was. Can you even get autonomous vehicles to just go from point A to point B in the desert? That was the first proven ground for autonomous vehicles.\nPaul Mitchell (04:04):\nIt was. And really we have been honored to be viewed as kind of the successor to the DARPA Grand Challenge. That was always our objective as we launched the Indy Autonomous Challenge in 2018 and then formally in 2019. Our goal was to bring back the excitement and the technical advancement that occurred through DARPA in 2004 and 2005 when they ran these grand challenges. But to add to it the excitement of motor sport and holding it in a venue where people can actually come and see it.\nPaul Mitchell (04:39):\nSo wandering out into the desert literally and seeing those cars run in 2004, 2005, you had to know what was going on and really be into the industry. For this, I think people can come from all walks of life. People who are at CES who maybe don't even know anything about autonomous vehicles, that's not why they're there. They may be there for other technology coming to this event. What you're really seeing is not just automation, but you're seeing all kinds of technologies. High speed communication, wireless communication. You're seeing ultra low latency computing. You're seeing elements of AR and VR we expect going forward. So there's a lot of technology across CES that is on display, on full display, in the Indy Autonomous Challenge through this platform of fully autonomous racing.\nJames Kotecki (05:31):\nI think it's going to be so exciting to see people in the stands cheering on these different vehicles, watching them race, compete head to head. And so when people are going to see, as far as what I remember, because I was actually able to attend last year, and it was really cool and I would definitely recommend people go to this one at CES 2023. So you're sitting in the stands and you're seeing two cars on the track just whipping around the race course. And in some ways, and I mean this as a real compliment to what the IAC teams have been able to do. If you didn't know any better, you might think people were in those cars.\nPaul Mitchell (06:01):\nYeah, absolutely. I think the racing has gotten so professional and sophisticated. The race lines that the cars are taking, that the strategies that the cars have for passing and preventing a pass from happening, really has begun to move much closer to the most elite human race car drivers. And to be clear, a human race car driver that's capable of driving an Indy car at 190-200 miles an hour, it's not you or I, right? It's a fraction of the population that's trained and trains their senses and their brain and everything to be able to do this.\nPaul Mitchell (06:39):\nSo for us to recreate that with algorithms and code and these cars were only invented essentially one year ago. That teams began to work with these cars in the summer of 2021. So in roughly a year, a year and a half, they've trained these algorithms to get closer and closer to the most elite race car drivers.\nPaul Mitchell (07:04):\nAnd I think another cool thing about our competition format that people will see, we run two cars at a time. So we don't run a full field where all the cars are racing simultaneously. Maybe we can talk about why that is, but our format is two cars racing head-to-head. And I often refer to it as almost like a game of chicken because the idea is they keep going faster and faster on each sequential round of laps until one car essentially throws in the white flag and says, I can't go any faster or there's a wreck. And we saw both of that, those scenarios play out last year, or I should say earlier this year rather.\nPaul Mitchell (07:44):\nAnd the reality is, when you don't have a human driver in the car, while wrecks are expensive, there's no danger to anybody's health or safety. So you see these teams, especially let's say in the final round or final couple rounds, they're not going to throw in the white flag. They're going to go until the car spins out of control and can't go any faster or their code fails. And we saw that with Technical University of Munich coming up just short against Team PoliMOVE from the Polytechnic of Milan in January.\nJames Kotecki (08:14):\nAnd is that a clue to why you're only doing two cars at a time? Because if these cars are going to kind of push themselves or the code's going to push them to the limit and there's just so much expensive advanced technology out there that you kind of want to keep the damage to a minimum?\nPaul Mitchell (08:29):\nYeah, I think that's part of it. So it's just preserving these million dollar assets to the extent we can is important to making our organization successful so we can keep running these events. The other though is that the technology we're seeking to prove out and the whole purpose of in the autonomous challenge is not really to create a racing series that would compete with or seek to replace Indy Car, Formula One or NASCAR. That's not the objective at all. The objective is to prove out technology in extreme use cases at high speed so that we can accelerate the pace of that technology commercialization into passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and actually perhaps to make human driven race cars safer and faster.\nPaul Mitchell (09:16):\nAnd so if you think about the use case of autonomous vehicles encountering each other at high speeds and what the sensor systems and the software need to be able to do, we hope that most of the time on a highway, if you're going very, very fast and another car is going very fast, you're only encountering two cars at the same time. At least most highway rules that don't allow for five, six cars to all kind of swarm together. So you're really training the vehicles to track and make decisions around one additional vehicle. And we think that is the most consistent with high-speed highway driving or other types of autonomous encounters that would occur in the real world.\nPaul Mitchell (09:59):\nWe have and we will continue to play around with adding an additional vehicle, let's say three cars, because we do want to see how the technology can track and manage more than one vehicle and actually understand which vehicle is and which vehicle is operating differently. But it's an exponentially harder technical challenge to try to run all the cars at the same time. And as you alluded to, could be extremely expensive if it went wrong. One car going bad and making bad decisions and taking out three or four cars could be a half million dollar accident.\nJames Kotecki (10:36):\nIt's really interesting to think about the commercial applications for some of the technology that will come out of this and the way that all of us as consumers will benefit from this in the long term. These edge cases aren't just edge cases in racing. They're going to actually really be helpful in certain real world high dangerous situations.\nPaul Mitchell (10:52):\nAbsolutely. And let's not forget that I think the future of automation and the promise that automation has and why it's so important for us to invest in these technologies, it's not one technology by the way, it's a whole host of technologies. The reason it's so important is that one, it will save lives. Because a lot of the accidents that actually result in loss of life are high speed highway accidents. There's certainly instances where people, particularly pedestrians, get hurt very badly or there's lots of life at lower speeds. But most of the deaths, at least in the United States, are highway accidents. And so preserving life is part of the mission of this technology.\nPaul Mitchell (11:34):\nThe other is sustainability and efficiency. If we can have over the road trucks, even passenger cars, I guess that people are trying to get to point A to point B more quickly, that can travel at higher speed safe. If you can imagine a fleet of fully autonomous trucks in maybe a dedicated lane that are traveling closer to 80 or 90 or maybe someday over a hundred miles an hour, that's going to result in huge efficiency gains in terms of the movement of freight, the movement of goods and services. Obviously if you have automation, you can look at longer operational timeframes because you don't have somebody that's getting tired. They can run through the night more easily because the technology and autonomous vehicles can see through darkness.\nPaul Mitchell (12:20):\nSo why high-speed matters is that automation opens up opportunities to go at speeds that a human driver would feel uncomfortable with and do so safely. And that's true for motorsport. Human drivers and motorsport have for decades been doing things that regular humans aren't comfortable doing and we're trying to prove that robots can do that and then apply that same logic to real world scenarios.\nJames Kotecki (12:47):\nYou did mention that you set a land speed record, so any more details you can share about that? I assume that's a land speed record for an autonomous vehicle. Congratulations. What did that actually look like?\nPaul Mitchell (12:58):\nThe autonomous land speed record was something we had our eyes on for quite a while because we began to see speeds that were getting close to the previous record, which was around 175 miles per hour. And we were starting to see that on our racing ovals. In fact, in Las Vegas we touched 173 during qualifying at CES in January, and so we knew we could beat it. We also knew that we needed to boost the engine power and the horsepower of our vehicles, which we've done on all the race cars. But we took one race car, the one that was actually the winner of the Autonomous Challenge at CES 2022, which was Team PoliMOVE from Polytechnic of Milan and University of Alabama. So we made the engine adjustment to that vehicle, boosted the horsepower and made some other modifications and we took it to a really iconic venue, the Kennedy Space Center and the landing strip, which is at the largest and longest landing strip in the world. I believe was used by the space shuttles when that shuttle program was going on. And so now that the shuttle program isn't going on any longer, this giant runway is something that you can petition the Kennedy Space Center folks to come and utilize. So we did that. They thought it was a great opportunity to showcase new technologies.\nPaul Mitchell (14:22):\nAnd so we did that and set the record at 192.2 miles per hour. We were really targeting either trying to reach 300 kilometers per hour, which is the big number in Europe. Of course, we would've loved to reach 200 miles an hour, which is the threshold that's often used in American motor sports. The vehicle we currently are using, the aerodynamics and the size of the engine, I just don't think we can quite get to that 200 number, but we're definitely in uncharted territory in terms of speed. And it was definitely a successful event.\nPaul Mitchell (14:59):\nIt was not just a gimmick. I think we needed to understand what the absolute speed limit was for our new engine package. So we would've had to go out and do some type of high speed straight line run just to validate the changes that we were going to be making to all the cars. But when we realized that would break the record, we said, Okay, let's go bring a film crew. Let's do this at a cool venue. And if people haven't seen it, check out our website. indyautonomouschallenge.com. There's some great video footage of the car setting the record, and you can see the space shuttle in the background and very futuristic feeling.\nJames Kotecki (15:32):\nWe've been mentioning the folks who are actually doing the work to make this happen. PoliMOVE. I believe the team's name acronym is TUMB. That was the second place team. And so these are teams of university students that come from all over the world to compete in this challenge. Can you tell me more about the teams that are competing in this iteration of the challenge folks that people can see at CES 2023?\nPaul Mitchell (15:55):\nSo really the heart and soul of the Indy Autonomous Challenge are autonomous racing teams. None of this would be possible without the incredible talent and brain power that these teams bring to bear. If you think about it, they're essentially the human element in this competition. They're the ones writing the code, they're the ones setting the parameters, they're the ones making decisions about what level of risk to take. We have nine teams, they're made up of more than a dozen universities. So some teams are just one university. You mentioned, for example, TUMB that stands for Technical University of Munich. Other teams are a mix of multiple universities. So we have a team, MITPITRW, which is MIT, Pittsburgh, Rochester Institute for Technology, University of Waterloo. So that's four universities that have come together.\nJames Kotecki (16:49):\nThat's sounds like a powerhouse team to me, just based on what I know about the technical brain power at those places. That sounds like a powerhouse. Yeah.\nPaul Mitchell (16:55):\nYeah. No. I mean, well, first of all, every one of the teams, every one of the teams, every one of the universities involved in the autonomous challenge are engineering innovation powerhouses. You can't do this without being in the absolute elite of the elite. What we're seeing with the professionalization of the autonomous challenge teams is really exciting. These started out as perhaps more academic endeavors by the universities who looked at it as a prize competition that was, as I said earlier, similar to the DARPA Grand Challenge.\nPaul Mitchell (17:30):\nWhat we're seeing now is that the institutions that are involved are viewing it as not only a kind of academic research activity, but it is drawing attention and branding to the institutions. So it's a way to recruit top talent to come to those universities. It's a way to increase the awareness that industry and government has of those universities and what they're doing. And then, as I always expected, we're starting to see spin outs. So these teams are creating startup companies, often affiliated with the universities and spinning out of the universities.\nPaul Mitchell (18:08):\nAnd so if you look at the makeup of the teams today versus a year ago, the university affiliation has to be there. That is one of the requirements we have. But the teams are now made up of a mixture of let's say, full-time PhD students, but also researchers, faculty, students who may be working for a center or a lab or a spin out company. That way they're able to really maximize the technology transfer potential that comes from these teams. And I'm just so proud of, as I really call the professionalization of these teams and also their ability to go out and seek their own sponsors, their own industry partners. So the MITPITRW team I mentioned earlier, they have relationships and partnerships with Waymo, with Oracle.\nPaul Mitchell (19:00):\nSo of course Indy Autonomous Challenge has our corporate sponsors and they are the ones that are providing the technology that goes on to the cars. The teams themselves also are able to go out and find sponsors.\nJames Kotecki (19:11):\nAnd we should say for those who are going to be at CES, they can see and meet some of these sponsors. And perhaps you tell me maybe some of the folks on these teams. There's another part of CES that you're going to be active in. It's the Innovation Paddock, which is actually a section at the conference center. Basically this is your booth where a lot of these folks are going to be hanging out throughout the show. Can you tell us more about that?\nPaul Mitchell (19:32):\nYeah, so first of all, the two things that make the Indy Autonomous Challenge work are the teams, which we just talked about, and then the sponsors, the corporate partners. Every one of the cars is identical. That's important for everybody to understand. They all use the same hardware, the same base software. And then the difference is the individual teams developing the software to run the vehicles. So our sponsors, which we've had several that are legacy sponsors like Cisco, Bridgestone, Luminar, Delara, and then we have a lot of new sponsors that are coming on, like Continental, DSpace, AWS, company called Vector Nav.\nPaul Mitchell (20:09):\nThey are partnering with us and we're also collaborating with the Indy Economic Development Corporation to build out Innovation Paddock inside West Hall. And we're really fortunate to have one of the largest, maybe most prominent exhibition spaces in West Hall, much larger than what Indy Autonomous Challenge had last year. And we're able to do that because we're constructing essentially a series of almost like garages that'll look like a racing paddock. And some of our partners, some of the teams, some of the corporations that we're working with will occupy those spaces to really showcase the various technologies and innovations that are part of the Indy Autonomous Challenge.\nPaul Mitchell (20:48):\nAnd it's a great partnership with CES. We're not a typical exhibitor. We're not a corporation that has a typical product that we're bringing to the market. And our product really is the network effect of our teams and our corporate partners working together. And so this innovation paddock will be a way for people to learn about Indy Autonomous Challenge, understand intimately what we're doing, even without, for example, coming to the track on January 7th. We realize there's hundreds of thousands of people coming to CES, we hope, and not all of them are going to be able to go out to the track. So for those that can't, come by and see us in West Hall and learn all about it. And those that can come to the track, I think it'll just get them excited for what they're going to see.\nPaul Mitchell (21:32):\nI also should point out that we will have a live broadcast of the race. So if you can't make it to the track on January 7th, if you're working a booth or if you've got other obligations or you don't sign up in time to meet our headcount limit, you can watch the event live on Twitch through a partnership we have with AWS and AWS Sports. We'll probably have that beamed back into West Hall into our booth. If people want to come watch it at our booth, that's another place they could check it out.\nJames Kotecki (21:59):\nWell, if you need color commentary on that broadcast from just a civilian like me, just a guy who can't believe what he's seeing and is just completely amazed, let me know.\nPaul Mitchell (22:07):\nWe may take you up on that. We've got some good professionals that have been working with us, but we need the James Kotecki check in, like when they bring in a former NFL player something to the Monday night football broadcast. You can come in.\nJames Kotecki (22:22):\nJust a guy who's just flabbergasted by all the amazing advancements that is happening. Speaking of being surprised and just delighted by all of this, does anything surprise and delight when you go to these competitions, when you set the land speed record? Obviously I know that you're passionate about this, but you also are so deep into the weeds of the technology and what is possible and what the expectations are. What surprises you or what could surprise you as these competitions continue to go forward?\nPaul Mitchell (22:49):\nThere's kind of two things that come to my mind when I think about what I'm sort of awestruck by. One is the impact that what we're doing has on the next generation. So we try to bring STEM high school students to our events when we can. That's a little challenging at CES because obviously there's security and age restrictions and things associated with the show. But at other events that we have, like our race, we're going to be running the Indy Autonomous Challenge powered by Cisco at Texas Motor Speedway. We're bringing high school STEM students there. And we've done that at some of our other events.\nPaul Mitchell (23:24):\nAnd when you see the awe and the excitement of these young STEM students who are part of robotics clubs, maybe their entire lives, but didn't necessarily understand that that could go to the level of almost being like a celebrity, which is what they see in our teams. Oh my gosh, this robot club that I'm in could eventually lead me to being a race car driver type of thing. Every time you see that, it's very rewarding.\nPaul Mitchell (23:49):\nThen in terms of what surprises me from a technology standpoint, it's just the pace at which new technologies and new innovations are happening. We have already put new technology on the cars, a new computer from D Space, new IMU and GPS systems from Vector Nav. We boosted the engine. So the pace at which the technology changes and our ability to integrate that into our cars and then to have our cars have these extra capabilities as a result of that technology change is really impressive.\nPaul Mitchell (24:24):\nThe last thing I guess I would say is that when I saw a car going over a hundred miles an hour in complete darkness and realized that race cars don't need visible light if they're autonomous, that was also pretty crazy. And there's a video of that. If you haven't seen it again, go to our website and you can check that video out. So that maybe is the one thing that we do in the Indy Autonomous Challenge that no Formula One, no Indy car driver, nobody in the world can do because humans need light to perceive their surroundings and the fact that we can do that in darkness is pretty cool.\nJames Kotecki (25:00):\nSo Paul, we've covered so much excellent ground in this conversation about what has happened and what will happen in the immediate future at CES 2023, but CES is also a place to make big announcements. Anything you want to share or possibly tease that's coming and people can look forward to?\nPaul Mitchell (25:15):\nYeah, so we are absolutely viewing CES as an opportunity to roll out plans for Indy Autonomous Challenge with a number of our sponsors and partners for 2023 and beyond. I don't want to get into the details of those because we've got to save the full excitement for CES, but we're going to be looking at things like the integration of AR and VR into motor sport in ways that have never been done and frankly cannot be done unless you have autonomous vehicles. We're also going to be looking at transitioning from ovals to road courses, which is something we've talked about wanting to do. That changes the whole dynamic in terms of the software and the algorithms to be able to navigate road courses, which is probably closer to highway or road driving than an oval.\nPaul Mitchell (26:02):\nAnd also, just talking about some new sponsors, some new hardware and software that will go on to the vehicles. I talked earlier about the constant changing pace of the technology, and so what's exciting is our sponsors view us not as a one off. So if we're using Lumina's LiDAR today, we want to use their next gen LiDAR and the next gen technology from Cisco and the next gen technology from Bridgestone and Continental and DSpace. So the constant refresh of the car is something we're going to be talking about.\nPaul Mitchell (26:34):\nSo just some fun announcements for those that want to understand where this is all going. I think we'll have a lot to say at CES this year.\nJames Kotecki (26:43):\nWell, we will stay tuned and are so looking forward to seeing you and the competition at CES 2023. Paul Mitchell, President of the Indy Autonomous Challenge.
