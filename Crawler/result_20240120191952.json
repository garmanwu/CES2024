With the unique series design, the device has three components: leg, hand, and waist. The device is designed to provide targeted relief and treatment of limb diseases such as deep vein thrombosis, varicose veins, and poor blood circulation based on the concept of \" limb diseases prevention first\".\nDifferent from conventional limb therapy devices with monotonous massage functions, the design of this series of products reflects professionalism in the field of physiotherapy. The device zoned a body with the three components for the legs, hands, and waist, which is based on the body part\nvulnerable to diseases. And the device offers different massage for different parts of the body to ensure professional massage. Meanwhile, each component has a built-in intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) device, which enables the user\u2019s limb to be fully wrapped. With multiple air pressures and multi-stage pressure settings, the device allows the user to massage different areas of the limb at a realistic level according to their needs.\nIntermittent pressure is applied to promote blood flow back to the limb and relieve muscle fatigue, thus providing prevention and relief. The multiple heating modules are reproduced to warm during the massage, which further optimizes the massage. To avoid over-massaging, the product is also equipped with an automatic shut-off function, which is automatically switched off after 30 minutes of operation to avoid damage to the user's limbs.\nAdditionally, the design of the device is user-friendly. The color LCD display on the main control unit allows the user to visualize the real-time massage status and to adjust the heating and massage modes that can be adjusted freely through the simple control buttons. The user can also access massage information via the accompanying app and customize the massage solution.\nEntrant Company\nRobin Delaere\nCategory\nFurniture Design - Other Furniture Design\nEntrant Company\n\u539f\u80da\u5ba4\u5167\u88dd\u4fee\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8/Yuanpei interior Decoration Co., Ltd.\nCategory\nInterior Design - Residential\nEntrant Company\nShenzhen Viking Battle Technology Co., Ltd.\nCategory\nFashion Design - Watches\nEntrant Company\nLA CADIERE\nCategory\nLandscape Design - Master Planning\nAdvertisement\ninfo@museawards.com\nCopyright \u24b8 2024 MUSE Design Awards.\nAll rights reserved.
