        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design. Those rated the highest across all categories receive the Best of Innovation designation.\nFor the CES 2024 program, the top two categories by number of submissions were \u2018digital health\u2019 and \u2018sustainability, eco-design & smart energy.\u2019 This trend underscores the rapid pace of innovation in sectors that promise to solve big global challenges and improve human lives \u2013 a major theme at the show as CTA partners with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS) to advance human security. For the first time, the Best of Innovation list for CES 2024 includes a product from the \u2018Human Security\u2019 category, introduced at CES 2023.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards also features a new category \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). The AI category received 7% of all applications, underscoring that innovators are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of technology. AI will also be pervasive throughout the CES 2024 show floor and conference programming.\nThe full Best of Innovation list and all 522 Innovation Award honorees will be announced during CES 2024, where many of the products will appear in the Innovation Awards Showcase at CES, located in the Venetian Expo.\nThe Best of Innovation honorees for 2024 include:\nAirFarm\nCompany: Midbar Co., Ltd.\nProduct Category: Human Security for All\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAirJet\u00aeMini \u2013 Solid-State Active Cooling Chip for Electronic Devices\nCompany: Frore Systems\nProduct Category: Embedded Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAVEIR\u2122 Dual chamber (DR) Leadless Pacemaker System\nCompany: Abbott\nProduct Category: Digital Health\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nCompany: Bose\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nFINTIN V1 : The Most Accessible Qwerty-Communicator\nCompany: ONECOM.CO.,LTD.\nProduct Category: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nGun Detection System\nCompany: Bosch\nProduct Category: Artificial Intelligence\nHestia\nCompany: VAONIS\nProduct Category: Digital Imaging/Photography\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHonda Motocompacto\nCompany: Honda\nProduct Category: Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHP Spectre Fold\nCompany: HP Inc.\nProduct Category: Computer Hardware & Components\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nIINK - 4D Food Printing System for Future Food\nCompany: Top Table Inc.\nProduct Category: Food & AgTech\nInteractive Transparent Window\nCompany: AUO Corporation\nProduct Category: In-Vehicle Entertainment\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nITX181225\nCompany: I-TEN SA\nProduct Category: Sustainability, Eco-Design & Smart Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nJBL Authentics 500\nCompany: Harman International Corp\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nMand.ro Mark 7D\nCompany: Mand.ro Co.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won\u2019t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nJose Munoz, president and global CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, speaks during a Hyundai news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas.

General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

These micro-devices, known as organ-on-a-chip (OOC) platforms mimic the in vivo like microenvironment of living organs and offer more physiologically relevant in vitro models of human organs. Consequently, the concept of OOC has gained great attention from researchers in the field worldwide to offer powerful tools for biomedical researches including disease modeling, drug development, etc. This review highlights the background of biochip development. Herein, we focus on applications of LOC devices as a versatile tool for POC applications. We also review current progress in OOC platforms towards body-on-a-chip, and we provide concluding remarks and future perspectives for OOC platforms for POC applications.\n1. Introduction\nSoon after the development of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), the potential of these miniaturized platforms for various applications in life science has been revealed. During the past few decades, interest in biological or biomedical MEMS (BioMEMS) has been drastically increased and it has found widespread applications in a various areas of biomedical and life science including diagnostics, therapeutics, drug delivery, biosensors and tissue engineering [1]. These integrated systems are also known as \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d (LOC) or \u201cmicro-total analysis systems\u201d (\u03bcTAS). Microfluidic based LOC devices have often been notified as a landmark in biomedical research and life science [2,3]. However many microfluidic based devices which are currently categorized under BioMEMS do not have any electrical or mechanical components (e.g., DNA and protein arrays) [1].\nIn recent years, microfluidics technology with many advantages including precise control over the cellular microenvironment in very small volumes [4,5], merged seamlessly with cell biology and tissue engineering techniques [6,7]. This has enabled us to develop novel microengineered cell culture platforms [7,8].\nOOC platforms which are microfluidic cell culture devices to mimic tissue- and organ-level physiology [9,10], have been developed very rapidly in the past few years. These platforms with great potential to advance our understanding about tissue and organ physiology [11], offer portable and cost-effective biomedical tools for diseases modeling [12,13], pharmaceutical research [14,15] and personalized medicine [5,6]. In OOC, the word \u201cchip\u201d roots from the original fabrication techniques [7,16] (e.g., a modified form of photolithography) which have been used in computer microchips manufacturing [17]. This allows us to control surface feature shapes and sizes on the nm to \u00b5m scale [18].\nThis paper focuses on development of LOC and OOC technologies from their origins. Here, we briefly describe LOC devices for POC application. We also highlight previous and recent progress in both areas of LOC and OOC and introduce some of the major pioneers in this market. Finally, by looking through specifications of LOC and OOC, we discuss future perspectives in the development of OOC platforms toward user friendly devices for drug discovery and POC applications.\n2. BioMEMS\nDating back to the 1950s, new techniques in microfabrication technology developed rapidly when the planar technologies were introduced into the microelectronics [19,20]. At the beginning of the 1980s, with major progress in microelectronic systems and taking the advantages of miniaturization and parallel manufacturing, the concept of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) appeared as the integration of mechanical and electrical functions into a single chip with small structures for various applications (e.g., biochemical applications and chemical engineering applications) [2,19]. Similar microfabrication techniques as those used in microelectronics to manufacture integrated circuits (IC) in the semiconductor industry, are used to fabricate MEMS microdevices [1]. Generally, by repeating particular orders of photolithography, etching techniques and thin-film deposition steps, fabrication of a micro/nano scale structure on planar substrates is being achieved. Figure 1 demonstrates the basics of the photolithography process. It starts with spinning a photoresist with a certain speed to spread to a desired plate thickness on the substrate. The next step is to heat up the photoresist to evaporate any solvents. The photoresist should be then irradiated with UV light while passed through a photomask. A post exposure bake may be needed to accelerate the curing of the photoresist. For the positive tone interaction, the areas which are exposed to UV radiation are removed after development. This is opposite for the negative tone. Interested readers are referred to References [21,22,23] for a review of microfabrication and microstructure formation technologies.\nProcess of photolithography: (a) Spinning a photoresist to spread and heat up to evaporate any solvents, (b) irradiating with UV light through a photomask, (c) positive/negative tone. Figure is reproduced from the Reference [3].\nIn the past few decades, various techniques to form micro scale structures have been developed. A brief description on the techniques which are more relevant with BioMEMS and microfluidics is provided in the following sections. During the 1980s, the \u201ctotal chemical analysis system\u201d concept emerged in analytical chemistry to propose the process of automation in analytical systems [2]. In the early 1990s, Manz et al. presented the concept of using planar fluidic devices to handle small volumes of liquid and established the field of \u201cminiaturized total chemical analysis system\u201d (\u00b5TAS) for this concept [24]. The high speed electrophoretic separation of fluorescent dyes [25,26] and amino acids which are fluorescently labelled [27] are the first examples of microchip analysis, which was developed in the early 1990s. As MEMS based devices have evolved, the interest in microsystems as new research tools for biomedical applications has significantly increased and different start-ups were founded to manufacture and take advantage of these microsystems in the life science field [19]. Due to their small size, capability to work on short time scale and ability to act under physiologically relevant conditions, MEMS devices provide the unique opportunity for fabrication of analytical platforms which are particularly attractive for biological applications [28].\nBioMEMS is a subset of MEMS which has the biological or biomedical applications. These miniaturized devices use manufacturing techniques inspired from microfabrication technology. Processing, delivery, manipulation and analysis and/or construction of biological or chemical samples take place in these micro-devices [29]. Interest in BioMEMS applications such as diagnostics in DNA and protein micro-arrays, microfluidics platforms, pacemakers, biosensors, drug delivery systems etc. is increasing very rapidly [30,31]. Stimulating neural implants, retinal implants for therapy of blind patients and microneedles for vaccination to prevent suffering from physical pain are some examples of BioMEMS applications [1]. The progress of BioMEMS technology coupled with the recent advancements in biotechnology (e.g., genomics, proteomics, tissue engineering), provide exciting opportunities for advancing the applications of BioMEMS devices. BioMEMS for detection (e.g., antibody detection, bacterial detection, viral detection), analysis (e.g., identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility), diagnostics (e.g., cancer and autoimmune diseases), monitoring (blood glucose monitoring in diabetics patients), drug delivery (e.g., administration of antibiotics), cell culture (e.g., OOC platforms) are some of the practical applications achieved by the advances in microtechnologies [1,29]. Just like the important role of microprocessors in the computer revolutions, BioMEMS devices have a significant role in the future of biomedical science. BioMEMS technology puts together the innovative talents of physicians, biological scientists, electrical, mechanical, chemical and materials engineers to develop miniaturized devices with various biomedical applications [6,16].\nThree categories of materials can be used for fabrication of MEMS based devices for biological applications. The first group includes silicon, glass and other materials that originate in the electronic industry and have been used in the early MEMS devices [1]. The second group of materials is plastic and polymers (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane known as PDMS). Polymers due to their biocompatibility, low thermal and electrical conductivities, low cost, ease of fabrication, rapid prototyping and ease of surface modification are ideally suited for fabrication of BioMEMS [32,33,34]. We refer the interested readers to References [35,36,37] for polymer-based microfabrication techniques. The third group contains biological materials such as proteins, cells and tissues which can be used in BioMEMS devices [9,38]. However the use of biological materials is quite new. This category of materials offers many attractive opportunities in biomedical area (e.g., tissue engineering, OOC) [6,17].\nBioMEMS and \u03bcTAS are subsets of MEMS devices. Even though BioMEMS are more focused on micro-fabricated devices for biological applications, they have significant overlap with \u03bcTAS which are basically more dedicated to the integration of the sequence of laboratory steps to accomplish chemical analysis. Such a small platform may gather the whole laboratory functions into a chip format. The idea of LOC has been developed after realizing that applications of \u03bcTAS technologies are not just limited to analytical purposes. Accordingly, LOC devices also are a subset of MEMS. LOC platforms use microfluidics, which is the science of manipulation of extremely small volumes of liquids. LOCs are integrated microfluidics platforms to perform multiple laboratory processes into a single chip. In the following section, we will review microfluidic platforms and their applications in the biomedical field.\n3. Microfluidics\nThe annual number of new publications on the topic of microfluidics is increasing rapidly and continuously every year [39]. The investigation of fluid transport in plants is a good bio-mimicking example for studying of fluid mechanics in micro-channels, [40] on which it focuses on various specific characteristics of the dynamics of viscous flows in very small capillary tubes. However, because of the advances in microfabrication methods, the subject has received immense attention in recent decades [3,41]. A microfluidic platform consists of micro-scale fluid handling compartments such as channels, valves, reservoirs, membranes etc. which enable integrated, automated, parallelized and miniaturized biochemical analysis in a consistent and easy manner. Microfluidics with its specific characteristics such as small size and laminar flow pattern offer new abilities in terms of spatiotemporal control of molecules [19,42,43], enabling biomedical devices to decrease the size and increase precise control over the platform. Laminar flow regime happens at very low fluid speed or low Reynolds-number (\u201cRe\u201d). The Re number is a critical dimensionless number in fluidic dynamics which is used to characterize the behavior of the fluid in the system [2]. The Re number is characterized by the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces [4]. Since viscous forces tend to keep fluid steams moving very smoothly over each other without chaotic mixing, when the viscous forces are dominant (at low Re), a series of parallel fluid streams appears without mixing between them. This type of fluid flow is known as laminar flow. However, at high Re, inertial forces are dominant which results in unexpected movements and chaotic mixing between the fluid streams. This type of fluid flow is known as a turbulent flow [3,44]. Figure 2 demonstrates the schema of the laminar and turbulent flow. Fluids behave in a different way at the microscale than they do at the macroscale. One of the most important differences between macroscopic and microfluidic systems is the type of flow in microfluidic systems [45]. Generally, the flow is turbulent at the macroscale (Re > 1000), while at the microscale laminar flow is dominant. In microfluidics, fluids flow in parallel patterns without any radial, axial and tangential mixing due to the absence of turbulent vortexes and mass transfer can only happens through the interface between the molecules of the fluid layers by diffusion. This type of flow, as mentioned, is known as laminar when the viscous forces are dominant on inertia forces which are characterized by smooth flow (Re < 1) as oppose to the characteristics of turbulent flow. Thus, microfluidics provide precise and spatiotemporal control over the fluid by providing a laminar regime over the system [4].\nLaminar versus turbulent flow in the microfluidic channels. Figure is reproduced from Reference [44].\nSurface tension is another important feature in microfluidic systems. The small amount of fluids in microfluidic systems and big surface to volume ratio will result in insignificant gravitational and inertial forces and significant surface interactions such as capillary and hydration forces in these systems. Therefore, surface tension becomes strongest and dominant in such systems [45].\nCulture bottles which have been in use since almost 1850 [39] and culture dishes which were introduces by Petri in 1887 [46] are some of the basic classical liquid handling tools for biological analysis and diagnostic assays. These traditional liquid handling tools have the potential of high\u2013throughput sample processing and are easy to handle [6,39], but lack of portability, lack of automation and high expenses to have a complex automated laboratory are some of their disadvantages [39]. Microfluidic devices have advantages to overcome these limits such as simpler automation, use of less sample volume, portability, simultaneous and parallel tests, faster analysis, lower cost per assay etc. [19,44] and compete well against these conventional tools.\nMicrofabricated micro-channels have been used by many researchers in this filed to accomplish capillary electrophoresis assays [47], to observe deformation of red blood cell membrane under hydrodynamic flow [48], in chemical micro-reactors [49], to transport living cells [50] and micromixers [51], among other applications.\nMicrofluidics have been raised from different origins of microelectronics, molecular biology, and chemical analysis [2,52,53]. One of the origins of microfluidics is microelectronics where microfabrication techniques such as photolithography have been shown to be very successful in microelectronics and MEMS devices. Microfluidics have been developed as a branch of MEMS devices which are specialized in liquid handling. The initial work in microfluidics has used silicon and glass as materials and microelectronic manufacturing techniques for the fabrication of micro-devices. However these materials are favorable when chemical or thermal stability is required, but neither silicon nor glass has the appropriate requirements such as gas permeability, full compatibility, and desired wettability for biological assays.\nThe other contribution to develop microfluidics systems has been raised from molecular biology. Genomics, Proteomics and other areas related to molecular biology (e.g., high-throughput DNA sequencing) require more sensitive and high throughput analytical methods. The ancient route of microfluidics comes from chemical and biochemical analysis. Chemical analysis techniques such as gas-phase chromatography (GPC), high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) merged with the power of laser in optical detection to achieve sample analysis in low volume with high sensitivity. However, the number of commercialized microfluidics platforms in practical applications still is quite low and they have not been widely used yet, but microfluidics is very well established in academia for the development of new methods and various applications in biomedical areas [6,9].\nAt the beginning of the 1950s Elmqvist patented the first practical Reyleigh break-up ink-jet platform by efforts to distribute very small volume of liquids (nanoliter and picoliter) [54]. This innovation provided the basis for ink-jet techniques which are already used in printers. Later, in the year 1979, Terry et al. developed a miniaturized gas analysis platform based on the principles of gas chromatography (GC), using photolithography and chemical etching techniques on a silicon (Si) wafer [55]. Manz et al. by using Si-Pyrex technology have developed the first high-pressure liquid chromatography column device. At the beginning of the 1990s, several miniaturized microfluidics structures [56,57] have been developed by the techniques used in the fabrication of micro-scale structures in silicon [39]. Later, simple and easy to operate microfluidic devices based on capillary liquid transport have been developed. Test strips for drug abuse [58], pregnancy tests [59], cardiac markers [60] are among the first few commercial microfluidic devices which obtained a significant market and still have high sales potential.\nFollowing the efforts towards miniaturization to reduce the time of analysis and to have better performance, the newly emerging concept of \u201cmicro total analysis systems\u201d (\u00b5TAS) which later expanded to \u201cLOC\u201d appeared [24]. In the following section, we discuss about microfluidics application to develop LOC devices.\n4. Lab-on-a-Chip\nLab-on-a-Chip (LOC) based-devices integrate multiple laboratory functions on a single chip of only a few square millimeters to a few square centimeters in size. These platforms provide miniaturized, automated, integrated and parallelized chemical and/or biological analyses [61] which can offer cheaper, faster, controllable and higher performance of bio-chemical assays at a very small scale when compared with conventional laboratory tests. These microengineered devices are capable of handling extremely small fluid volumes down to less than a few picoliters. [3]. Just a few micro-droplets of whole blood, plasma, saliva, tear, urine or sweat have the potential to be tested in these miniaturized platforms for medical diagnostics [62]. This last is highly important in many clinical trials and biomedical research where usually very small volumes of patient samples are available. In another side, automation with eliminating the human interfering parameters can increase the confidence in the analysis [63].\nA clear example that demonstrates the principle of LOC is the portable blood test device which has been developed by the Biosite Company. Just a drop of patient\u2019s blood is required to displace into the reservoir of the device then the entire of the assay takes place on a single platform and the diagnostic can be done in only a few minutes [19].\nOther biomedical applications for LOC have been reported including proteins and DNA detection [18], hormone detection [64], pathogen detection [65]. In the following section, we focus on the application of LOC platforms in POC diagnostic devices.\nLab-on-a-Chip Devices for Point-of-Care Diagnostics\nPoint-of-care (POC) diagnostic platforms are small medical devices which provide diagnostic results quickly in the easiest way [41]. However, these diagnostic procedures can be performed by healthcare professionals, but working with these devices does not need trained specialists and the tests can be done by the patient in a range of settings including home, laboratory, hospital or clinic. Increasingly, the need for the fast diagnostic of acute diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and for home care testing such as blood glucose monitoring in diabetic patients, has grown the interest to develop POC systems. The high surface area to volume ratio in microfluidic systems results in a significant decrease in the time of analysis in LOC for POC testing [66]. This provides the chance for rapid diagnosis and receipt of treatment as soon as possible at the point of care. Moreover, non-expert users can easily work and obtain the test results with these POC devices.\nLateral flow tests or capillary driven test strips which have been well known since the 1960s [61], are the major class of POC systems which use a membrane or paper strip to confirm the presence or absence of a target analyte such as host antibodies or pathogen-antigens. By adding a small volume of sample, capillary action [39] will be induced and the sample moves along the channel passing through the membrane where immobilized antibodies and labels have been stored. If the targeted particles are present in the sample, it will bind to the immobilized antibodies and labels and continue to move along the device. As the sample moves, the binding reagents which are located on the membrane will attach to the targeted compound at the test line. The test results can be read out qualitatively where a colored line forms, or quantitatively where the device has been combined with reader technology to provide results [66,67].\nThese automated and on-site diagnostic devices provide cost-effective, easy to handle and disposable tools to detect different biomarkers including proteins, nucleic acids, cells and metabolites such as glucose, urea nitrogen, lactate, etc. [66]. Test strips for detection of infectious diseases such as pneumonia [68] and influenza [66], also for detection of sexually transmitted infections like syphilis and HIV [41], are some of the examples of lateral flow tests in POC. In developing countries, due to the little or no medical infrastructure, the mortality rate from infectious disease is quite high [69,70]. Therefore, POC systems by fast detection of infectious diseases significantly help to increase patient survival rate [18].\nThe test strips for glucose-level monitoring [71] for glycemic control and the lateral-flow immunoassay [72] for home pregnancy test are some of the well-established early examples of POC systems which obtained a remarkable market. Based on the first capillary driven immunoassay system that was introduced in the later 1970s [39], the \u201cover-the-counter pregnancy test\u201d was developed and commercialized in the 1980s [73]. The device consists of a sample inlet, a sample layer, a conjugate layer, incubation and detection layer, a detection window and an absorbent layer. When the patient\u2019s sample (urine) is introduced into the sample layer through the device\u2019s inlet, it moves by capillary forces. In the conjugate layer, where the antibodies have been stored, binding between antibodies and sample\u2019s antigens (human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) takes place. As the sample is transported into the detection layer, this binding reaction continues. Another type of antibody on the test line catches the particles which are coated with antigens. There is a third type of antibody on the control line to catch particles which did not bind to antigens. The presence or absence of hCG (pregnancy hormone) in the sample will be detected by the detection line, while the control line, which appears on every test, demonstrates that the test works properly. Within minutes, the result appears in detection window indicating whether or not hCG hormone has been detected in the sample [39,74] (Figure 3).\nLateral flow assay schematic design: (a) A lateral flow test strip including sample inlet, sample layer, conjugate layer (i.e., reactive agents and detection molecules), incubation, detection zone and final absorbent layers including test and control lines (i.e., analyte detection and functionality test), (b) introduction of sample into the test strip via sample inlet, (c) antibodies conjugated to labeled nanoparticles start to bind to the analyte, (d) antibodies with antigens bind to the test line and antibodies without antigens bind to the control line. Reproduced from Reference [39].\nIonic blood chemicals and metabolites can be used as biomarkers to determine various health conditions such as liver disease, diabetes etc. Glucose monitoring systems for management of diabetes, have occupied the majority of the biosensor market [75]. Blood glucose monitoring devices (Figure 4) that significantly improve diabetic patients\u2019 lives, also perform on membranes but its analytical method is different from lateral flow immunoassay as it use signal amplification by a redox enzyme. Reaction between glucose oxidase in the test strip and the glucose in the blood will produce an electrical current which determines the concentration of the glucose in the sample and provides numerical results for readout by the meter [41].\nBlood glucose monitoring system: (a) Scheme of a commercial blood glucose test device, (b) different layers of a biosensor test strip. Reproduced from Reference [76].\nPOC diagnostic devices have significant impacts in public health of developing countries. Although, low power consumption, cost-effective analysis, fully-automated test, ability to use unprocessed specimen (e.g., whole blood), being highly user-friendly, provide interpreted results quickly and less challenges regarding to transportation and storage are some of the parameters which should be given more attention to design of POC devices for resource-limited settings in the developing world. Table 1 provides a list of current microfluidics companies which provide commercialized LOC-based point of care diagnostic devices.\nTable 1\nList of selected microfluidic companies working to manufacture integrated point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices. Adapted from Reference [41].\nIncreasing the interests towards microfluidics and its applications in biomedical areas in the last two decades led to the emergence of novel fabrication technology using biocompatible polymers for biological applications [6,16]. The incorporation of microfluidics with MEMS manufacturing techniques has provided the possibility of producing delicate molds for casting microfluidic patterns by use of a biocompatible polymer such as PDMS. PDMS has unique properties including gas permeability, biocompatibility, optical transparency, elasticity, low cost and ease of microfabrication with soft lithography technique [6,9]. These advancements in microengineering have led to innovate new generation of cell culture platforms known as OOC. In the following section, we highlight current achievements in this field.\n5. Organ-on-a-Chip\nAs mentioned above, microfluidic cell culture platforms by providing a dynamic physiological microenvironment for cells and precise control over small amount of sample, offer unique advantages over traditional cell culture techniques (e.g., culture in Petri dishes) and static 3D cell culture models (e.g., scaffold techniques and scaffold free techniques). The majority of research relies on monoculture cell signaling and cell-cell interactions in two dimensions. However, cellular interactions in three dimensions at the tissue and organ levels have significant impacts in cellular responses to environmental cues [7,77]. Conventional 2D cell-cultures are not able to mimic the 3D structure, mechanical properties and biochemical microenvironment that cells experience in a living organ [7,78]. Various static 3D cell-culture models (e.g., bioreactors, spheroid and gel based cell culture techniques) were developed over 50 years ago to overcome the limitations related to 2D cell-culture [6]. Compared with conventional 2D models, 3D cell culture models better simulate the 3D microenvironment that cells normally experience in vivo and advanced our understanding of the cell behavior in better bio-mimicking tissue models [12]. On the other hand, microfluidic cell culture platforms provide better mimicking of a more sophisticated manner of cell culture and analysis at the microscale [79]. As compared to static cell culture models, microfluidic cell culture platforms are able to emulate the dynamic microenvironment for the cells when macroscopic cell culture models fail to reproduce the microenvironment of the cells as it is in vivo. Microfluidic cell culture based platforms offer the possibility of creating biochemical gradients of metabolites, soluble factors, cytokines and other molecules in the cellular microenvironment [6]. The specific characteristics of microfluidic systems, such as the laminar flow pattern, can provide sustained biochemical gradients. For instant, Han et al. developed an in-vivo like inflammatory model in a microfluidic platform to characterize neutrophil migration behavior influenced by a gradient of two chemoattractants. This study showed that neutrophils demonstrate different responses to the chemoattractants [80]. With other unique benefits such as decrease in reagent consumption, smaller volume of samples, decrease the risk of contamination, and reproducibility, microfluidic based culture models offer unique in vitro platforms for high throughput cell culture assays [81]. Table 2 illustrates an overview of the significant advantages of microfluidic cell culture versus macroscopic cell culture models (e.g., 2D cell culture and static 3D cell culture models).\nTable 2\nA comparison between the advantages and disadvantages of macroscopic cell culture models and microfluidic cell culture platforms.\n\u201cOOC\u201d platforms are new generation of 3D cell culture models that better emulate the dynamic, physicochemical, biochemical and microarchitecture properties of the microenvironment of living organs. These microfluidic cell culture platforms recapitulate the cellular microenvironment, tissue\u2013tissue and cell\u2013cell interface interactions, spatiotemporal, biochemical gradients and biomechanical properties of a whole living organ with the aim of mimicking the smallest functional unit of an organ.\nFigure 5 represents the general process to fabricate a microfluidic OOC platform. The principles to manufacture OOC based platforms are almost similar. Basically, after considering various parameters to emulate the specifications of a specific organ, the desired design would be drawn with a design and drafting software (e.g., AutoCAD, CATIA). Later, an appropriate microfabrication technique (e.g., photolithography, stereolithography, soft lithography etc.) according to the aims of the device will be used to fabricate the device. Cell culture or tissue culture will be performed on the biochip in order to mimic the functionality of a specific organ and to perform biochemical or biophysical assays and drug testing.\nGeneral process to fabricate a microfluidic OOC platform. Design, microfabrication, tissue culture and biological assays are the main steps to develop an OOC microfluidic platform for biological or pharmaceutical tests.\nIn the following section, we highlight the current advancements in OOC platforms.\n5.1. Current Organ-on-a-Chip Platforms\nGas exchange between air and blood takes place in the pulmonary system which has a complex structure. A bio-mimicking in vitro model of the lung is critical to model lung diseases (e.g., infectious diseases), drug development and toxicity tests. The most specific characteristic of the lung is its dynamic and periodic mechanical motion. In the pioneering work by Huh et al. [12], the first breathing lung-on-a-chip model has been introduced. In this biomimetic microdevice, the critical functional unit of the living lung (alveolar-capillary interface) has been constructed. To mimic the effect of breathing, this breathing lung-on-a-chip model used a lateral vacuum to apply cyclic stretching motion on a thin porous flexible PDMS membrane which acts as the interface between pulmonary microvascular ECs and alveolar epithelial cells (Figure 6). This model has been used to test immune responses to pulmonary infection and the response to nanoparticles. Interestingly, the periodic mechanical motions influenced the experimental data. This highlights the importance of physiologically relevant in vitro platforms to model human diseases and drug testing.\nSchematic design of the microengineered lung-on-chip model developed by Huh et al. [12]. An alveolar-capillary interface constructed on a flexible and porous PDMS membrane. By applying vacuum to the side chambers, a mechanical stretch has been created on the alveolar-capillary barrier to mimic a human breathing lung. Figure is reproduced from Reference [12].\nDouville et al. [82] developed an alveolar model. In this platform, alveolar epithelial cells were influenced by two different physiological conditions: the combination of solid mechanical stresses and surface-tension stresses, and exclusively cyclic stretch. The impact of fluid-filled alveolar cavities (e.g., in pneumonia) in alveolar epithelial cell death has been studied. The results demonstrated that cell detachment and cell death increased when cells experienced a combination of fluid and solid mechanical stresses.\nStucki et al. [83] presented a lung-on-a-chip model by the construction of an alveolar barrier in respiratory dynamics. A patient derived bronchial epithelial cell line demonstrated how mechanical stretch influenced epithelial barrier permeability. This model also showed that cell culture improved in the in vivo like dynamic model compared to a static one.\nRecently, Jain et al. [84] developed a therapeutic model of microfluidic lung-on-a-chip for intravascular thrombosis in lung alveolus. Antagonist to protease-activated receptor-1 has been tested in this platform. This platform offers the potential to mimic pulmonary thrombosis pathophysiology towards antithrombotic drug development.\nBenam et al. developed a \u201csmall airway-on-a-chip\u201d model. This model has an air channel on top and a fluid flow channel on the bottom, between which a mucociliary bronchiolar epithelium layer has been placed. Asthma has been mimicked in vitro by exposing the epithelium to interleukin-13 (IL-13). This model was able to recapitulate in vivo like responses to therapeutics.\nThe global public health crisis linked to the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic and its socio-economic disaster [85] brings so much attention to the OOC community regarding the crucial importance of developing reliable models of lung-on-a-chip platforms for disease modeling and drug development purposes to tackle the continuous spreading of COVID-19 and other human respiratory viral infections. In the recent work by Si et al. [86] a human lung airway biochip was developed and lined by human lung airway epithelial cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. To investigate the potential of this lung-airway-on-a-chip to mimic lung physiology and pathophysiology, seven anti-viral therapeutics have been tested on this platform. This study demonstrated that OOC models are promising in vitro tools to emulate human lung responses to respiratory infections.\nMultiple design factors need to be considered to mimic the cardiovascular physiological microenvironment. Cardiac muscle tissue consists of organized cardiac muscle cells (or myocardium) and fibroblasts. Blood vessels also have complex structures including smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and blood flow which result in fluid shear and vessel deformations. Microfluidic platforms are able to apply defined shear profiles into the cells cultured in the system. In addition, microfluidic platforms can take advantages of using syringe pumps and on-chip valves [87] or Braille display devices [88] to move fluid flow over the cultured cells to create more a physiologically relevant in vivo like blood vessel microenvironment. Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide [89] Therefore, new drugs and therapies to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases are urgently needed. Moreover, many drugs to treat other diseases have adverse side effects on the cardiovascular system [89,90] which highlights the importance of in vitro models of the cardiovascular system for drug testing.\nAu et al. [91] developed a polystyrene cell culture chip with microgrooves. Electrical stimulation applied and mutation and elongation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes augmented to form gap junctions. Marsano et al. [92] fabricated a three-dimensional beating cardio tissue on a microfluidic chip (Figure 7). Mechanical stimuli which have been applied on the platform during the culture ended up with better cell maturation and augmented the electrical and mechanical coupling. Various concentrations of isoprenaline have been tested on this device which highlights the application of this heart-on-a-chip model in drug discovery and toxicology tests.\nSchematic design of the heart-on-a-chip platform developed by Marsano et al. [92]. This includes two microchambers which are divided by a PDMS membrane. The top chamber is subdivided into a central channel to grow 3D cell culture, and two side channels to refill culture media. The cardiac muscle\u2019s contraction and relaxation mimicked through deformation of PDMS membrane by applying pressure on the bottom channel. Figure is reproduced from Reference [92].\nA mussel-inspired microfluidic chip was fabricated by Ahn et al. [93] to test cardiac contractility. Gelatins as an extracellular matrix as well as silver nanoparticles and titanium oxide have been used to fabrication of this three-dimension chip. In vitro contractile effects can be measured on this biomimetic analytical platform by cardiotoxicity of nanoparticles that affect calcium signal to sarcomere.\nLind et al. [94] used 3D printing to develop a cardiac tissue on a chip for drug testing applications. Xiao et al. [95] developed a microfabricated bioreactor to incorporate aspects of perfusion into the cardiac tissue model. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing template, covered with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and human ESC derived CMs was used to create this perfusable 3D microtissue (which is called Biowire). This platform has been used for drug testing. Another cardiac model was developed by Ren et al. [96] to mimic hypoxia-induced myocardial injury. This microfluidic platform emulates the interface between cardiac tissue and blood vessels. By using the specific oxygen consumer blocking agent in the channels, hypoxic conditions were created. This resulted in morphological changes (e.g., cell shrinkage) and signs of apoptosis. Finally, Guenther et al. [97] fabricated an artery-on-a-chip platform to study the physiological response of the small blood vessel. In this microfluidic platform, small blood vessels have been placed within the channel, and then negative pressure to specific regions applied to clamp them in place. Various concentrations of biochemical solutions can be perfused in the channel. This platform mimics the complexity of the physiological structure of the blood vessels.\nThe brain is one of the most sophisticated organs which comprises of a wide variety of cells. Human brain genetics and functions are significantly different than animals. Therefore, animal models only can give us a basic understanding of the brain functions and diseases [98]. Microfluidic brain-on-a-chip models have been developed to better mimic in vivo conditions including chemical, electrical and physical conditions of the human brain [6,99]. Here, we briefly review the current developments of microfluidic brain models.\nOwing to the importance of axons in neurodegenerative disease, some researchers only focused on neuronal axons. A microfluidic platform has been developed by Taylor et al. for high-resolution axonal transport. Isolation and monitoring of axonal mitochondria and axonal growth have occurred in this platform [100]. A circular microfluidic chip presented by Park et al. [101] in which the soma compartment was located in the center with sealed microgrooves divided from the axonal compartment. A straight pathway for axonal growth resulted from these microgrooves. An image processing method to quantify the axonal growth has been developed by these researchers to address the issue of invasive sampling to characterize the growth of axons. Effects of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components (e.g., matrigel, collagen, laminin and etc.) have been assessed on axons growth and soma compartments separately. Based on which parts of the neurons are exposed to these biomolecules, they have different effect on axon growth.\nA multilayer microfluidic platform fabricated has been developed by Park et al. [102] to mimic in vivo brain microenvironement for neurodegenerative diseases and high-throughput drug testing. The pluripotent human cells were grown on a chip to incorporate the blood-brain barrier. The cellular interactions between human fetal neural progenitor cells and the mature model have been assessed in this platform. By using an osmotic micropump, the effect of flow on neurodevelopment has been investigated. Kunze et al. [103] developed a microfluidic platform for neural cell culture to construct neural layers and 3D architecture. They described agarose\u2013alginate mixtures which build multilayered scaffolds with layers of embedded primary cortical neurons apart from cell-free layers. To form concentration gradients, B27 supplementation has been delivered. This 3D scaffold based microdevice has the potential to be used for in vitro studies and drug testing.\nA silicone elastomer brain-on-a-chip in vitro model was presented by Kilic et al. [104]. Neurospheroids were cultured on a microfluidic chip with flow control. Complex neural network and neural differentiation occurred on the platform by changing the flow. Toxic effects of amyloid-\u03b2 in two different conditions (with and without flow) have been assessed in the system. The results showed that neurospheroids develop better in the dynamic conditions. Dauth et al. fabricated a multiregional brain-on-a-chip model [105]. Particular disease models can be developed on this platform. A decrease of firing activity and change in the amounts of astrocytes and particular neuronal cell types in comparison with separately cultured neurons was noticed in their research. The effects of phencyclidine (known as angel dust) which is a mind-altering drug have been investigated in this platform as well.\nMagnetic hyperthermia therapy attracted researchers\u2019 attention in cancer therapy due to the generation of local heat to minimize damage to healthy cells nearby and optimize the treatment. Recently, a microfluidic based brain tumor-on-a-chip model was developed by Mimani et al. [106] to access the therapeutic effect of magnetic hyperthermia on the chip. A 3D cell culture of glioblastoma has been cultivated in the central zone of the microfluidic channel. Cell viability after exposure to magnetic hyperthermia therapy has been studied on the device. Results of fluorescence imaging have demonstrated that cell viability decreased by 100% after 30 min of exposure to magnetic hyperthermia therapy. However, tumor vasculature is absent in this model; the results of this study showed that this brain tumor OOC model has great potential to emulate the characteristics of glioblastoma brain tumor in vitro (Figure 8).\nBrain tumor-on-a-chip model developed by Mimani et al. to access magnetic hyperthermia therapy on-a-chip. This chip was formed by a central and an external compartment separated by a porous interface. Magnetic nanoparticles through the central microfluidic channel introduced to central region of the chip which tumor cells have been cultivated in the 3D model. Then, through an alternating magnetic field, magnetic energy transforms to thermal energy and produce heat. Image reproduced from Reference [106].\nThe liver with its crucial functions such as metabolization, detoxification of blood from various metabolites and production of biomolecules for digestion, is one of the most vital organs. Since toxicity of the liver is one of the main causes of drug failure, an in vitro model of the liver that can mimic the in vivo like microarchitecture of the liver is crucial in drug development processes. Hepatic lobule (which is comprised of sinusoids and blood vessels lined with endothelial cells) is the functional unit of the liver [107]. Since the perfusion of fluid is the main characteristic of the liver, microfluidic cell culture platforms must provide perfusion conditions that better emulate liver function in vitro when compared to conventional cell culture models [108].\nPowers et al. [109] developed a liver-on-chip model which had a silicon sheet scaffold with an array of channels which were separated by a microporous filter to provide upper and lower chambers for perfusion of the culture medium. They observed morphogenesis of 3D tissue structures under continuous flow perfusion in this platform. Lee et al. [110] presented a microfluidic liver-on-a-chip platform to assess hepatocytes interactions and hepatic stellate cells in 3D culture model. This platform was able to provide the continuous perfusion of culture medium to the cells through an osmotic pump without the need for an external power source. They developed monoculture and co-culture of hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells and investigated cellular interactions with or without flow.\nLee et al. [111] introduced an artificial microfluidic liver sinusoid on a chip by packing a high density of hepatocytes into a microchannel. This platform recapitulates the transport phenomena in sinusoid in which sinusoidal endothelial cells facilitate blood and plasma transport to the hepatic cords. Transport properties of the sinusoid (e.g., continuous nutrient exchange and cell\u2013cell interactions) were maintained in this platform to give the possibility to primary rat and human hepatocytes to stay viable for a period over 7 days. By using a liver toxicant, hepatotoxicity has been assessed in this liver sinusoid on chip platform.\nBavli et al. [112] developed an integrated microfluidic liver-on-a-chip platform to monitor metabolic activities (e.g., glucose uptake, lactate production and oxygen uptake) in vitro. Khetani et al. [113] introduced a model in which hepatocytes and 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on a micropatterned collagen in 24-well plates. Cho et al. [114] presented microfabrication and micropatterning techniques to create layered hepatocytes on micropatterned fibroblast feeder layers. This platform has been used to assess cellular interactions in the co-culture model of hepatocytes and 3T3-J2 fibroblasts.\nIn the liver-on-a-chip model presented by Delalat et al. [115], a 3D cellular microstructure was developed to mimic the hepatic sinusoid for screening the drug cytotoxicity. Furthermore, some other liver-on-a-chip platforms have been developed for in vitro modeling of liver injury and disease [116,117].\nRecently, Kamei et al. [118] introduced a simple 3D liver-on-a-chip model with mature hepatocyte-like cells which have been differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In this study, a microfluidic cell culture platform was used for the hepatocyte-like cells maturation. This platform can be served in drug testing and chemical-safety assays.\nThe Kidney is one of the most sophisticated organs to mimic since it is comprised of several tissues. The kidney is known as a vital organ for its crucial functions including filtration of blood, toxin removal and maintenance of electrolyte balance. One of the most reported adverse effects during the drug development process is the toxicity of the kidney. The first model of toxicity was a study on a kidney-on-a-chip microdevice reported by Jang et al. [119]. In this model, primary kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells have been cultured on a microfluidic device under perfusion. Fluidic flow emulates the key characteristic of the human kidney proximal tubule. Reabsorption of glucose, transport of albumin and alkaline phosphatase activity have been studied in this microfluidic kidney-on-a-chip model.\nAccording to the importance of glomerulus which is critical in blood filtration, Musah et al. [120] developed a kidney-glomerulus-on-a-chip model. In this platform, human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into podocytes which are the cells that regulate selective permeability in glomerulus. Glomerular basement-membrane collagen to provide tissue\u2013tissue interactions with glomerular endothelial cells have been generated in vitro. Adriamycin-induced albuminuria and podocyte injury have been emulated via this glomerulus-on-a-chip model.\nA glomerulus-on-a-chip microfluidic platform developed by Zhou et al. [121] emulated the vascular and epithelial interface between podocytes and endothelial cells in the kidney glomerulus. To mimic the glomerular microenvironment in vitro, perfusion of fluid flow and mechanical forces have been applied in this microdevice. This study demonstrated the importance of shear stress and hydrodynamic pressure in cellular cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular damage to emulate kidney disease such as hypertensive nephropathy.\nRecently, a virus-induced kidney disease model was fabricated by Wang et al. [122] by developing a three-layer microfluidic platform. This distal tubule-on-a-chip model was presented to investigate the pathogenesis of virus induced renal dysfunction in regulation of electrolyte.\nA review published by Wilmer et al. [123] focuses on development of kidney-on-a-chip technology to mimic the structural and functional properties of the human kidney for prediction of drug-induced kidney injury.\nHuman in vitro models of the intestine are very important in pharmacokinetics studies. Conventional in vitro models fail to recapitulate physiological microenvironment (e.g., cyclic prestaltic motion) of the human gut. Therefore, microfluidic platforms provide a powerful in vitro model of intestine to mimic in vivo like microenvironment for drug testing.\nA microfluidic device consisting of two lumens which have been separated by a porous membrane was developed by Kimura et al. [124]. A stirring pump was integrated to the platform to control the fluid flow in the system and to create a dynamic environment for the cells. Caco-2 cells have been cultured in the system for over 30 days and Rhodamine 123 was added into the system to investigate the cells permeability.\nIn the microfluidic gut-on-a-chip model developed by Kim et al. [125] provides in vivo like peristaltic movements and fluid dynamics were applied on the system to induce intestinal epithelial cells to undergo multiple intestinal cell types differentiation. The 3D structures and complex physiological functions of the human intestine can be recapitulated in this platform. An intestinal inflammation model was developed on a gut-on-a-chip platform presented by the same group. The platform can be used for the pathophysiological study of human intestinal inflammation produced by overgrowth of bacteria [126].\nRecently, a gut-on-a-chip model was developed by Shin et al. [127] which provides mechanical movements and perfusion of fluid flow in the system to investigate the role of physical stimulus on intestinal morphogenesis. Human intestinal Caco-2 and primary intestinal epithelial cells have successfully been cultured in this gut-on-a-chip model. Other cell types such as mesenchymal cells can be incorporated to this system to investigate how they can contribute to intestinal morphogenesis. The 3D morphology which was observed in this model, matches perfectly with the related computational simulations.\nThe skin is considered as the largest organ with several specific functions including regulation of body temperature, prevention of dehydration and acting as the first protection shield to protect other organs against environmental stressors (biological, physical and chemical). For toxicology testing of new compounds, physiologically relevant skin models are of crucial importance for pharmaceutical, chemical and cosmetic industries to identify potential hazards on the skin [128]. In this section, we highlight the current developments on skin-on-a-chip models. One of the key features to develop biomimetic skin models is to simulate vasculature and blood circulation in vitro. Thus, the combination of tissue engineering with microfluidic technology by providing the possibility of media perfusion is expected to reconstitute more relevant skin models and provide valuable evaluation of drug tests [129].\nWagner et al. [130] developed a microfluidic platform integrated with a peristaltic micropump for co-cultures of human artificial liver microtissues and skin biopsies. In long-term (14 days) exposure to fluid flow, crosstalk in the co-culture has been observed. In this platform, tissue sensitivity by exposure to troglitazone, a pharmaceutical substance, has been investigated. In vitro skin models which consist of dermal and epidermal layers are more physiologically relevant when compared to single epidermal layer models. A skin-on-a-chip platform designed by Abaci et al. [131] had a specific capability of recirculating the media without the need for pumps or external tubing at favorable flow rates. Physiological residence time of blood in the skin tissue has been established in this platform to provide relevant concentration of drugs in the blood. This platform is used for toxicity drug testing.\nThe incorporation of biosensors with biochips provides in situ and real-time monitoring of skin tissue responses to the test item. A sophisticated skin-on-a-chip platform integrated with a sensor was developed by Alexander et al. [132] for monitoring the transepithelial electrical resistance of recreated human epidermis. Metabolic parameters and change of skin tissue over time have been monitored in this platform. Recently, Kwak et al. [133] fabricated a skin-on-a-chip microfluidic platform in which epidermal and dermal layers were co-cultured with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. Immune responses such as an increase in secretion of cytokines and migration of neutrophils into the demal layer after exposure to doxorubicin and UV irradiation have been observed.\nA three-layer PDMS microfluidic skin-on-a-chip device with two porous membranes was fabricated by Wufuer et al. [134] In this model, a co-culture of human skin cells (epidermal, dermal and endothelial layers) has been developed. Separate microfluidic channels in this system provide the possibility of perfusion of various kinds of media with different flow rates. By perfusion of tumor necrosis factor alpha into the channels, skin inflammation and edema have been mimicked in this system. Drug toxicity testing by studding dexamethasone\u2019s effect on reducing inflammation and edema has been performed in this model. Although this dynamic and multilayer co-culture platform lacks the 3D microenvironment of the skin.\nLee et al. [135] developed a skin-on-a-chip model based on 3D co-culture. In their design, dermal primary fibroblasts have been embedded in hydrogel to provide a 3D dermal layer. Then, on top of the collagen-fibroblast layer, primary keratinocytes have been cultured to represent the epidermal layer. Endothelial cell-coated microfluidic channels have maintained the growth and differentiation of skin cells in this biochip. Cell culture experiments combined with mathematical modeling have demonstrated that perfusion through a microfluidic network maintains the long-term culture of skin cells for up to two weeks. A skin-on-a-chip platform has been presented by Jusoh et al. [136] to mimic the effect of skin irritants on angiogenesis. In this model, irritated keratinocytes biochemically stimulate vascular endothelial growth factors. Autocrine and paracrine interactions between dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes increase angiogenic sprouting in this model. The effect of the sodium lauryl sulphate (a well-known chemical irritant) and steartrimonium chloride (which is known as a non-irritant compound) has been studied in this platform.\nMore recently, a simplified gelatin-based skin-on-a-chip model has been developed by Jahanshahi et al. [128] for studying wound infection, skin\u2019s pro-inflammatory response and drug screening. In this platform, keratinocytes have been cultured on the microchannels which have been embedded in a gelatin matrix. After long term (6 weeks) culture, a multilayer structure of epidermis layer was formed. However this model lacked the presence of other cell types (e.g., fibroblasts). It is still a functional model to study the skin\u2019s pro-inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and drug testing.\nAs briefly reviewed here, in the past few years, various skin-on-a-chip models have been fabricated. However, to develop more reliable skin models to mimic the complexity of 3D architecture of human skin, the presence of vascular network and immune cells is crucial for toxicology tests and study skin diseases.\n5.2. Body-on-a-Chip\nMulti-OOC platforms or body-on-a-chip platforms refer to in vitro models which emulate interactions between two or multiple human organs within a microfluidic system. These complex microfluidic platforms can be used to emulate interactions among divers organs for drug discovery, toxicity tests etc. [137]. There are some biological challenges such as creating a suitable media for all cell types, appropriate scaling of organs, immune responses in the system etc. that need to be considered in multi-OOC platforms. Moreover, technical challenges including avoiding bubble formation in these complex systems, maintaining long term sterility, optimizing the physiological parameters for different organs etc. need to be addressed in these sophisticated microdevices. References [137,138] highlight the critical design parameters for biomimetic multi-OOC platforms to develop physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) models which have the potential to be used in the pharmaceutical industry.\nSince liver and kidney are the two crucial organs in metabolism and excretion of drugs, a liver\u2013kidney co-culture model [139] was developed on a microfluidic platform to investigate metabolism changes under drug components. HepG2/C3A cells co-cultured with kidney cells for toxicity test of a variety of molecules. This platform can be used in pharmaceutical and environmental toxicology testing. A liver-kidney model has been presented by Choucha-Snouber et al. to investigate the toxicology of an anticancer agent (Ifosfamide). By comparing the results of the liver\u2013kidney co-culture with the kidney monoculture biochip, this study highlights the importance of multi-organ microfluidic in vitro models in toxicity tests and drug testing.\nAn integrated liver\u2013heart\u2013vascular microdevice developed by Vunjak-Novakovic et al. [140] incorporated liver, cardiac and blood vessel cells in a microfluidic platform which potentially can be used in toxicity tests of cardiovascular drug components.\nIn another interesting study which was presented by Maschmeyer at al. [141] Troglitazone, an antihyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory drug which was withdrawn from the market because of its toxicity effects on liver, has been tested on microfluidic platforms. The liver toxicity was observed in response to Troglitazone on two separate microfluidic co-culture platforms (liver-intestine and liver-skin) which highlights the efficacy of in vitro multi-OOC models in drug testing.\nA microfluidic liver-intestine model introduced by Bricks et al. [142] demonstrates the critical role of intestine in oral medications absorption and excretion. This model emulates the interactions between HepG2 C3A cell lines and intestinal Caco-2 TC7 cell lines to assess intestinal absorption and liver metabolism of drug components. They studied the interactions between liver an intestine cells in a conventional co-culture model and a microfluidic co-culture biochip. The results demonstrated that the functionality of the liver in microfluidic biochip increased when compared with conventional models. Moreover, drug metabolism was elevated in the biochip co-culture platform when compared to co-culture in Petri dishes and with monoculture on a microfluidic platform.\nA four-OOC model was presented by Maschemeyer et al. [143] to study absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in co-culture model of intestine, liver, skin and kidney. Other multi-OOC platforms have been reported by several research groups word wide including liver-tumor-bone marrow [144], liver-lung-adipose tissue-other tissue [145], liver-lung-kidney-adipose tissue [146], liver-vascular -adipose tissue [147,148].\n5.3. Organ-on-a-Chip Market\nWhile various challenges [6,33,149] remain to be addressed before adoption of OOC technology by clinicians and pharmaceutical industry, a number of start-ups have been raised in the past few years to occupy the high-potential market by their own innovative technology. Some start-ups are more specialized in developing specific OOC, while others propose to develop an independent biochip with the possibility of developing different organs. Some others have the intention to fabricate a single organ device and some others prefer multi-organ platforms to assess interactions between organs. Each player in the field proposes its own unique technology, which has specific applications, drawbacks and strengths. However, still there is a significant gap between market needs and available technologies and it seems new players need to show noticeable progress to demonstrate the predictive validity and reproducibility of OOC platforms for disease modeling and drug discovery. The adoption of OOC technology by industry will start with contract research organizations (CROs), which support biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in R&D services [150]. Therefore, OOC companies require abundant quantitative and qualitative research to prove that these OOC devices are true mimics of human organ functions and accelerate their adoption by CROs and consequently by industry and health care system [33]. Here, we have briefly summarized a number of pioneers in commercialized OOC devices (Table 3). Interested readers refer to Reference [33] for extensive details and discussion in this regard.\nTable 3\nList of some of the OOC start-ups and highlight of their technology.\n6. Discussion and Future Perspectives\nThis state of art summarizes current progress regarding BioMEMS, LOC for POC applications, OOC platforms and the history of developing these technologies specially for new players in the field. Indeed, this review is dedicated to background and current advancements in LOC and OOC technologies and their applications in life. Since the main intention of developing biomedical devices is to bring the technology from academia to the market for improving human health, a list of pioneers in commercialization of LOC and OOC devices has been summed up for interested readers. Here, having a look at developed LOC devices for POC applications and OOC platforms by considering their specifications, limitations and strengths presented above and summed up in Table 4, we highlight possible future perspective for OOC technologies.\nTable 4\nA summary of specifications, limitations and strength of current LOC and OOC.\nIt has therefore been shown that materials, microengineered technologies, functionality, reproducibility, being user friendly and automation through integrated systems are the main parameters involved during development of each one of these inventions. Although many features of these technologies have been described in the literature and summarized in the present work, numerous others have to be investigated further.\nMEMS based devices have a wide variety of applications from the electronic industry [2] to environmental [151] and biomedical fields [1]. Development of commercialized BioMEMS including LOC for POC devices and microfluidic biochips continue to increase consistently. Various exciting directions are expected for the future of LOC highly integrated devices for diagnostic and therapeutic are some of the interesting applications of LOC devices. For instance, rapid detection of viral infections [152,153] and early detection of cancer biomarkers [154,155] directly from body fluids are some of the highly attractive subjects in this area.\nAccording to the literature, some of the LOC devices have been already commercialized years ago (e.g., home pregnancy tests, real-time glucose monitoring, etc.). Miniaturized portable LOC devices for POC applications are ideally suited for testing in developing countries where expensive and complex laboratories do not exist. These automated, accurate and cost effective diagnostic devices do not need highly trained health care experts and can be used on-site by patients. In most of the LOC devices which are categorized as a subset of BioMEMS, electrical and/or mechanical parts are integrated to the system [20,63]. Therefore, in these platforms, normally whole patient samples (e.g., blood, saliva, urine and etc.) are introduced into a single chip and all the steps of the laboratory process including separation, filtration, analysis and read out of the results take place on the small single chip. The result of the assay usually would be available visually (e.g., yes or no in pregnancy tests or digital numbers of the blood glucose level in glucometers) and hence it does not need inferences by the experts. The global health crisis due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) [156] pandemic highlights the critical importance of LOC for POC testing for early diagnosis of suspected cases and treatment monitoring of infected people to prevent further spread of the infection. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current diagnostic approach for COVID-19 [157]. However, this is a time-consuming and costly method which requires developed facilities and highly skilled staff and is not robust in the early stages detection and can show false negatives for up to two weeks. Hence, rapid, sensitive and automated LOC devices for POC applications are urgently needed to detect COVID-19 from patient samples (e.g., saliva, plasma and etc.) [85,158].\nSince cell culture is a critical aspect in biomedical science for understanding human physiology and pathophysiology, toxicology tests, drug screening etc., microfluidic-based cell culture platforms with the aim of mimicking the in vivo like microenvironment for cells have strongly attracted researchers\u2019 interest in recent years worldwide. However, most of the microfluidic-based cell culture devices, which have been developed in academia, are not integrated with electrical or mechanical parts, but in terms of microfabrication technologies and principals, these platforms, which are well known as OOC platforms, have been categorized as a subset of BioMEMS systems. These platforms take advantage of microfluidic systems and microfabrication techniques to provide cell culture and tissue culture platforms which recapitulate tissue\u2013tissue interactions, biochemical and biomechanical microenvironments of living organs. OOC systems use cells, spheroids, organoids and tissue biopsies to mimic tissue or organ level functionality in vitro. Hence, unlike LOC platforms, these samples are required to be prepared by trained experts and the results of the analysis need to be concluded by scientists in the field. Most of the microfluidic OOC platforms are still in the proof-of-concept stage because of some major challenges including low throughput (e.g., due to single channel designs), short lifespan of the biochip (e.g., due to channel blocking or clogging), complex sample preparation and limitations linked with material for fabrication (e.g., absorption of small molecules by PDMS). Making balance between academic research and commercialization is worthwhile to expand microfluidic based OOC platforms into clinically useful in vitro tools. Achieving organ physiological function in vitro is not an easy process. Another key point to develop commercialized OOC devices is the design of the device. An appropriate design for microfluidic OOC platform needs to be simple enough for the ease of manufacturing and operation for the end users, while having an adequate complexity to mimic the sophisticated structure and physiological function of an organ or a tissue to be adopted by the market. Although, based on the works presented above, it can be established that the state of knowledge is currently insufficient to design efficient and realistic mimics. Automation and integration of OOC devices is another important aspect to be considered for transferring OOC technology from discovery to broad availability and adoption by industry for drug toxicity and efficacy tests. Indeed, commercialized OOC devices need to be multiple-organ-on-a-chip platforms which are integrated with various sensors (e.g., physical and electrochemical sensors) for real-time and continuous measurement of micro-environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, pH, oxygen level, soluble biomarkers, drug concentration and etc.) during a long period of an assay (7 days or more). Integration of a miniaturized microscope with such a platform, by providing in situ monitoring of morphological changes, offers a versatile tool for clinicians, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries [149]. However, to achieve this goal, effective collaboration between clinicians, scientists and engineers is required.\nAdvances in OOC technology have increased the hope for personalized medicine and POC testing. Since disease modeling and drug screening are the two main goals of OOC platforms, by using patient-derived samples (cells, tissue biopsies etc.) on these platforms, we can develop individual patient-on-a-chip models for POC application. Indeed, personalized patient-derived OOC platforms have the potential to accelerate time-consuming and expensive drug discovery processes. Hence, fast detection of the best approach for treatment brings personalized health care for individuals with genetic differences [6]. For instance, targeted drug delivery [159] and combination therapy [160,161] have gained great interest in cancer therapy to develop novel treatments. Direct and localized delivery of drug molecules to specific tissues or organs in the body enhances desired therapeutic concentration in the targeted tissue, while minimizing systematic drug side effects [159]. In combination therapy, clinicians combine two or more therapeutic agents or approaches to discover a patient\u2019s optimal treatment [160]. OOC platforms have the potential to play a critical role in the future to advance combinational therapy and targeted drug delivery assays specially for diseases like cancer, which time is crucial and there is no place for trial and error on the patient.\nFinding new therapeutics for rare diseases [162,163], which affect a small population, is another expected application for OOC devices in the future. Small market size and high expenses to develop new treatments for rare disease are the main reasons that most pharmaceutical companies are not interested in investing to develop treatments for rare diseases. However, in recent years, advances in biomedical technologies have increased the attention of governments and the pharmaceutical industry for drug discovery for rare diseases. Personalized OOC devices using patient\u2019s samples allow us to conduct trials on a biochip to tackle the challenges of therapeutic discovery for rare diseases.\nAs mentioned above, automation and integration of OOC devices with different sensors and microscopes by in situ and real-time data collection decrease user interference and facilitate the device\u2019s operation. Therefore, integrated patient multi-organ-on-a-chip platforms have the potential to be used by pharmaceutical companies and clinicians for POC applications. As reviewed above, these patient-on-a-chip platforms are required to recapitulate the complexity of living organs and organ\u2013organ interactions while keeping the device simple to promote the operation by users.\n7. Conclusions\nAlong with advancements in microtechnologies and the development of LOC devices in life science, particularly for POC applications, microfluidics have merged seamlessly with tissue engineering to develop OOC platforms which use building blocks of human organs on biochips to mimic organ physiology and to recapitulate organ functionality in vitro. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed before OOC technology finds its own place among other preclinical methods used by CROs, the pharmaceutical industry and clinicians. This requires effective and close collaboration between scientists, clinicians and engineers to bring this technology to the POC.\nWe believe that future OOC devices for POC applications need to be multi organ platforms which are personalized and use patient-derived cells or tissue biopsies to recapitulate the complexity of each patient on a biochip while keeping this complexity clinically relevant to facilitate their adoption by clinicians and pharmaceutical pipeline to accelerate patients\u2019 treatment.\nAcknowledgments\nN.A. gratefully acknowledges T.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

One story we\u2019re excited to share comes from Unlimited Tomorrow, a manufacturer of personalized, affordable prosthetic arms.\nThe traditional process of creating prosthetic limbs is costly and can take up to a year. For users who are children and may still be growing, this process can leave them with a prosthetic that no longer fits at the time of delivery. Using Siemens NX software, Unlimited Tomorrow is able to drastically shorten the time it takes to create a prosthetic. Unlimited Tomorrow makes it easy for users to order a prosthetic from the comfort of their home using a scan app on a mobile device. Once the scans are received, Unlimited Tomorrow designs a man/machine \u201csocket\u201d to fit the prosthetic to the patient\u2019s partial arm, 3D prints the prosthetic and ships it to the customer. They typically receive their lightweight prosthetic arm five times faster than the traditional process.\nHow additive manufacturing is reshaping the medical device industry\nUnlimited Tomorrow isn\u2019t the only example of how additive manufacturing can be used to transform the medical device industry and elevate patient care with high-quality, durable products. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to easily develop custom prosthetics, implants and orthopedic surgical guides that are as unique as the patients they serve.\nSimilar to the process of producing prosthetics, custom orthopedic surgical guides can also be created from patient scans and developed individually. Surgical cutting guides are used to limit cuts to a specific area, allowing surgeons to make precise cuts when removing a diseased or injured area of a bone before inserting a replacement. Traditionally, surgeons would use patient scans to determine the position and location of the cuts, then estimate what size of cutting guide is necessary. During the operation, they would then make the final decision about the size and position of the guide, selecting from a collection of generic sizes.\nWith additive manufacturing and modern design software, surgeons can use the same patient scan data to mold the cutting guide\u00a0to the shape of the patient\u2019s bone and virtually place it in the exact position necessary to make the most precise cut. The end result? Less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times for patients.\nAdditive manufacturing is also broadening the types of implant materials available. Traditional implants used in procedures such as knee replacements are bonded to the bone using a cement adhesive. This adhesive will gradually weaken over time, often leading to an implant replacement later down the line. Several companies are now using metal-based lattice structures to promote bone growth into knee, hip and shoulder replacements.\u00a0Lattice structures are three-dimensional arrangements of a material at a small scale. They form a scaffold-type structure that is lightweight yet strong. Medical companies including LimaCorporate have designed lattice structures that can integrate directly with new bone growth when used as implants. Unlike cement, this bond actually grows stronger over time, leading to long-term durability.\nEnhancing digital health security\nMedical devices are becoming a daily part of our lives, whether it\u2019s a patient using a device that connects to their cell phone to help manage a chronic condition, or healthcare professionals managing healthcare workflows. These devices make our lives easier and more connected, but they collect sensitive information that must be handled carefully. In order to protect patient safety and confidentiality, it\u2019s imperative that medical devices are secured against bugs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nSiemens Connected Care solutions equip medical device manufacturers with tools to improve the safety, quality and performance of their products. With our low-code application development platform, Mendix, and a robust cybersecurity framework, manufacturers can work collaboratively to build devices that enhance user experience and create apps for all forms of interaction \u2013 handheld to augmented reality. For the best user experience, our solutions improve device functionality and future-proof the software to ensure smooth upgrades.\nVisit Siemens at CES\nAre you attending CES 2024?

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The term \u201cDNA biochip\u201d is used broadly and includes various technologies: DNA microarrays, microfluidics/Lab-on-a-Chip and other biochips (such as integrated real-time PCR, mass spectrometry and nanotechnology-based biochips). With the abundance of gene targets and combinatorial chemistry/biology libraries now available, researchers need the ability to study the effects of diseases, environmental factors, drugs and other treatments on thousands of genes at once. Biochips can provide this information in a number of ways, depending on the type of chips and chosen design of the experiment. They can be used for pharmacogenomics that includes gene expression profiling, the measurement and analysis of regulated genes under various conditions and genotyping, the detection of polymorphisms or mutations in a gene sequence. Another major application for DNA biochips is molecular diagnostics, which includes genetic screening (e.g., detection of mutations or inherited disorders), identification of pathogens and resistance in infections and molecular oncology (e.g., cancer diagnosis). Biochips can also be use for high-throughput drug screening, chemical synthesis and many other applications.\nKeywords\nThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

TU Wien has found a way to develop a reliable standard for these tissue samples.\nBefore drugs are tested in clinical trials, they must be tested either by animal experiments or, more recently, artificially produced tissue samples. For this purpose, cells are cultivated, and tiny spheres with a diameter of less than one millimeter are made. However, the problem is that there have been no uniform standards for these tissue samples and no reliable method for producing them with uniform size and shape. Therefore, results from different laboratories are hardly comparable with each other, as the tissue size directly influences the behavior of cells and drugs.\nAn invention by TU Wien can now solve this problem: A biochip has been developed that can be used to produce tissue beads in precisely the desired sizes and supply them with nutrients or even drugs through a thin channel. A patent application has already been filed for the new biochip technology.\nBetter preclinical studies\n\"In preclinical studies, drugs are tested on small tissue samples to understand them as well as possible before they can be administered to test subjects,\" says Christoph Eilenberger, a doctoral student in Prof. Peter Ertl's biochip research group at the Institute for Applied Synthesis Chemistry at TU Wien. Carrying out these studies with higher precision means taking the next step faster and more reliably.\nMaximum scientific accuracy in these studies can save not only a lot of money but also a lot of time on the long road to producing a marketable drug. Well-defined tissue samples are also indispensable in other research areas\u2014for example, when studying the development of tumor cells or when ensuring the safety of food or cosmetic products.\nStandardizing size and shape\n\"The size of the samples is a crucial factor in all these studies,\" says Mario Rothbauer, a postdoc at the Institute of Applied Synthesis Chemistry. \"If the tissue consists of only a few cells, the environmental conditions are practically the same for all cells. For tissue spheres with a slightly larger diameter, differences begin to play a greater role, for example, when the concentration of certain chemicals is not the same everywhere.\" Therefore, experiments are only comparable if you precisely standardize the size and shape of the tissue samples.\nThe biochip team at TU Wien investigated in numerous experiments how this can best be done: \"We created cavities in our biochips with very different sizes and geometric shapes\u2014cylinders, ellipses, spherical segments. They influence tissue growth in very different ways.\" As it turned out, the radius of curvature is crucial; sharp edges are a disadvantage.\nSuccess was finally achieved with hemispherical cell containers, with diameters between 0.1 mm and 1 mm. \"Producing such shapes is not easy. We used microlenses, which are usually used for optical experiments,\" says group leader Prof. Peter Ertl.\nA whole series of these hemispheres is applied to the biochip and populated with cells. With a sophisticated system of fine tubes, it is possible, for example, to ensure that different cavities are supplied with varying concentrations of drug. This creates a precisely defined, standardized experimental environment on an area of just a few square centimeters.\nSuitable for industry\nThe new system was tested with different types of cells: \"In one experiment we created an artificial blood-brain barrier. In another, we tested the effectiveness of a cancer drug,\" says Christoph Eilenberger. \"This allowed us to show that our chip performs well in typical preclinical tests.\" The biochip is currently being used at the renowned Harvard Medical School, where Eilenberger is spending time abroad to research developed resistance of tumor cells to breast cancer drugs. The chip helps to standardize and replicate the patient's specific tumor milieu with greater efficiency to make targeted therapy responses and predictions about the risk of relapse.\nThe design of the new method was designed from the outset for industrial suitability: Experiments can be automated, chips can be combined and stacked to produce and test large numbers of spherical cell samples in a short time. \"The system is ideally suited for use in pharmaceutical research,\" Mario Rothbauer is convinced, \"which is why we have already applied for a patent for our idea, and we are already in talks with various companies from the pharmaceutical industry who are very interested in our new technology.\"\nMore information:\nChristoph Eilenberger et al, A Microfluidic Multisize Spheroid Array for Multiparametric Screening of Anticancer Drugs and Blood\u2013Brain Barrier Transport Properties, Advanced Science (2021).

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?
