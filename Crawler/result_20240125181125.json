Here\u2019s how it works.\nWelcome to the next step in smart telescope astronomy: Unistellar Odyssey\nA new generation smart telescope that uses clever technology and software to bring objects from tens of millions of light-years away into view, all at the touch of a button.\nOn January 7 2024 Unistellar proudly unveiled the new Odyssey range of smart telescopes at the world's biggest tech show, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024, held in Las Vegas.\nSmart telescopes are here, and they are here to stay \u2014 with numerous optics brands battling it out to come up with the very best smart telescope or intelligent home observation station.\nUnistellar boasts that the Odyssey stands out as the first smart telescope that can observe both nearby planets and objects situated tens of millions of lightyears away at the touch of a button, thanks to its patented Multi-Depth Technology, which we'll touch on later. Unistellar states you'll be able to explore the characteristics of Jupiter and seamlessly switch to exploring the spiral arms of the Whirlpool Galaxy with your own 'celestial co-pilot,' controlled with the purpose-built Unistellar app.\nThis isn't the only Smart Telescope to be unveiled at CES, and while it is still out of reach for those on tight budgets, it is a touch cheaper than the likes of the (also newly unveiled) Celestron Origin.\nWe've previously reviewed the Unistellar eQuinox 2 and the Unistellar eVscope 2 \u2014 both scoring 4.5/5 stars, and we're currently in the process of reviewing the Odyssey Pro, so stay tuned as we'll share our findings and photos here at Space.com once we've amassed several nights under the stars.\nThe Odyssey range\nThere are two versions of Odyssey telescopes, the Odyssey and the Odyssey Pro and they're both available to buy right now. They both allow users to observe the image the night sky through the Unistellar smartphone app but there are a few key differences between models.\nThe Odyssey, which retails at $2499, lets users see the 3.4MP images using a tablet or phone. It weighs just 14.3 lb fully assembled and ships with a handy USB-A and USB-C rechargeable battery, giving astronomers an average run time of five hours.\nThe ODYSSEY Pro, $3999, features a digital eyepiece co-developed with Nikon; this is the main difference and a slightly better 4.1 MP image resolution.\nA top-tier Odyssey Pro Red Edition is also available for those who value the stylish aesthetics of a colorful tube, and those interested will be dropping $4499 for the privilege. It's the same specs as the Pro, but red.\nBoth ODYSSEY models have a focal length of 320mm and a focal ratio of f/3.9. The total kit weight is a tiny 14.3 lb when compared to the likes of the Celestron Origin, which is a hefty 41.6 lb.\nWhat does the Unistellar Odyssey do?\nThere's a whole heap of clever tech bundled into these instruments, but the culmination of it all is that the scope promises to deliver a breathtaking astronomy experience as soon as you've turned the scope on and connected it with the smartphone app. You'll be able to find, view and photograph any object in the Celestial Database of 5000+ objects, as well as 37 Million stars.\nThe Unistellar Odyssey Pro utilizes Nikon High Precision Optics, which, simply put, means you don't have to make any manual adjustments to the mirrors; they will always be perfectly aligned regardless of external factors that would usually cause misalignment\u2014 this is the first range of mirror telescopes with this functionality.\nThe Multi-Depth Technology lets skywatchers observe both nearby planets and far-away galaxies without having to change instruments. The image you see is a result of a rapid succession of shots, which are then combined and processed by Unistellar's planetary observation algorithm to produce a sharp and detailed image.\nThe scopes also utilize deep sky binning. Seasoned astrophotographers will be familiar with this term, but it just means the combining of nearby pixels into a single larger pixel, creating a better signal-to-noise ratio in an attempt to get better quality images of faint, distant objects.\nEach time the Odyssey is instructed to point at a new target, it uses Stellar Autofocus, a fully automated focus system consisting of a smart algorithm and a motorized sensor, which is designed to create a sharp visual of objects light-years away. Once it's locked onto a target, it won't need to refocus. We've been testing this out for a few nights already with some mixed results, but the complete automated process really excites us and this could be the next step for all smart telescopes as we move toward automation in some consumer astronomy.\nThere's also Deep Dark Technology that restores a cleaner black sky to your images by filtering out light pollution like city lights, and there's Dynamic Signal Amplification, which helps deliver 'stunning clarity and color.'\nWho are Unistellar?\nUnistellar are award-winning telescope creators and work alongside their collaborators NASA, the SETI Institute (research organization in the Silicon Valley), and Nikon, with a mission to allow astronomers of any skill level to access the cosmos. The telescopes are designed to be intuitive, with simplicity at the forefront of their design process.\nIf you're a traditionalist astronomer who wants a less automated approach to skywatching and astrophotography, check out the best telescopes and best cameras for astrophotography.\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

Here\u2019s how it works.\nUnistellar reveals new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes at CES 2024\nThe app-controlled observatory with no eyepiece gets more resolution, a new planetary mode and a wider field of view.\nFrench smart telescope maker Unistellar has launched two new smart telescopes at CES 2024.\nThe Unistellar Odyssey ($2,499/\u00a32,199) and Odyssey Pro ($3,999/\u00a33,499) join the eQuinox 2 and eVscope 2 in the company's four-strong lineup of smart telescopes. Both can be aligned and controlled remotely using a newly developed smartphone app.\nWhile Unistellar's two legacy smart telescopes \u2013 the eVscope 2 and eQuinox 2 \u2013 deal primarily in dim and distant deep sky objects such as galaxies, nebula, and star clusters, the Odyssey and Odyssey Pro can also image the solar system. Unistellar also reports that it has surpassed 10,000 sales of its smart telescopes.\nBoth the new smart telescopes are 3.35-inch/85mm reflector telescopes with a focal length of 320mm. Smaller and more affordable than their 4.5-inch/114mm reflector/450 focal length forebears, the two new smart telescopes use Unistellar's proprietary Multi-Depth Technology, which allows the Odyssey and Odyssey Pro to switch instantly from observing deep-sky objects to planets and the moon. They each have a field of view of 34 x 45 arcminutes and a battery life of five hours.\nWhile the Odyssey doesn't have an eyepiece, the Odyssey Pro adds one that, like the eVscope 2, has a Nikon-made eyepiece. The Odyssey Pro also increases the resolution of its astrophotography from the Odyssey's 3.4 megapixels to 4.1 megapixels.\n\"They represent the ultimate technological innovation in telescopes,\" said Laurent Marfisi, co-founder and CEO of Unistellar, to Digital Camera World in a press briefing. \"They provide people who are not familiar with astronomy or with space exactly the same kind of meaningful and emotional experience as people who already have knowledge about astronomy.\"\nHe added that the Odyssey and Odyssey Pro are designed to help people curious about the night sky but have no idea where to start. \"People don't know what's out there in space, so we're bridging that gap with an app that is easier to use and hardware that is super-powerful but even more user-friendly than before,\" said Marfisi.\nThe Odyssey and Odyssey Pro are available now from the Unistellar website. In April, Unistellar will also sell the Odyssey Pro Red Edition (\u00a33,999). Both the eVscope 2 and eQuinox 2 will continue to be sold.\nRead more:\nThe best telescopes\nThe best camera for astrophotography\nThe best CCD cameras for astrophotography\nThe best lenses for astrophotography\nThe best light pollution filters\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nJamie has been writing about all aspects of technology for over 14 years, producing content for sites like TechRadar, T3, Forbes, Mashable, MSN, South China Morning Post, and BBC Wildlife, BBC Focus and BBC Sky At Night magazines.\nAs the editor for www.WhenIsTheNextEclipse.com, he has a wealth of enthusiasm and expertise for all things astrophotography, from capturing the Perseid Meteor Shower, lunar eclipses and ring of fire eclipses, photographing the moon and blood moon and more.\nHe also brings a great deal of knowledge on action cameras, 360 cameras, AI cameras, camera backpacks, telescopes, gimbals, tripods and all manner of photography equipment.\nDigital Camera World is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

But what sets these devices apart is their ability to capture celestial wonders, not just limited to nearby planets but stretching far beyond, even in light-polluted city skies.\nLaurent Marfisi, Unistellar's CEO and co-founder, highlighted the traditional telescopic limitations: \"Normal telescopes struggle to reveal more than the moon and a handful of planets. Our mission was to craft a telescope capable of unveiling the mysteries of the cosmos\u2014galaxies, comets, and hidden celestial marvels.\"\nWhat makes the Odyssey range stand out is its patented pixel-binning technology. Similar to smartphone cameras, this innovation adjusts the telescope's sensor to switch between high-resolution capture for planets and enhanced light gathering for distant galaxies and nebulae.\nImagine viewing Jupiter in all its glory and then effortlessly transitioning to witness a distant nebula's cosmic ballet from the same device.\nThe beauty lies not only in what you see but also in how you see it. Unistellar's app complements the telescopes, automatically guiding them to celestial spectacles while providing captivating insights about the wonders overhead. Marfisi expressed, \"We wanted to weave a narrative about the cosmos\u2014each viewing experience comes with a story, a glimpse into the grand design of the universe.\"\nRed version of Odessey Telescope /Unistellar\nThe specifics of Odyssey and Odyssey Pro\nEnhanced with cutting-edge Nikon optics and an autofocus system similar to digital cameras, these telescopes promise crystal-clear images without the hassle of manual adjustments. Plus, they boast an ease-of-use feature: optical tubes that eliminate the need for regular realignments\u2014making stargazing more straightforward for enthusiasts and novices alike.\nThe Odyssey, priced at $2,499, and the Odyssey Pro, at $3,999, offer an escapade within reach. For those seeking a touch of flair, the limited-edition red Odyssey Pro at $4,499 adds an extra element of sophistication to the stargazing experience.\nAs reported by Forbes, Unistellar's Odyssey smart telescopes are rewriting the rules of urban stargazing, making the cosmic spectacle accessible to all, even in the heart of the city."
