This most recent equity investment brings the company\u2019s total funding to date to $43 million.\nThe investment will provide GRC with the capital necessary to continue to build on the growth and milestones it has experienced over the last year, including a collaboration with Intel, significant end-user deployments with GRC Global Alliance Partners Dell and Vertiv in the financial services, telecommunications, and HPC sectors, the establishment of a UK subsidiary, installation of the ICEraQ\u00ae Series 10 at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility, its recently initiated pilot program allowing data center operators to take liquid immersion cooling for a test drive, and last year\u2019s launch of the first annual Liquid Immersion Cooling Awareness Month.\u00a0 The new funding will also help GRC to continue to expand its international footprint and global headcount.\nLast year, GRC secured the Data Centre World Innovation Product of the Year Award. The award recognizes GRC\u2019s patented ICEraQ Series 10 immersion cooling system for its effectiveness in solving the problem of increasing heat loads in data centers and as a technology-based product aimed toward providing a brighter future.\n\u201cAs the AI, the VR and the self-driving industries are gaining traction, the high-density data center market is expected to grow dramatically,\u201d said Cha Gyu-tak, CEO of SK Lubricants. \u201cNot only will this equity investment in GRC maximize cooperation between the two companies, it will also help accelerate broader adoption of liquid immersion cooling by data centers and position us to be the first mover in the market, while helping us grow into a liquid-based thermal management solution provider.\u201d\nAccording to a recent report from the Dell\u2019Oro Group, revenue from the data center liquid cooling market accelerated in 2021 by nearly 65%, and in 2022 an additional 25% growth is expected. The growth is attributable to adoption from cloud, colocation, and telco service providers. It is also estimated that early enterprise adopters will accelerate larger scale rollouts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to partner with SK Lubricants, and this most recent investment will allow us to expand the important work we are doing to future proof the cooling infrastructure of data centers globally,\u201d said Peter Poulin, CEO, GRC. \u201cWith the increased attention on data center efficiency and more broadly proposed environmental reporting standards for organizations across the globe, the investment will also help GRC contribute to a more sustainable data center environment while having a positive impact on the bottom line.\u201d\nWhile air cooling has been the dominant cooling solution in data centers, there is a power-density and geo location point at which air cooling cannot compete with more efficient cooling methods. Liquid immersion cooling leverages higher thermal transfer rates to support highly efficient and cost-effective cooling of high-density racks.\nAbout GRC\nGRC is The Immersion Cooling Authority\u00ae.

This most recent equity investment brings the company\u2019s total funding to date to $43 million.\nGRC has been in the forefront of the effort to increase the use of liquid cooling in the data center industry, and the funding arrives as powerful hardware is prompting more data center operators to consider advanced cooling solutions, including immersion. The vast majority of data centers continue to cool IT equipment using air, while liquid cooling has been used primarily in high-performance computing (HPC).\nNew hardware for AI workloads is packing more computing power into each piece of equipment, boosting the power density \u2013 the amount of electricity used by servers and storage in a rack or cabinet \u2013 and the accompanying heat. The trend is challenging traditional practices in data center cooling, and prompting data center operators to adapt new\u00a0strategies to support high-density racks.\n\u201cAs the AI, VR and self-driving (car) industries are gaining traction, the high-density data center market is expected to grow dramatically,\u201d said Cha Gyu-tak, CEO of SK Lubricants., who said the equity investment will \u201chelp accelerate broader adoption of liquid immersion cooling in the data center and help us be the first mover in the market while helping us grow into a liquid-based thermal management solution provider.\u201d\nGRC submerges servers in a tank filled with liquid coolant, rather than using cold air. This approach offers potential economic benefits by allowing data centers to operate servers without a raised floor, computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units or chillers. The company was founded in 2009, and has deployed its technology in 20 countries around the world, with customers in high-performance computing and cryptocurrency mining.\nGRC\u2019s approach is known as single-phase immersion cooling. A related technology is two-phase immersion cooling, in which servers are immersed in a coolant fluid that boils off as the chips generate heat, removing the heat as it changes from liquid to vapor. Interest in both approaches has been gaining momentum with broader adoption of AI.\nPeter Poulin, the CEO of GRC, said the investment \u201cwill allow us to expand the important work we are doing to future proof the cooling infrastructure of data centers globally.\u201d\n\u201cWith the increased attention on data center efficiency and more broadly proposed environmental reporting standards for organizations across the globe, the investment will also help GRC contribute to a more sustainable data center environment while having a positive impact on the bottom line,\u201d Poulin added.\nThe investment provides GRC with capital necessary to continue to build on its 2021 milestones, which include a collaboration with Intel, significant end-user deployments with GRC Global Alliance Partners Dell and Vertiv, the launch of a UK subsidiary, an installation at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility, and a new pilot program allowing data center operators to take liquid immersion cooling for a test drive. The new funding will also help GRC to continue to expand its international footprint and global headcount.\nSK Lubricants is based in South Korea and specializes in motor oil and other oil-based lubricant products. The expansion into thermal management coolant fluid offers the company a potential \u201ccash cow\u201d business line for the future, while helping SK Lubricants commit to its ESG blueprint. SK said it will work with GRC to jointly develop high-grade single phase immersion coolants and liquid immersion cooling systems for data centers, working together to drive rapid standardization and commercialization of these systems.\nIn addition to supporting extreme power density, immersion cooling offers potential economic benefits by allowing data centers to operate servers without a raised floor, computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units or chillers. It also eliminates the need for server fans, which can also be power hogs.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nLiquid Cooling in the Spotlight\nIntel, Submer Advance Data Center Single-Phase Immersion Cooling for Chips Above 1000W TDP\nSponsored Recommendations\nWhat to Consider for Underground Duct Bank Runs\nData Center's Lightning-Fast Conduit Installation\nElectrical Conduit Elbow eGuide\nXpress Elbows Guide for Industrial Construction\nVoices of the Industry\nWhat is Hyperscale?\nLatest in Cooling\nData Center Liquid Cooling Platform, Program Innovation Heats Up\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nLiquid Cooling Heats Up Competition Between Colocation Data Center Providers\nWhite Papers\nTop 10 Ways to Drive Data Center Automation\nSponsored\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nAn Innovative Data Center Build-Out\nXpress Elbows Guide for Industrial Construction"

The pair make the case for sustainability, claiming it reduces the power needed to cool a datacenter as well as cutting operational costs.\nThe companies announced a multi-year project in January aimed at helping the datacenter industry reduce the environmental impact of digital infrastructure. GRC also received a $28 million investment from South Korean company SK Lubricants in March.\nGRC, co-author of the whitepaper, specializes in immersion cooling technology, and Intel also unveiled in May that it is building its own lab to qualify, test, and demo immersion-cooling technologies.\nCentral to the argument is that datacenters use approximately 1.5-2 percent of the world's entire electricity supply. Left unchecked, this could expand to as much as 13 percent in the next decade. This references work by David Mytton, a former researcher on the sustainability team at Uptime Institute.\nUp to 40 percent of this power consumption is estimated to go into cooling all datacenter infrastructure and, as the power density of processors continues to increase, servers are now pushing the limits of what air cooling systems can cope with. This chimes with what Cisco told our sister site The Next Platform recently, warning that some of the upcoming generation of CPUs from Intel and AMD are set to reach the threshold where air cooling is no longer sufficient.\nMany datacenter operators are aware of this with as many as three-quarters of are now thinking about the importance of sustainability as a competitive differentiator, according to Intel and GRC findings. However, the pair claim that datacenters have hit a wall in power usage effectiveness (PUE), which on average has been hovering around 1.6 for almost a decade.\nAddressing that 40 percent of power consumed by cooling systems is a start, and the whitepaper adds that the removal of internal server fans reduces energy consumption by 10-15 percent. The hot components inside the chassis still have to be cooled somehow, but that could just as easily be a system where a liquid coolant is circulated through heatsinks attached to components such as CPUs.\nInspur, supplier of servers to the hyperscale market, is now offering such a system as an option across its entire portfolio.\nHowever, Intel and GRC contend that full immersion liquid cooling enables more servers to be fitted into a given space. They are perhaps on shakier ground with the assertion that this reduces the amount of equipment such as switch gear, cabling, and stand-by generators due to the decreased power load, which they say means lower capex and opex costs.\nBut Omdia's Senior Principal Analyst for Data Center Physical Infrastructure, Moises Levy, told The Register this week that there are pitfalls to watch out for with liquid cooling, including the operational costs and procedures required for using this technology.\n\"People sometimes don't know they need a filtering system, they need software, they will be tracking the quality of dielectric fluids,\" he said. \"It's another type of monitoring which requires higher skilled labor.\"\nIntel said that as industries such as the cloud and telecom markets move to adopt liquid cooling solutions, the company is designing silicon with immersion cooling in mind, which means rethinking elements like the heat sink. \u00ae\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nSend us news\nOther stories you might like\nThe Register\nBiting the hand that feeds IT\nCopyright.

        "raw_content": "GRC Pushes Density Limits with Support for 200 kW Immersion Racks\nAt DCF we continue to closely track trends in IT rack density and its impact on data center cooling systems. That includes the high-performance computing (HPC) sector, which has been the primary venue for extreme density installations of 30 kW per rack and beyond.\nGRC (Green Revolution Cooling) has launched a new cooling designed for really extreme density. GRC\u2019s ICEraQ Series 10 immersion cooling module includes a coolant distribution unit (CDU) that can support up to 200 kilowatts (kW) of capacity using a warm water supply, and up to 368 kilowatts with chilled water. The design also allows ICEraQ modules to be positioned end-to-end, fitting snugly against one another so they use less floor space.\nGRC was one of the early players in immersion cooling, unveiling its first commercial offering in 2010. The Austin company is using a decade of experience to refine its immersion deployments with the ICEraQ Series 10 design to boost density both inside and outside the module.\n\u201cAs the next generation of data center immersion cooling solutions, the Series 10 builds on our successful deployments and customer input to improve usability and functionality, with an easy-to-use rack design and a clean aesthetic,\u201d said Peter Poulin, CEO of GRC. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to bring a new form into the market and we look forward to offering this immersion cooling solution to customers struggling with data center cooling challenges.\u201d\nNext month, the Series 10 will be deployed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which has been working closely with Austin-based GRC since its launch.\u00a0 That includes cooling for the GPU-intensive subsystem of the Frontera supercomputer, the ninth fastest supercomputer in the world.\nThe GRC ICEraQ Series 10 immersion cooling module for data centers. (Image: GRC)\nAI, Denser Clouds Boost Immersion Cooling\nGRC has been in the forefront of the effort to increase the use of liquid cooling in the data center industry. GRC submerges servers in a tank filled with liquid coolant, rather than using cold air. Servers operate in an enclosure filled with a dielectric fluid similar to mineral oil. They are inserted vertically into slots in the tank, which is filled with\u00a0 coolant fluid, which transfers heat almost as well as water but doesn\u2019t conduct an electric charge.\nThis approach offers potential economic benefits by allowing data centers to operate servers without a raised floor, computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units or chillers. Last year GRC raised $7 million to accelerate the development of its immersion cooling technology.\nThe vast majority of data centers continue to cool IT equipment using air, while liquid cooling has been used primarily in HPC. With the emergence of cloud computing and \u201cbig data,\u201d more companies are facing data-crunching challenges that resemble those seen by the HPC sector, which could make liquid cooling relevant for a larger pool of data center operators. Microsoft recently began using immersion-cooled servers in production as it seeks to manage rising power densities and heat in its Azure Cloud data centers.\n\u201cWith companies such as Microsoft adopting liquid immersion cooling for high-density computing applications, our vision of re-imagined data center cooling is further validated,\u201d said Poulin.\nMicrosoft is using two-phase immersion cooling, in which servers are immersed in a coolant fluid that boils off as the chips generate heat, removing the heat as it changes from liquid to vapor.

This brings the company\u2019s total funding to date to $43 million.\nThe investment will provide GRC with the capital necessary to continue to build on the growth and milestones it has experienced over the last year, including a collaboration with Intel, significant end-user deployments with GRC Global Alliance Partners Dell and Vertiv in the financial services, telecommunications, and HPC sectors, the establishment of a UK subsidiary, installation of the ICEraQ Series 10 at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility, its recently initiated pilot program allowing data center operators to take liquid immersion cooling for a test drive, and last year\u2019s launch of the first annual Liquid Immersion Cooling Awareness Month. \u00a0The new funding will also help GRC to continue to expand its international footprint and global headcount.\nLast year, GRC secured the Data Centre World Innovation Product of the Year Award. The award recognizes GRC\u2019s patented ICEraQ Series 10 immersion cooling system for its effectiveness in solving the problem of increasing heat loads in data centers and as a technology-based product aimed toward providing a brighter future.\n\u201cAs the AI, the VR and the self-driving industries are gaining traction, the high-density data center market is expected to grow dramatically,\u201d said Cha Gyu-tak, CEO of SK Lubricants. \u201cNot only will this equity investment in GRC maximize cooperation between the two companies, it will also help accelerate broader adoption of liquid immersion cooling by data centers and position us to be the first mover in the market, while helping us grow into a liquid-based thermal management solution provider.\u201d\nAccording to a recent report from the Dell\u2019Oro Group, revenue from the data center liquid cooling market accelerated in 2021 by nearly 65%, and in 2022 an additional 25% growth is expected. The growth is attributable to adoption from cloud, colocation, and telco service providers. It is also estimated that early enterprise adopters will accelerate larger scale rollouts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to partner with SK Lubricants, and this most recent investment will allow us to expand the important work we are doing to future proof the cooling infrastructure of data centers globally,\u201d said Peter Poulin, CEO, GRC. \u201cWith the increased attention on data center efficiency and more broadly proposed environmental reporting standards for organizations across the globe, the investment will also help GRC contribute to a more sustainable data center environment while having a positive impact on the bottom line.\u201d\nWhile air cooling has been the dominant cooling solution in data centers, there is a power-density and geo location point at which air cooling cannot compete with more efficient cooling methods.\u00a0 Liquid immersion cooling leverages higher thermal transfer rates to support highly efficient and cost-effective cooling of high-density racks.\nRevolutionizing Bioscience Research: Creating an Atlas of the Human Body\nMaking healthcare and life science (HCLS) discoveries is time-consuming and requires considerable amounts of data.

The report, titled \u201cLiquid Immersion Cooling Reduces Power Use and Drives Sustainability Efforts in Data Centers,\u201d describes the role cooling plays in energy use and can play in leading sustainability efforts.\nPowering traditional cooling infrastructure accounts for upwards of 40% of total data center energy consumption, and because 60% of the world\u2019s electricity is still generated using fossil fuels, few data centers are truly sustainable. Even with heightened awareness of this sustainability issue, the industry hasn\u2019t been able to move the needle in improving power usage effectiveness (PUE), which has hovered\naround 1.6 for almost a decade.\nThis white paper details the challenges of attaining sustainable power use in data centers utilizing legacy technologies, and demonstrates the benefits of liquid immersion cooling in overcoming these hurdles. With three quarters of data center operators focused on sustainability as a competitive differentiator, GRC outlines a path forward, allowing them to continue increasing compute resources, while also empowering\nthem to positively impact their carbon footprint. Reducing the power needed for cooling not only contributes to more environmentally responsible operations, but also decreases operating costs.\n\u201cThis white paper demonstrates the opportunity for data center operators to design an integrated ecosystem that enables them to more easily implement liquid immersion cooling,\u201d said Peter Poulin, CEO at GRC. \u201cWe know how immersion cooling improves energy use and decreases costs, permitting data centers to operate with more sensitivity to environmental concerns.\u201d\nImproving Product Quality with AI-based Video Analytics: HPE, NVIDIA and Relimetrics Automate Quality Control in European Manufacturing Facility\nManufacturers are using the power of AI and video analytics to enable better quality control and traceability of quality issues, bringing them one step closer to\u2026.\nHPC in the cloud is growing, ensure your organization benefits\nProjected to reach $11.5 billion by 2026, the cloud market for HPC workloads has seen a significant shift in buying behavior.
