These announcements underline Razer\u2019s commitment to minimising the environmental impact of all its operation at all levels, from raw materials sourcing and manufacturing through to administration and office management.\nRazer is delighted to announce that from 2024 onwards, all new PC peripheral products will incorporate recycled materials. This commitment encompasses all new product launches across Razer\u2019s mouse, keyboard, and headset categories, in Razer\u2019s signature black colorway, and is part of a multi-year plan to introduce recycled materials into all new products.\nThis new initiative was tested on two existing products, the DeathAdder V2 X HyperSpeed, with 40% recycled materials, and the Ornata V3 with at least 20% recycled materials. Thanks to Razer\u2019s efforts, both products received the coveted UL2809 Recycled Content Validation, an independently verified ecolabel certification from the World\u2019s leading testing, inspection and certification company, UL Solutions. Along with including recycled materials, Razer is also experimenting with using more recyclable materials, minimising the end-of-life environmental impact of each product.\nRazer\u2019s second sustainability announcement follows in the footsteps of RazerCon 2023, where Razer announced it had submitted two products for the world\u2019s first Environmental Product Declaration to UL. Today Razer announces that the Basilisk V3 Pro and Basilisk Ultimate are the world\u2019s first consumer electronics products to be certified with an Environmental Product Declaration by UL Solutions.\nThe Environmental Product Declaration enables consumers to make an informed choice about their purchases by displaying the carbon footprint, water, mineral, and fossil resource usage of each product, on the product packaging. Razer has succeeded in bringing gamers premium quality, high performance, innovative products while meeting the stringent standards for the Product Category Rules. Razer will build on this early success with more products being submitted in the future.\nFor more information on Sustainability at Razer, please visit Razer.com/go-green.\nUnveiling New Updates for Razer Axon, with The New Synapse and the Chroma App Now Available in Open-Beta\nContinuing its tradition of software excellence, Razer announces new advancements in its software suite at CES 2024.\nThe updates focus on enhancing user experience and expanding functionality, aligning with Razer\u2019s innovative approach to gaming technology.\nThese latest software updates underscore Razer\u2019s dedication to innovation, offering gamers and creators advanced tools for unparalleled performance and customization.\nContinuing to push the boundaries of gaming innovation, Razer remains at the forefront of delivering extraordinary experiences that define the future of gaming.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 First Look: Razer Kicks Off Next Wave of Blade Gaming Laptops With 16-Incher\nWe check out Razer's upcoming line of Blade gaming laptops, starting with the Razer Blade 16, which is available now. Check it out below.\nI\u2019m one of the consumer PC experts at PCMag, with a particular love for PC gaming. I've played games on my computer for as long as I can remember, which eventually (as it does for many) led me to building and upgrading my own desktop. Through my years here, I've tested and reviewed many, many dozens of laptops and desktops, and I am always happy to recommend a PC for your needs and budget.\nRazer has cut into CES 2024 with updates to three of its signature Blade gaming laptops, now with advanced displays and new components for the Blade 14, 16, and 18.\nWe see this laptop line refreshed often, just about annually, usually by way of design iteration and the latest components replacing the previous year\u2019s best. That\u2019s true again here, highlighted by AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI chips hitting the Blade 14, a world-first OLED 240Hz screen coming to the Blade 16, and a 4K 165Hz panel inbound for the mighty Blade 18.\nWe were able to get a closer look at these laptops in a meeting with Razer at CES, which you can watch in the video above.\nBlade 14: Portable Gaming Meets Ryzen AI\nStarting with the smallest and working our way down, the portability-focused Blade 14 maintains its compact build and focuses on updating processing. The 2024 model measures 0.71 inches thick and weighs 4 pounds, the same as last year\u2019s edition, despite the change in internals.\nAs for those parts, the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS processor is the star of the show, part of AMD\u2019s latest 8000 series. In addition to the expected improved speeds, this generation includes the ability to run AI tasks locally. That has been a big story this CES, with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chips, too\u2014we just see far fewer AMD-based laptops.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to test these AMD chips extensively ourselves to see what they can do, but the Blade 14 should be more than capable, especially for a laptop this size. Joining Ryzen is Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics up to the RTX 4070 at up to 140 watts (W) total graphics power (TGP).\nThe display may be small for some, as always with a 14-inch gaming machine, but that\u2019s the price of true portability. While smaller, the display still features a QHD+ (2,560 by 1,600) resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, well-suited to the enthusiast crowd, and a screen that the RTX 4070 is capable of pushing across many titles.\nThe Blade 14 is available for pre-order starting on Jan. 23, with pricing details yet to be announced.\nBlade 16: High-Refresh OLED Joins the Party\nThe middle child of the trio is arguably the biggest highlight this time around. At this point, 16-inch gaming laptops have all but replaced traditional 15-inch machines in a lot of lineups. We found the 16-inch 2023 model to be expensive for the performance compared with similarly sized gaming machines.\nRazer's display is the main draw in the 2024 edition, though the updated components may take the cake for many gamers. The new 16-inch QHD+ display uses OLED technology and a 240Hz refresh rate; the latter has previously limited the former due to panel availability and more limited permutations than traditional screens, but the combinations are widening, making super-fast OLEDs possible.\nThe vibrancy of OLED displays can now be enjoyed in high-refresh gaming scenarios on a larger screen, though such technology is still firmly in the premium price realm. You'll also find a dual-mode mini LED display option available, which can switch between high-resolution (4K UHD+, 120Hz) and higher-refresh (FHD+, 240Hz) as desired.\nAs for those components, the Blade 16 runs on up to the Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, the top-tier chip in Intel\u2019s latest 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d line. No new mobile GPUs were announced at CES 2024, so the RTX 4090 is still king of the castle, and that\u2019s what this laptop tops out with at up to 175W.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nThe Razer Blade 16 is available now starting at $2,999.99.\nBlade 18: Bigger and Better?\nFinally, we arrive at the biggest Blade in the bundle. The Blade 18 debuted in 2023 as part of the first wave of fresh 18-inch laptops, and now it seems to be on the annual update cadence with the others.\nIn another world-first claim, the Blade 18 features a 4K 165Hz panel. Like OLED, 4K and super-high refresh rates were not an available combination for some time, but we see a much wider variety of panels today. For those who want this laptop for content creation and gaming, this gaming monitor-like experience may be your best bet.\nThe Blade 18 details are more of a preview at this stage, with no component specifics outlined at this time. It will feature support for Thunderbolt 5, and thus Intel chips can be presumed, but that\u2019s all we have for now.\nRest assured, it will have the highest power ceiling of the three Blade laptops for 2024. Release date and pricing are also yet to be announced, and will come later this year.

        "raw_content": "Home > News\nCES 2024: Razer Brings Game-Changing Tech and Future-Forward Designs to Las Vegas\nRazer, the leading gaming lifestyle brand, unveiled several exciting new products and concepts at CES 2024 that aim to redefine the future of gaming, including chairs, docks, and haptic feedback.\nRazer is a brand that always brings a solid lineup to CES, and this year is no different. From gaming chairs to docks to a massive update to their laptop lineup, Razer continues to push innovation year after year, bringing some exciting products to the show floor that showcase this quest for innovation.\nRazer Iskur V2\nPerhaps one of the more interesting announcements comes in the form of an update to Razer\u2019s gaming chair lineup. With its innovative lumbar support system, the Iskur V2 stands out from the original Iskur gaming chair. This adjustable system features both a spring-loaded mechanism that conforms to the user\u2019s spine in real-time and integrated controls to customize the lumbar protrusion and height.\nThese changes allow the Iskur V2 to provide unmatched comfort and ergonomic support tailored to each individual user. The combination of the reactive lumbar support with high-density foam cushions, 152-degree recline, and 4D armrests makes the Iskur V2 the pinnacle of gaming chair design. Its superior build quality with EPU leather upholstery also ensures both a premium feel and durability for intense daily gaming usage.\nRazer USB-C Dock\nThough a bit less flashy than some of the other products on display, Razer also showed off its smaller, more versatile 11-port USB-C dock, ensuring seamless connectivity for Windows and Mac users. It\u2019s built for performance across devices with 4K 60Hz HDMI, 7.1 surround sound, 85W charging support, and a lightweight aluminum design. This portable hub with universal compatibility helps maximize productivity and entertainment, making it a great addition to any gamer or creative setup.\nRazer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe latest addition to Razer\u2019s Gamer Room ecosystem, the Aether Monitor Light Bar blends vibrant Chroma RGB effects against walls with a 95 CRI front light bar spanning 60cm x 30cm at 500 Lux. Its dual front and rear-facing LEDs create immersive atmospherics, while capacitive touch controls and Matter compatibility enable intuitive adjustments.\nUsers can effortlessly modify brightness, colour temperature, and Chroma lighting effects through the Razer Gamer Room app. Crafted to complement most displays via an adjustable mount, this sleek lighting bar takes battle station personalization to new heights with its seamless smart home integration. Made to fit a wide range of monitor sizes and built with a secure and versatile mounting mechanism, the Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is a solid addition for people who want a whole new way to add light to their gaming setup,\nRazer Project Esther\nBeyond the standard products, Razer always manages to bring a special concept product to the show, and this year is no different. Project Esther is a gaming chair mat concept that showcases Razer\u2019s new HD haptic technology called Razer Sensa. Through a sophisticated software and hardware platform, Razer Sensa allows gamers to literally feel in-game actions, transforming gaming into a full-body sensory experience. The live demo featured vibrations and pulses that mimicked explosions, heartbeats and other effects that blurred the line between gaming and reality.\nWhile pricing details remain unclear for some items and others won\u2019t be available for purchase yet, CES offered a promising glimpse into Razer\u2019s future. Though Razer\u2019s lineup may not be as extensive as in past years, the bold vision and ambition displayed still impress me, especially with the level of improvements seen in these and their new Blade lineup.\nI will be eagerly anticipating reviews of these pioneering Razer products when they hit the market later this year to see if they can deliver on their lofty goals of redefining gaming experiences.\nKeep up to date on everything CES 2024 here.\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "Gadgets\nRazer's Cutting-Edge Upgrades, Sustainability Initiatives Unveiled at CES 2024\nRazer, the renowned gaming lifestyle brand, has recently revealed its latest advancements with the upgraded Blades series. This took place at CES 2024, where Razer showcased not only cutting-edge technology but also introduced a touch of luxury with its new accessories.\nDedicating to Sustainability\nOne of the standout features of Razer's commitment is its dedication to sustainability. In a significant move, Razer has incorporated recycled materials into the upcoming line of gaming PCs and peripherals. This approach aligns with Razer's vision for a more environmentally conscious gaming industry.\nAs the company sets the stage for the launch of this eco-friendly line of products in 2024,\u00a0 it not only emphasizes technological innovation but also underscores the importance of integrating sustainable practices into the gaming landscape.\nExpressing the company's commitment, Venture Beat reported that Razer's sustainability lead Kenneth Ng highlighted that modern gamers seek innovation and performance while remaining environmentally conscious.\nThe strategic integration of recycled materials into new products aligns with Razer's dedication to enhancing the circularity of gaming items and mitigating their environmental footprint. This initiative signifies a step forward in Razer's ongoing efforts to balance cutting-edge gaming experiences with a commitment to environmental responsibility.\nSuccessor of Razer's First Gaming Chair\nOther highlights in CES 2024 are the follow-up to Razer's inaugural gaming chair, an 11-port USB-C dock, a gaming cushion featuring HD haptics, and a monitor-mounted light bar equipped with Chroma RGB illumination.\nThe Razer Iskur V2 Gaming Chair takes center stage as the successor to the 2020 original. A standout feature of the new model is its 6D Adjustable and Adaptive Lumbar Support System\" touted as the only one of its kind.\nEngadget reported that this lumbar support employs a spring-loaded mechanism to adapt to the body's weight and posture, complemented by manual controls for protrusion and height adjustments in the lumbar area.\nDesigned with insights from ergonomics experts and esports communities, the Iskur V2 offers extensive customization, allowing users to recline up to 152 degrees and control the tilt.\nPriced at $650, the Iskur V2 is available for order on Razer's website, promising a combination of luxurious design and ergonomic functionality.\nHighlighting Blade 16's New OLED\nRazer eagerly shared details about the enhanced display options for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 on the 4th, and now, additional insights shed light on what to expect from these laptops in the upcoming year.\nThe revelations largely focus on specifications, including notable upgrades that align with the trend of elevating the numbers on the spec sheet. Additionally, Razer introduces a USB-C dock to complement the new laptops.\nThe standout feature of the Blade 16 is the previously disclosed 2560 x 1600 240Hz OLED panel. According to Razer spokesperson Will Powers, the Blade 16 will also offer the dual-mode mini-LED display tested in 2023.\nAs per The Verge, this dynamic display can operate at either 4K/120Hz or 1600p/240Hz, and the updated version includes a local dimming option that users can toggle through software.\nIn terms of performance, the Blade 16 receives a CPU upgrade from the 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13950HX to the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX.\nAlso Read: Razer Launches Lamborghini-Inspired Laptop for $5,000: Here's What to Expect\nWhile specific specs for the new CPU are yet to be officially released by Intel, leaked benchmarks suggest a similarity to the 13th Gen chip. The Blade 16 continues to offer up to an RTX 4090 GPU with a maximum power draw of 175W.\nFor those eager to get their hands on the enhanced Blade 16, preorders are now open on Razer.com, starting at $2,999.99.\nRelated Article: CES 2023: Razer Leviathan V2 Pro Soundbar has a Camera that Tracks Your Every Move-For What?\nSubscribe to Tech Times!\nSign up for our free newsletter for the Latest coverage!"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 First Look: Razer Kicks Off Next Wave of Blade Gaming Laptops With 16-Incher\nWe check out Razer's upcoming line of Blade gaming laptops, starting with the Razer Blade 16, which is available now. Check it out below.\nRazer has cut into CES 2024 with updates to three of its signature Blade gaming laptops, now with advanced displays and new components for the Blade 14, 16, and 18.\nWe see this laptop line refreshed often, just about annually, usually by way of design iteration and the latest components replacing the previous year\u2019s best. That\u2019s true again here, highlighted by AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI chips hitting the Blade 14, a world-first OLED 240Hz screen coming to the Blade 16, and a 4K 165Hz panel inbound for the mighty Blade 18.\nWe were able to get a closer look at these laptops in a meeting with Razer at CES, which you can watch in the video above.\nBlade 14: Portable Gaming Meets Ryzen AI\nStarting with the smallest and working our way down, the portability-focused Blade 14 maintains its compact build and focuses on updating processing. The 2024 model measures 0.71 inches thick and weighs 4 pounds, the same as last year\u2019s edition, despite the change in internals.\nAs for those parts, the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS processor is the star of the show, part of AMD\u2019s latest 8000 series. In addition to the expected improved speeds, this generation includes the ability to run AI tasks locally. That has been a big story this CES, with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chips, too\u2014we just see far fewer AMD-based laptops.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to test these AMD chips extensively ourselves to see what they can do, but the Blade 14 should be more than capable, especially for a laptop this size. Joining Ryzen is Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics up to the RTX 4070 at up to 140 watts (W) total graphics power (TGP).\nThe display may be small for some, as always with a 14-inch gaming machine, but that\u2019s the price of true portability. While smaller, the display still features a QHD+ (2,560 by 1,600) resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, well-suited to the enthusiast crowd, and a screen that the RTX 4070 is capable of pushing across many titles.\nThe Blade 14 is available for pre-order starting on Jan. 23, with pricing details yet to be announced.\nBlade 16: High-Refresh OLED Joins the Party\nThe middle child of the trio is arguably the biggest highlight this time around. At this point, 16-inch gaming laptops have all but replaced traditional 15-inch machines in a lot of lineups. We found the 16-inch 2023 model to be expensive for the performance compared with similarly sized gaming machines.\nRazer's display is the main draw in the 2024 edition, though the updated components may take the cake for many gamers. The new 16-inch QHD+ display uses OLED technology and a 240Hz refresh rate; the latter has previously limited the former due to panel availability and more limited permutations than traditional screens, but the combinations are widening, making super-fast OLEDs possible.\nThe vibrancy of OLED displays can now be enjoyed in high-refresh gaming scenarios on a larger screen, though such technology is still firmly in the premium price realm. You'll also find a dual-mode mini LED display option available, which can switch between high-resolution (4K UHD+, 120Hz) and higher-refresh (FHD+, 240Hz) as desired.\nAs for those components, the Blade 16 runs on up to the Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, the top-tier chip in Intel\u2019s latest 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d line. No new mobile GPUs were announced at CES 2024, so the RTX 4090 is still king of the castle, and that\u2019s what this laptop tops out with at up to 175W.\nThe Razer Blade 16 is available now starting at $2,999.99.\nBlade 18: Bigger and Better?\nFinally, we arrive at the biggest Blade in the bundle. The Blade 18 debuted in 2023 as part of the first wave of fresh 18-inch laptops, and now it seems to be on the annual update cadence with the others.\nIn another world-first claim, the Blade 18 features a 4K 165Hz panel. Like OLED, 4K and super-high refresh rates were not an available combination for some time, but we see a much wider variety of panels today. For those who want this laptop for content creation and gaming, this gaming monitor-like experience may be your best bet.\nThe Blade 18 details are more of a preview at this stage, with no component specifics outlined at this time. It will feature support for Thunderbolt 5, and thus Intel chips can be presumed, but that\u2019s all we have for now.\nRest assured, it will have the highest power ceiling of the three Blade laptops for 2024. Release date and pricing are also yet to be announced, and will come later this year. Stay tuned for fully tested review coverage on all of these Blades.\nAbout Matthew Buzzi\nI\u2019m one of the consumer PC experts at PCMag, with a particular love for PC gaming.

At this year\u2019s convention, the company has a follow-up to its first gaming chair, an 11-port USB-C dock, a gaming cushion with HD haptics and a monitor-mounted light bar with Chroma RGB illumination.\nRazer Iskur V2\nRazer USB-C Dock\nRazer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nRazer Iskur V2 gaming chair\nThe Razer Iskur V2 Gaming Chair is the successor to the 2020 original. The new model\u2019s highlight is its \u201c6D Adjustable and Adaptive Lumbar Support System.\u201d Described as the only one of its kind, the lumbar support has a spring-loaded mechanism to adjust to the body\u2019s weight and posture, alongside manual controls for the lumbar area\u2019s protrusion and height.\nRazer says it gathered feedback from ergonomics experts and esports communities in designing the Iskur V2. The chair can recline up to 152 degrees and lets you control its tilt. It includes high-density foam cushions and is made of EPU-grade synthetic leather. The company describes it as offering \u201cextensive customization in height, position, and angle,\u201d and it has a memory foam head cushion.\nThe Iskur V2 costs $650 and is available to order today from Razer\u2019s website.\nRazer Iskur V2\nRazer USB C Dock\nRazer also has a new 11-port dock compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, iPads and Chromebooks. On the port front, the Razer USB C Dock has four USB-A, two USB-C, a gigabit ethernet, HDMI, a 3.5mm audio combo jack and slots for UHS-I SD and microSD.\nThe dock\u2019s HDMI port can output up to 4K at 60Hz, and its audio jack supports 7.1 surround sound. The accessory is made from an aluminum alloy, and its USB ports support 85 W laptop charging.\nThe Razer USB C Dock costs $120 and is available today from Razer.\nRazer USB-C Dock\nProject Esther cushion\nFollowing its 2022 acquisition of Interhaptics, Razer is showcasing Project Esther, \u201cthe world\u2019s first HD haptics gaming cushion,\u201d which sounds like it could have been made from a CES-themed Mad Lib. The cushion hasn\u2019t been announced as a commercial product (at least not yet), but it\u2019s designed to flaunt Razer Sensa haptics.\nSimilar to the size and shape of standalone chair massagers, the Project Esther chair mat stretches along where you sit up across the back. Devs can control Sensa\u2019s \u201cdirectionality, multi-actuator experiences, and multiple-device integration between different platforms and peripherals.\u201d The tech is plug-and-play, automatically converting audio to HD haptics.\nThe chair offers \u201cwideband, high-definition haptics,\u201d thanks to 16 built-in actuators. It has adjustable straps, and Razer says it\u2019s compatible with most gaming and office chairs. (If it ever makes it to market, it could perhaps help the haptic-obsessed save money on gaming chairs.) It supports low-latency connections to ensure its rumbles stay synced without delay with your gaming or media content.\nAether Monitor Light Bar\nRazer loves RGB lighting, and the company has a new bar to prove it. The Aether Monitor Light Bar is a mountable accessory with front- and rear-facing LEDs.\nThe light bar has a Color Rendering Index (CRI, a rating of color accuracy) score of 95 and can light a 60cm x 30cm (about 2 x 1 feet) area. Its Chroma RGB lighting supports over 16.8 million colors and \u201ca myriad of lighting effects.\u201d\nThe bar also includes capacitive touch controls. Its brightness, color temperature and Chroma effects are all user-customizable. It supports the Matter smart home standard, and users can tweak its settings through the Razer Gamer Room app.\nThe Aether Monitor Light Bar will be available in March for $130.\nRazer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 \u2013 Razer Shows Wide Range Of New Products In Las Vegas\nThe only booth that we visited on the show floor at CES 2024 was Razer. Not because we didn\u2019t want to chat with anyone else there, but because they continue to be pretty much the only large company we work with that still has a large booth in the LVCC. Aside from the location info, we did get to experience some of their new products in-person at the show, and have provided at bit of info for each one in the following roundup.\nProject Esther\nRazer\u2019s Project Esther is an HD haptics gaming cushion meant to attach to your existing chair to give you some haptic feedback in your games, video, and audio content. By utilizing Razer Sensa HD Haptics, Project Esther can adapt to the content being displayed and provide a tactile feedback sensation based on the same intensity, speed, and duration as that being shown. A combined total of 16 haptic actuators are spread out across the cushion\u2019s landscape, in positions that Razer has determined will have maximum contact with your body in order to provide the best experience, and to allow for the haptic feelings to travel from one location to another nearly seamlessly. Adjustable straps on Project Esther mean it can conform to nearly any gaming or office chair, and connectivity is handled via a 2.4GHz wireless connection to your system. Power is provided via a power supply connected to the wall, as batteries would not be ideal for this type of product, according to Razer. We sat down in a Razer gaming chair that had been outfitted with Project Esther, and experienced a few demos to see just how it felt. To be fair, I am personally not a fan of haptic feedback in 99% of cases, so my experience may not be as positive compared to someone who prefers this type of immersion technology. That said, when running through a Mech Warrior demo, the different weapons types I was able to utilize each had their own distinct \u201cfeel\u201d to them when fired \u2013 the larger cannon was more of a deep, singular rumble, while the laser-type projectile had more of a prolonged buzzing feeling that seemed to match what I would expect that weapon to feel like. As this is still a prototype, we don\u2019t have any release info or pricing, but stay tuned, as I am sure we will cover it once more information becomes available.\nRazer Iskur V2\nThe Razer Iskur V2, is as you would expect, the second iteration of the Iskur chair, Razer\u2019s flagship gaming chair. This time around Razer has continued their work with top esports players and ergonomics experts to create the best gaming chair possible, with both comfort and ergonomics in mind. Your standard adjustment options are all found on the Iskur V2, but a few additional changes have been implemented to improve the second version. For example, there is a highly adjustable lumbar support pad that swivels left and right depending on your body\u2019s natural movements, providing support even when you aren\u2019t sitting in the most ideal position. Additionally, the lumbar support system can be adjusted up and down to match the curvature of your spine, and can push in and out to match your back as well. A precision control knob on each side of the chair is available for making subtle changes to this lumbar support option, allowing for the perfect fit. Both synthetic leather or cloth materials are available for seating surfaces, and the leather version comes with either black or green stitching highlights. Available now, the Razer Iskur V2 is priced at $649.\nRazer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nAble to highlight your desktop surface without lighting up your whole room, or rotating to act as a key light for virtual meetings or video content creation, the Razer Aether is a great option for adding both productive or aesthetic light to your environment. Compatible with Razer Chroma RGB, the Aether Monitor Light Bar can illuminate your gaming or work area with RGB-infused light, while providing practical light for your workspace, thanks to its dual lighting configuration. With a 95 Color Rating Index that is configurable from 2700k up to 6500k, you have a wide range of color temperatures available to match your preference across a 60cm x 30cm space. The Razer Aether is designed to work with both flat and curved monitors, so rest assured that it is ready to go for your setup, and installs easily in a manner similar to existing webcams. A touch control bar is available at the center of the light body, and offers a range of controls at your finger tips, including brightness, color temperature, Chroma effects, power, and a control slider in the middle for adjustment needs. Expect to see the USB Type-C connected Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar sometime in March for $129.\nRazer Blade 16 OLED\nMoving on to the real power of Razer\u2019s new products, we have the Razer Blade 16. This 16\u2033 powerhouse of a laptop sports the world\u2019s first OLED 240Hz 16\u2033 display. Packing an Intel Core i9-14900HX Series CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series laptop GPU (up to RTX 4090), Razer has produced a laptop with more power per cubic inch than ever before. The 16\u2033 screen utilizes a 240Hz Samsung OLED panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio, and 2560 x 1600 resolution. This panel offers a 0.2ms response time, 1 Million to 1 contrast ratio, as well as a 100% DCI-P3 Color Gamut. Razer has also provide a ton of connectivity options on the Blade 16, including multiple USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports in both USB Type-A and Type-C flavors, HDMI 2.1, Thunderbolt 4, 3.5mm audio, and an UHS-II SD Card reader. The Razer Blad 16 OLED is available now, with low-end configurations starting at $3,000.\nRazer Blade 18\nIf you need more screen real estate than what the Razer Blade 16 is offering, then look no further than the Razer Blade 18. As you surely guessed, the Razer Blade 18 offers the world\u2019s first 18\u2033 display with a 4K 165Hz refresh rate, and Thunderbolt 5. Yes, you read that right, Thunderbolt 5 \u2013 120 Gbps at your service. This laptop was a sight to behold, especially since Razer had is connected via that Thunderbolt 5 port to three 4K monitors and it was running them with no problem, and looked amazing. We don\u2019t really know much more about this laptop, but it should be available towards the end of Q1 2024 for a yet undisclosed amount.\nOur CES 2024 coverage is brought to you by Yeyian!\nYou May Also Like\nThinkComputers \u00a9 2024.
