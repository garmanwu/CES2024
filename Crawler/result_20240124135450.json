Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

Learn more here.\nCES 2024: Can Holoconnects\u2019 3D holograph boxes be the next-gen of programmed responsiveness?\nHolobox by Holoconnects, featured at CES 2024, goes beyond holographic gimmicks. It's reshaping advertising, transforming healthcare with detailed patient assessments, and enhancing hospitality experiences. The technology unlocks limitless possibilities, akin to the revolution smartphones brought 15 years ago.\nHolographs have been a staple of the future ever since the first sci-fi movies showed them way back whenever. Ever since then they\u2019ve captivated minds and techies have been trying to come up with cool and convincing ways of making it work.\nRelated: Check out all of our latest CES 2024 coverage here.\nFor a while, we seemed to have given up on holographic, relying more on CGI on account of we were getting most of our entertainment through screens anyway, but then, in 2012 at Coachella, Tupac made a holographic appearance that led a lot of us to question whether or not he had really died. Unfortunately, he did, but that just goes to show you what holographic technology had been doing all that time.\nWell, since then, 12 years have passed, and Holoconnects has taken up the torch in the world of holographics with their latest and greatest with Holobox, currently showcased at CES 2024.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look and see if we can tell immersive graphics from reality and find out what all the fuss is about.\nInstead of going with the gimmick, Holobox blazes the trail on the practical uses of holographics while having a bit of fun. As it turns out, there\u2019s more than one application for the new tech.\nRedefined Advertising With Holobox\nFor the advertisement industry, the arrival of Holobox ushers in an era of immersive and impactful brand experiences. It offers a mechanism for advertisers to create captivating 3D representations of products or messages, ensuring memorable interactions that can significantly boost brand recognition and engagement.\nI challenge you to forget the time a holographic person tried selling you a soda, go ahead, give it a try, I know I can\u2019t.\nHolography in Healthcare\nIn the realm of health technology, the Holobox is revolutionizing medical practices by introducing an innovative solution for healthcare professionals to actively participate in patient assessments and contribute valuable insights to potential surgeries. The holographic interfaces play a pivotal role in offering a more immersive and detailed perspective on patient data, empowering medical experts to conduct thorough assessments. One of the key advantages lies in the ability for professionals to remotely collaborate, enabling experts from diverse locations to virtually engage in patient intakes and share their expertise.\nThe Future of Hospitality\nIn terms of the hospitality industry, the Holobox is emerging as an innovative solution to enhance guest experiences. It offers a new way to provide concierge services, display hotel amenities, or even to act as a virtual tour guide.\nWould be nice next time I\u2019m walking around the hotel that used to be a mansion trying to find breakfast in the morning after a hangover\u2026oh don\u2019t act like you haven\u2019t been there.\nReally what the Holobox has done is more than what it\u2019s done. It\u2019s given us the equivalent of paper and pen with the freedom to come up with the new application for this incredible tech. You really are only limited with your own mind when it comes to this thing, so yeah, maybe we\u2019re witnessing the new revolution similar to smartphones 15 years ago, we might have a new take on reality, and yeah, i\u2019m ready for it.\n5 Smart home gadgets launched at CES 2024 you\u2019ll want to buy right now\nCenter Cam V2.0 review: this middle-screen webcam takes up less display real estate\nSkwheel One electric ski review: feel like you\u2019re gliding\u2014but without the snow\nCES 2024: will.i.am and Mercedes AMG flipped the charts with this futuristic automotive tech\nTransparent displays at CES 2024\u2013LG vs Samsung\nSmart thermostats your home needs before winter steps in\nMacBook Pro with M1 Max and M1 Pro: which one should you buy?\nLaunching a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign soon?

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.

At the same time, this crisis has catapulted us into adopting technologies that enable us to\u00a0collaborate in new online settings\u00a0or even to develop vaccines ten-times faster than ever before. Importantly, in the long run also, such technologies will help us\u00a0in\u00a0finding fitting solutions to such pressing issues as affordable and accessible healthcare\u00a0and a zero-emission energy system.\"\nTon:\u00a0\"It's safe to say that innovation is more important than ever before. It was with a visionary foresight that Holst Centre was established 15 years ago:\u00a0to accelerate\u00a0innovations by way of collaborative research programs with industry\u00a0that meet the needs of the future. Since then, the disruptive technologies that we developed have been enormously impacting.\"\n\"Take our research on OLED and flexible display technology. These\u00a0were\u00a0ongoing focus points of our research efforts\u00a0during the first ten years of Holst Centre.\u00a0Now these technologies are pointing the way in the smartphones of the future. Our research and innovations are also the basis for spin-offs and start-ups. A proud and recent example is\u202fLionVolt, which is\u00a0now producing\u00a0our revolutionary solid-state\u00a0battery. It\u00a0has a high capacity and fast\u00a0charging\u00a0speed,\u00a0based on disruptive 3D architecture.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"Another\u00a0good\u00a0example of our impacting technologies are wearables with health trackers. New product introductions like Onera's sleep monitor are becoming part of our everyday lives within no time. Yet, such products have been built on top-notch research and chip technology. It's technology that\u202fwe as users take for granted, but that has transformed the way we act in everyday life.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"Our vision is a long-term one. But to be successful and drive innovation requires\u00a0persistence and\u00a0focus.\u00a0You need the freedom to explore\u00a0and\u00a0potentially fail\u00a0in order to learn, and finally develop the right technology for future needs.\"\n\"And that is precisely what we are good at doing: we have a long-term vision and foster our research, our bright minds, our IP and our partnerships with industry.\u00a0Key has been our approach to R&D: we believe in the power of having the freedom to explore, while working closely with our industrial partners.\u00a0At the same time ensuring we learn fast and continuously move forward. In this way, we have become an innovation leader. Our partnerships enable\u00a0industry\u00a0to apply our disruptive technologies in successful, market-ready products in areas like wearable health tech, ultra-low power design and flexible electronics.\"\nTon:\u00a0\"Holst Centre\u00a0is focused on key enabling technologies that help us solve societal challenges. Take our ongoing research in the field\u00a0of hybrid printed electronics.\u00a0Over the past 10 years, we developed this technology in close collaboration with industry. It is now being applied in such products as IoT sensors, medical wearables and flexible LED foils.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"Another example of such\u00a0key technology\u00a0is our work on\u202fultra-wideband, also known as UWB. This high-precision and low-power positioning and tracking technology has recently been 're-discovered' by industry to bring location awareness to IoT products. In fact, since Apple introduced UWB on their iPhone some two years ago. UWB is hot! It became a 'must have' overnight\u00a0for many companies. However the use of UWB on all flagship smartphones needs to become more accurate and at a much lower power mode. At Holst Centre, we are designing next-gen UWB that has 5-10 times lower power and higher accuracy, and as such will open up way more IoT applications.\"\nTon:\u00a0\"What this teaches us is, that as long as our research roadmaps are well defined and have relevant themes, sooner or later there will be a demand for our breakthrough innovations and enabling technologies.\"\nTon: \"Our strength lies in innovation\u00a0with a disruptive character. Many of the elements of such technologies \u2013 including the materials used, production technologies and design \u2013\u00a0are\u00a0completely new as well.\u00a0Such complexity means that it can be difficult to develop technology on one's own. Know-how derived from different disciplines and companies is what is needed throughout the value chain. Also,\u00a0sometimes working with long-term roadmaps is simply too big a risk for industry to take.\u00a0That's why we have in place a shared innovation research program, where we work with multiple companies on a joint roadmap.\"\n\"By\u00a0jointly\u202fcarrying the risk for\u00a0and with\u202findustry, we are enabling future value-adding technologies. We iron out the technical bottlenecks. Our challenge \u2013 and it's something we are successful in doing \u2013 is to continually check if our vision still fits with societal needs and industry priority.\"\nTon:\u00a0\"Our vision is to use technology to excel in the domain of medical devices and enable solutions that move patients out of the hospital. In doing so, health management will become a natural and unobtrusive part of life. Importantly, such innovations will help make healthcare scalable.\"\n\"Wireless communication has always been key in whatever we've undertaken here at Holst Centre. At the same time, we've achieved much in the development of flexible electronics. Combining\u00a0wireless\u00a0communication with flexible electronics has already given us our\u202fhealth patches.\"\n\"Now that such advanced wearables measure health parameters from outside the body, the next step will be the ability to monitor parameters from inside the body using implantable devices\u00a0or via one's\u00a0physical\u00a0surroundings.\u00a0To this end, our 'old' roadmaps towards miniaturisation and low energy use, remain relevant to this day and beyond.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"Building on our strengths, we are moving towards more demanding health applications and technologies,\u00a0including:\u00a0artificial organs, implants, closed-loop therapeutics and stimulation. The same holds true for our enabling technology efforts, where integrated photonics\u00a0is a new kid on the block.\u202fThis technology has great potential for new health diagnostics, as well as for better accuracy sensing, and integrated Light Detection and Ranging remote sensing.\"\nTon:\u202f\"And, moving forward, as Kathleen mentioned, we believe in the power of photonics\u00a0for measuring a person's health more accurately.\u00a0This technology\u00a0allows us to not only measure the various vital signs, but also\u00a0measure\u00a0biochemical parameters,\u00a0determine\u00a0blood sugar levels, and detect\u00a0stress and \u2013 potentially even \u2013 inflammation.\"\n\"This means that, for instance, for people suffering from a chronic disease, such as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) or heart failure, we will be able to measure the effects of certain therapies over time in a home situation. It opens up new possibilities for personalised and value-based healthcare.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"Key to our success is the vibrant eco-system in which Holst Centre operates. After all, true innovations require innovative materials, production processes and more. So, in fact, you need a whole value chain in place to enable a new technology. Our close ties with industry make us stand out from other research institutes.\"\nTon:\u00a0\"And it's\u00a0here that\u00a0we also add value for our partners. For instance, we do pre-competitive checks to find out if there is a market demand, or expected to be one, for a certain technology. We also help to turn technology into a market-ready product.\"\n\"Taking the\u00a0Philips\u202fHealthdot: for this company\u00a0to have a viable, marketable product, new chip technology was required. So, we partnered\u00a0with\u00a0chip manufacturers to make a uniquely complex chip\u00a0for Philips. Similarly, a new production process was required to produce the dot. We found the right producer.\"\n\"We don't only do this for large companies such as Philips, but also for smaller ones with niche solutions. And, nowadays, if we can't find a company that can develop the things we need, we establish spin-offs or start-ups.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"At the end of the day, what remains paramount to us, is the question how we can accelerate innovations into value-adding solutions for society. Recently, we've been helping local authorities tackle one of the biggest problems and\u202flong-term\u202fcauses of death in our urbanised society: air quality. Based on our cloud-based sensor technologies, fine-grained, real-time air quality maps provide the tools required to closely monitor air quality and help facilitate smarter and healthier cities.\"\n\"Innovations that can cut healthcare costs \u2013 while improving patient wellbeing \u2013 similarly have a huge potential. For instance, our researchers have collaborated with the\u202fDutch Kidney Foundation\u202fin developing a\u202fportable artificial kidney \u202ffor dialysis patients, that fits into a cabin suitcase. This could make the\u00a0current\u00a0invasive treatment become completely redundant. But it doesn't end there: as nanotechnology continues to make electronic devices ever smaller, we can push forward even further. An implantable, artificial kidney will make an even greater impact.\"\nKathleen:\u00a0\"What we have learned at Holst Centre over the past 15 years, is that success is something that cannot be predicted. At least, it's hard to predict\u202fwhen\u202f the market will be ready to embrace a new technology.\u202fNevertheless, we have a\u00a0proud and\u00a0proven track record in designing many ground-breaking innovations, enabling business success for our industrial partners, our start-ups and society.\"\nPhilips Dr. Kathleen Philips is vice president R&D and general manager at imec in Holst Centre, Eindhoven the Netherlands.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Recap Report\nCES 2024 was back to pre-pandemic attendance levels with an officially announced number of 135,000 attendees. And over 4,000 vendors which were spread out across the city, from the convention center to Mandalay Bay, up and down the Strip. Restaurants were full and cab lines were busy.\nI blew into town for just a few days in order to visit with clients, see a few companies we\u2019ve been following, attend our 15th Annual Women in Consumer Technology Legacy Awards event at the Venetian Hotel, and dine with friends and colleagues. Here\u2019s my take on CES.\nWe\u2019ve been following Ossia for the better part of six years and continue to see real progress in what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer in wireless remote power applications. Ossia\u2019s booth was huge, it was packed, they announced six partners who will have product out this year, which means we are approaching real-world applications for this unique technology. Here\u2019s the short version:\nOssia\u2019s Cota platform is able to beam power from one location to another. In other words, the Cota transmitter (which nominally would be installed behind sheet rock, so not in view) would be able to power a cell phone from across the room. No wires. No docking the phone on a \u2018wireless\u2019 charger. Real wireless power over the air!\nHere is where this technology will really shine in the near future \u2013 one of the initial manufacturers they are partnering with are our good friends at Nice. Nice recently introduced their Sun Shades line of window treatment shading products (one of which won our 2023 Performance Home Award for Best Product!). Utilizing Ossia\u2019s technology, they showed a prototype of a motorized window shade that was powered remotely by the Cota transmitter. So, instead of clunky lithium batteries which need to be changed out and have never really impressed me as an elegant solution for remodels, designers will be able to hang shades and have them draw power remotely, over the air. I believe this will energize motorozed shades for the remodel market and be a real game changer.\nOliverIQ had the most buzz of any new vendor in the Smart Home space going into the show. Eric Smith, Will West and Glen Mella, who brought Control4 to life, are back with their their groundbreaking Smart Home as a Service (SHaaS) platform. The launch heralds a new era in the smart home by offering a subscription model with unlimited support and a user-friendly app for control and real automation of today\u2019s most popular smart home devices.\nOliver integrates hardware products in its SHaaS platform including lighting, security, doorbell, thermostat and smart speakers. \u201cAll the basic systems in your house can work together to make your life better whether you want security, comfort, energy savings or convenience,\u201d explains Eric Smith, Co-Founder and CTO of the company.\nPartnering with national and global service providers, OliverIQ aims to scale their SHaaS platform rapidly, offering comprehensive product support, unlimited online and phone support, in-home assistance, and security system monitoring. This model makes OliverIQ\u2019s SHaaS platform the first-of-its-kind solution that simplifies smart home device interoperability for the consumer. By uniting various connected devices through the OliverIQ software which will be embedded either in common household devices such as routers, set top boxes, or the OliverIQ hub, along with a single, easy-to-use application backed by round-the-clock technical support, OliverIQ will bring a reimagined and completely accessible smart home to the market.\nI ran over to the convention center to visit with my good friend Peter Weedfald, Senior Vice President Home & Consumer Sales & Marketing for Sharp Electronics Marketing Company of America. Peter gave me a private tour of their new Video Display products, including the new Aquos home entertainment display that is packed with exciting technology you really have to see to believe.\nBottom line: Sharp is delivering competitively priced displays with cutting edge technology, and on the high-end Aquos display, audio that forstalls the need for a seperate sound bar. Look for them this year across the country at select A/V retailers.\nPeter also took me over to the Central Hall show floor and their huge (and packed!) booth to look at the wealth of technology they are developing. Transparent glass for video displays, ultra-quiet appliances, minituraized sensors, etc. Sharp is on the cutting edge of so many innovations that we\u2019ll be following up with Peter this year on a feature magazine article and deep diving into the nuts and bolts of this amazing company.\nThe highlight of any CES over the past 15 years has been our Legacy Awards event at the Venetian Hotel that honors the most remarkable women in our industry. Listening to the achievements of these fantastic role models is riveting and the networking of attendees is off the charts. Bravo!\nSee our full recap here.\nThe Nobi Ceiling is a ceiling-mounted version of Nobi\u2019s award-winning AI-powered Smart Lamps that detect and prevent falls and monitor health and activity patterns, significantly improving the safety and well-being of older adults. The Nobi Ceiling offers the same combination of elegant design and cutting-edge AI technology Nobi is known for, ensuring older adults can age independently and with dignity. Already a proven care techdevice in the European market and senior living facilities in the U.S., Nobi also announced plans to bring its full line of smart lamps directly to U.S. consumers in 2024.\nI talked with Niels Coch, Head of Nobi USA and we discussed Living in Place and the interior design professionals who work in this space. Since they are also likely involved with lighting design, this seems like a great fit. So any of you designers looking for more info, visit nobi.life or contact Niels at niels.coch@nobi.life\nWe were only in town for two nights, so dinners consisted of our traditional visit to dine with friends at Bouchon\u2019s in the Venetian (always wonderful!) and new favorite Yardbird which is also in the Venetian. Yardbird has the most awesome fried chicken and waffles, so if you haven\u2019t visited, do yourself a solid and get there!\nYou may also like\nTidying Up\nHurricane Strength Coffee\nLand & Sea Entertainment\nEric Meets Eric\nBasalte \u2013 A Love Story\nA Glimpse of the Future\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Technology Designer."

        "raw_content": "Flexible OLEDs for Lighting Applications by the Holst Centre\nWhile OLEDs already have successfully found their way into display applications, the breakthrough in lighting applications is still pending. The reasons are diverse, but cost is one major point. Another reason is the current edge of inorganic LEDs giving reasonable design opportunities in many standard applications. However, there are applications where OLEDs could score, especially the flexible OLEDs. But even these OLEDs need to become cheaper to be applied widely. The Holst Centre and partners aim to develop generic technologies for large area flexible OLEDs which can be processed with roll-to-roll (R2R) technology. Process Engineer Tansim Baig gives an example and an overview of the current status of the development.\nIn collaboration with our industrial and academic partners, Holst Centre aims to develop generic technologies for large area flexible OLED lighting, including thin film water barriers, which can be processed with roll-to-roll (R2R) compatible technology with high yield. This presentation/ article will give an overview of the key technological developments that are required in order to realize such devices. Highlights from our work will be presented, including devices on plastic and metal foil substrates with solution processed multilayers deposited using our R2R line, large area transparent electrodes including printed metal grids, techniques for light extraction in flexible devices and state-of-the-art thin film flexible water barrier performance (black spot free flexible OLEDs after more than 2000 hours in 60\u00b0C/90%RH accelerated lifetime conditions). We will demonstrate flexible devices with comparable performance to glass-based commercially available devices.\nIntroduction\nOrganic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) have gathered a lot of interest both from industry as well as academia since their discovery. Today, OLEDs are being used in displays of handheld mobile devices and for general lighting. Flexible, lightweight and with large area emissions in almost any shape, OLEDs will let us do more with light than ever before \u2013 opening up new designs and applications. And with lighting currently using around 20% of the world\u2019s electricity, OLEDs\u2019 potential for high efficiency could save huge amounts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Holst Centre, and its partners bring together expertise on technologies such as flexible barriers, and large area printing to realize ultrathin, flexible, large-area and moisture-resistant devices.\nFigure 1: Cost comparison for different encapsulation strategies with their advantages and disadvantages [1]\nBarrier Foil by the Kilometer\nThin-film devices such as OLEDs and OPVs are very sensitive to moisture, so need a water barrier layer. Traditionally, glass/metal lids have been used to seal the OLEDs / OPVs on a rigid substrate and this resulted in higher lifetime but was expensive and difficult to scale up to large areas. Then came the approach to thin film encapsulate the device which meant reduced costs, improved scalability to larger areas and most importantly lifetime comparable to glass\u00a0encapsulated devices. At the Holst Centre we are developing a low-cost, large-area thin film based barrier technology based on a SiN-organic-SiN stack which offers sufficient environmental protection to fulfill lifetime specifications of OLEDs / OPVs depending on the application. Most important is to keep in mind the scalability of the process for large area flexible lighting modules. The following diagram gives an overview of barrier encapsulation strategies vs cost.\nFigure 2: Pinhole-pinhole coupling leading to black spot growth in the device [2]\nIndustry has widely adopted the multi-stack water barrier approach for encapsulation of flexible electronics but the main challenge has always been to avoid the pinhole-to-pinhole moisture diffusion. If the pinholes were coupled, that would create a faster channel for the moisture to seep into the device, thereby degrading the device and leading to the growth of black spots. The thin film, optically transparent water barrier developed at Holst Centre used in combination with metal cathode for top encapsulation of OLED devices on glass substrates has an overall water vapor transmission rate of 10-9 g/m2/day. This results in shelf lifetimes under accelerated shelf life conditions of 60\u00b0C/90% relative humidity of more than 4000 hours (approximately 10 years under normal conditions). For flexible OLEDs with a water barrier both above and below the device, shelf lifetimes under accelerated 60/90 conditions are already more than 2000 hours and research to improve this is underway. For flexible OPV devices, we have observed no drop in efficiency of the devices after testing for 7000 hours under 85/85 conditions, which should correspond to more than 60 years under normal conditions. The following plots give more information about the performance of OLEDs and OPVs when tested under accelerated shelf life conditions of 60\u00b0C /90% relative humidity and 85\u00b0C/85% relative humidity respectively.\nFigure 3: Black spot growth rate in OLEDs with different generations of Holst Barrier technology [1]For high-volume flexible applications, the barrier must also be flexible and mass-producible. Holst Centre and its industrial partners have developed a roll-to-roll system for barrier production. And in the last year (2013), the collaboration produced 1.4 km of a first generation of the barrier foil (just a single Silicon nitride layer), with an overall (including pinholes) water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) lower than 10-5 g/m2 per day. This is already good enough for PV applications. To develop the roll-to-roll system, the team had to optimize a number of complex issues including web handling, particle contamination, layer homogeneities and the hardware itself. The next goals are to achieve even higher barrier performance by depositing the full barrier stack, increase yields and boost productivity, targeting 300 m of barrier foil per day in a truly industrial-scale process.\nFigure 4: Plot showing feasibility study for S2S processed Holst Centre barrier technology for OPVs [1]\nFlexible Lumiblade\nFlexible OLED panels will enable stunning new lighting designs. In 2008, Philips took the first commercial steps in this direction with the launch of the Lumiblade OLED, a glass-based, non-dazzling light source sold as a component for integration into any design. Now, Philips and Holst Centre have developed a flexible version of the Lumiblade. With a 120 mm x 40 mm active area and thickness of just 0.2 mm, these demonstration devices deliver flawless white light at efficiencies of 47 lumens-per-Watt \u2013 comparable with glass-based Lumiblades. The flexible Lumiblade consists of a single polymer substrate with the small molecule evaporated OLED (processed in vacuum) sandwiched between two water barrier layers. The flexible Lumiblade device shows no signs of degradation after more than 2000 hours of accelerated lifetime testing at 60\u00b0C and 90% relative humidity. Work is ongoing to improve light outcoupling and the compatibility of the substrate with industrial process flows. Figure 5 shows the demonstrator that was developed in close collaboration with our partners\nFigure 5: Flexible Lumiblade made in collaboration with Philips, Dupont Teijin Films, Rolic Technologies, Roth & Rau and Holst centre [2]\nSolution-processed R2R OLEDs\nRoll-to-roll (R2R) solution processing using slot-die coating is a very attractive candidate for manufacturing OLEDs and organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules mainly because with this approach low-cost large area lighting models can be realized in high volume with costs per square meter lower than \u20ac100. We have been able to control the layer thickness and uniformity during slot-die coating and drying to give the 30 -100 nm layer thicknesses required for OLEDs with only a few nanometers of layer thickness variation over the device area [3].\nFigure 6: R2R processed Top-emission OLED on Metal foil measuring 8 cm x 8 cm. Inset: R2R processed Bottom-emission OLED on Metal foil measuring 17 cm x 25 cm\nFor a number of years Holst Centre has demonstrated the feasibility of making OLEDs on both plastic and metal foil substrates. In 2013, Holst Centre and its industrial partners made significant improvements in process conditions to boost device quality and yield. Using metal foils, researchers fabricated R2R solution-processed top-emissive OLEDs measuring 8 cm x 8 cm Through inspection and optimization of each step of the process flow \u2013 including material deposition, patterning and packaging \u2013 we improved conditions such\u00a0as processing speed, layer uniformity and contamination control. The fabricated device showed performance equivalent to small area (2 cm x 2 cm) sheet-to-sheet (S2S) processed devices.\nResearch on this process will continue at the new Solliance fabrication line in 2014 (a new R2R line aimed to improve throughput and yield of the solution processed devices), leading eventually to volume manufacturing in a production environment and affordable flexible electronics. This new line will enable cleaner fabrication of the devices and is equipped with two slot die coating stations making it easier to coat multiple layers in the same run. The new R2R line has been installed and first tests on the line have already begun.\nFigure 7: Solliance R2R Line\nConclusion\nIn order to realize the full potential design freedom of OLEDs for lighting at Holst Centre, we are developing robust S2S and R2R flexible water barrier technologies that will allow flexible devices with a long lifetime. We are also developing large area R2R solution processing equipment, and processes in order to produce such devices at low cost and large volume. We have demonstrated the potential of these technologies, by fabricating flexible and solution processed OLED demonstrators with very good performance.\nAcknowledgements: Holst Centre would like to acknowledge support from our industrial partners and from local, national and European funding.\nReferences: [1] H.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Here Are Some of the Highlights of the Consumer Tech Show\nCES 2024, one of the biggest tech events in the world, was a star-studded event featuring innovative technology everywhere you looked. From unfolding laptops to retro phone keyboards, there were creative devices, both big and small on display. Some of the technology on display at the Consumer tech show was released immediately for purchase while others presented concept ideas that were gearing up for a launch later this year, but the one thing they all had in common was a clear vision for the future of technology. We\u2019ve already discussed some of the earlier announcements, such as the Sony XR headset and the Samsung Music Frame, but those were just the tip of the iceberg at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nA Quick Review of Some of the Most Fascinating Tech at CES 2024\nThere were an unbelievable number of products announced and presented at the Consumer Electronics 2024 Show and keeping track of all of them is not an easy task. The range of products was staggering, and while XR/AR technology has been dominating the event, we\u2019re also quite surprised at the number of home gadgets that have made an impact during the event. While Apple made its Apple Vision Pro launch announcement and temporarily distracted us from the event, we\u2019re back on track to go over some of the most interesting products that were showcased at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nWacom Cintiq Pro Tablets Announced at CES Las Vegas 2024\nWhen it comes to tech that improves your work, the Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets are a true designer\u2019s dream. The Cintiq Pro 17, 22, and 27 refer to different sized versions that are available to ensure comfort for everyone, and with their Pantone Validated and Pantone SkinTone Validated displays, they guarantee a color palette that matches up to their real-world counterparts. With a slim bezel and a large screen, the drawing tool promises a 120 Hz 4K display with a 10-point multi-touch feature that gives you the control you need to interact with your projects as you work.\nThe additional announcement of the Wacom Pro Pen 3 as well as the Cintiq Pro Stand, one that is sold separately, guarantees a fully customized experience for users who want to adapt the device to suit them instead of the other way around.\nLG Signature OLED T\u2014The World\u2019s First Transparent TV\nIt\u2019s interesting that even one company decided to bring out transparent screen technology this year but two companies with a similar idea signal the possibility of a new trend. The transparent TV has been much talked about at the CES 2024 event and while Samsung also released its own MicroLED transparent screen it wasn\u2019t as evidently a \u201cTV\u201d release as the LG edition of the product was. With a new Alpha 11 AI processor built-in, the 77-inch OLED TV comes set in the Zero Connect Box that allows you to place your TV anywhere in the room, no longer confining the device to a wall or a corner of the room.\nThe LG Signature OLED T, the world\u2019s first 4k wireless, transparent, OLED TV unveiled at #CES2024\nVideo Credit: @LGUS pic.twitter.com/J9vzu8QpAW\n\u2014 Wevolver (@WevolverApp) January 10, 2024\nModular versions of the TV allow you to pick the wall-mounted set-up as well if you still like the traditional setting. Eliminating the gaping black hole created by a generic TV, the LG Signature OLED T allows you to refine your home aesthetic to suit your tastes without compromising on your viewing experience when you do decide to use it for the purpose it was designed.\nMSI\u2019s Claw Handheld\nGamers have not been ignored this time at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event either. The Asus ROG Phone 8 catered to the world of mobile gaming while MSI\u2019s Claw handheld console. With Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake chip built into it, the deceive sets itself apart from the others on the market currently still powered by the AMD chipset. This detail, just by itself, makes the device stand out among other gaming consoles you could consider investing in this year. Promising 500 nits brightness, the 7-inch screen showcases a 1920\u00d71080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate and runs on the Intel Arc Graphics card.\nThe Valve Steam Deck remains the most affordable and popular option, all things considered, but joining the ranks of the Lenovo Legion Go or the Asus ROG Ally consoles is no easy task. And yet MSI\u2019s Claw console seems quite equipped to make a mark in the market.\nRabbit R1 Pin\u2014Creating the Simplest Computer\nThe new gadget looks just as adorable as it sounds, but its multipurpose functionality intends to join the race to replace smartphones, a challenge that we didn\u2019t know we needed to take on. The mini device aims to replace the multiple apps you have on your phone and handle tasks by itself instead, promising to book your flights and order your groceries for you. By talking to the rabbits on the device, you can assign tasks that will be taken care of for you. You can also type out the questions by shaking the device for a keyboard.\n@jessechenglyu rationale for creating Rabbit OS and their own device instead of just another app is persuasive. It resonates with Alan Kay\u2019s insight: \u2018People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\u2019 I\u2019m quite convinced getting a Rabbit R1 as my next\u2026 https://t.co/QTGcPjEJHO\n\u2014 Jaeyun Ha (@jaeyun_ha) January 12, 2024\nUnlike traditional chatbots that only understand your intention, the Rabbit R1 pin will also learn how to respond and execute them. Once you pre-authenticate the apps on the Rabbit interface on your regular computer, your Rabbit R1 device navigates through your apps based on your instructions. Now we aren\u2019t willing to let go of our phones just yet, but we\u2019re quite fascinated to see the device grow, and we\u2019re not the only ones. The first two batches of the Rabbit R1 device, each one 10,000 strong have officially sold out within days of its launch. The third batch is now open for pre-order, with an expected delivery date around May-June 2024.\nHelio Ring Debut at CES 2024\nWearable technology is definitely having its moment and the gadgets celebrated at the Consumer Tech show were no different. Amazefit\u2019s Helio Ring tracks health data just like a smartwatch would, without being as clunky or obvious with its presence. The device works like a sleep tracker but also monitors your activity on the go, reflecting all your data on the Zepp App for you to peruse when you need it. Its electrodermal activity sensors can measure your skin and sweat responses to reflect on why you might be stressed, which is interesting to the more familiar heart rate and blood-oxygen saturation trackers. The compact device is lightweight and can apparently be custom engraved with a date or phrase as well.\nSay hello to the Amazfit Helio Ring \ud83d\ude4c Engineered for elite athletes who know that quality recovery fuels peak performance, this #smartring represents a whole new level of #BreakingLimits \ud83d\udd25 Ready to recover smarter & achieve more? Check out the comments for more info \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/llgCeqKYoR\n\u2014 Amazfit (@AmazfitGlobal) January 9, 2024\nAnother honorable mention for wearable tech at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event includes the XREAL Air 2 Ultra smart glasses, which are \u201ca brand new spatial computing platform designed specifically for AR developer partners.\u201d These titanium AR glasses are going to be a much more affordable alternative for people wanting to explore the AR technology available today.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nIf your phone screens can handle being foldable why not fold your laptop screens as well? The new Asus series at CES 2024 includes the Asus Zenbook Duo which has us quite fascinated but we\u2019re equally captivated by the ZenScreen Fold OLED display. For those who require multiple monitors for their work, taking their tasks around with them becomes quite difficult. The Asus ZenScreen Fold OLED does not compromise on its display quality but also ensures that you have a portable work solution that you can set up wherever you need.\nASUS Foldable external OLED display #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/SRQtGql9UU\n\u2014 Tomi (@GadgetsBoy) January 9, 2024\nWhether in portrait or landscape mode, the screen shows no signs of interruption despite the hinge in the middle. The 17.3-inch display offers 2560\u00d71920 resolution and covers 100 percent of the cinema-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. It also has an audio jack if you choose to use the device as a screen for your gaming adventures. Samsung\u2019s Flex In and Out phone also deserves special mention for the advanced foldable tech it brought to the event among its other offerings making it evident that foldable tech might just be the way forward.\nOverall, it appears the CES Las Vegas 2024 was a big success and introduced a vast range of technology that sets the bar high for the rest of the releases this year. It\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll hear about the Consumer tech show as a lot of the products that were announced are scheduled for a release later this year. Once those begin to arrive on the market, we\u2019ll be able to see how they hold up to these initial reviews.\nFAQs\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "Gadgets handpicked by our editors\nThe Best of CES 2024\nThe Best of CES 2024: 27 Pieces of Tech That Could Actually Be Useful to You This Year\nIn a trade show so often rife with pie-in-the-sky concepts, these products stood out.\nIf you buy something from the links on this page, we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million babies annually in hosptials worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with an FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s pulse, skin temperature if your baby has rolled over, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it, though insurance plans are not yet in place.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor, without the immediate alerts.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015.

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful. Variety is key here, and depending on how beefed up your audio system is, it can drive to most speakers or headphones, or integrate into an existing hi-fi system (there\u2019s a new HDMI ARC port, too, in case you want to hook it up to a TV).\nIt\u2019s also easy on the eyes, with a 6-inch FHD display and delightfully tactile knobs that make interacting with the R9 a dream.\u00a0Just add speakers, and the FiiO R9 will be music to your ears.\nBuy on FiiO for $1,499\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nChina-based tech startup Xreal joined the wearable AR race this year, creating smart glasses fit to give the Apple Vision Pro some stiff competition. They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here. The physical print on the front will be customizable when orders go live, so it can seamlessly blend into any style you\u2019re going for in your home, whether you use it as a picture frame, or for a modern art display.\nLet\u2019s talk specs: the Music Frame contains two, built-in woofers, two tweeters, and two midrange drivers, with waveguides that will really help create a depth of sound, especially for wider rooms. It\u2019ll also provide surround sound when paired with 2024 Samsung TVs and soundbars, or you can just operate it as a standalone wireless speaker. Samsung\u2019s Music Frame proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice style for substance, and we can\u2019t wait to hang it up and hit play at home.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Samsung for $TBD\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 is a 2-in-1 laptop that gives you the rare one-two punch of a laptop that can double as tablet,\u00a0and one that can run both Windows and Android. More is more here, and you\u2019re getting the display of an Android tablet with the keyboard base (hybrid station) of a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU.\nSmartly-engineered with a Qualcomm processor powering the tablet and the aformentioned Intel chip in the base, the two pieces can function independently when you need them to. When connected to an external monitor, the base can serve as a standalone Windows machine. Need a more portable option? Just snap off the 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from its base and use it as a tablet.\nBeing able to switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button is a game-changer, and the Lenovo is leading the way to full Windows-Android compatability with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5. Releases: Q4 2024.\nBuy on Lenovo for\n$1,999\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nIt\u2019s BBQ season year-round now with GE Profile\u2019s first-of-its-kind indoor smart smoker that\u2019ll let you inbue your own meats with festival-worthy flavor.\nNot only is this unique indoor smoker small enough to fit on your countertop, but it\u2019s safe to use inside, and won\u2019t fill your home smokey, alarm-triggering fumes. Break out your hickory and applewood chips, because the wood-pellet smoke is filtered through a tightly-sealed, advanced catalyst converter. With no filters to clean or replace, you\u2019ll get full-smoked flavor that\u2019ll infuse into your meats, fish,\u00a0 veggies, etc. and not your curtains or clothes.\nThere are five adjustable smoke levels, so you can tailor the\u00a0 smoke intensity to their preference. You can precisely control and monitor cooking through the smart app integrations, plus there are dozens of recipes available, too. A built-in probe also helps avoid overcooking or undercooking precious cuts of meats.\nWhile it\u2019s not necessary for every kitchen, wannable pitmasters will get a lot of mileage out of GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Amazon for $999.00\nMaster & Dynamic MW75 Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic has long been a go-to brand for audiophiles, but they\u2019re teaming with Neurable, an AI platform, to combine their premium sound with neurotechnology to help maximize your cognitive performance with the MW75 Neuro Headphones.\nThe Bluetooth headphones feature Neurable\u2019s unique neural sensors, meant to measure brain signals to help the wearer focus, destress, and improve their mental health (according to the brand, this is the first product outside the medical industry to use this kind of technology). Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to use the headphones in combination with the Neurable app to tack how activities impact your focus and get informed recommendations on how to optimize your day.\nMaster & Dynamic didn\u2019t skimp on the audio features, though. The MW75 Neuros get up to 32 hours of music playback when noise-cancelling is disabled (eight hours when ANC and EEG are enabled), and eight microphones filter out external noise for clear calls and noise cancellation. Their custom 40mm Beryllium drivers were also designed to produce a warmer, richer sound.\nMaster & Dynamic wants to make your listening experience smarter, not harder, and their effort paid off big time, with headphones that\u2019ll become your workday productivity and\u00a0destressing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Neurable for $649\nBelkin Stand Pro\nLivestreamers, vloggers, and smartphone filmmakers rejoice \u2014 Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro might just be the best mobile accessory of the year. While there have been iPhone stands before that used face-tracking during recording, the problem is they always needed to be paired with a third-party companion app to actually capture any footage properly.\nThe Stand Pro is a battery-powered, 360-degree swiveling iPhone mount that leverages a hidden weapon for ultra-convenient content recording \u2014 a little-used iOS 17 feature called DockKit that developer SDK intended to be used with iPhone\u2019s native camera app.\nThe device runs on battery power for up to five hours, so it\u2019s perfect for filming on the go. Bonus: when it\u2019s plugged into a battery source, you can charge your iPhone with 15W wireless charging. Bottom line? Content capturing has never been easier than with Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Belkin for $179.99\niGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine\nWhile kitchen technologies saw a major AI-assisted boom this year, from \u201cintelligent\u201d steak toasters, to two-minute, Keurig-style pod ice cream makers, that didn\u2019t stop the highlight from being iGulu\u2019s simple, effective home beer brewing tech.\nUsing the \u201celiminating as many steps as possible\u201d principle, if you can brew a cup of coffee, you can brew a pint of beer at home with the iGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine. Just add water in the top of the iGulu and scan a barcode to let the machine know which type you\u2019re making. There are packs for IPA, stout, wheat beer and ambers, and you can make about 40 liters of ale or lager. The machine will ping you when it\u2019s time to add each prepackaged ingredient, and then\u2026that\u2019s about it!\nIt just two weeks, your new brew will be ready to go, and it\u2019s then conveniently housed in a self-cooling keg so you can pour yourself up a cold one anytime you want. You don\u2019t need mad brewmaster skills to bring the pub home with you, and that\u2019s where this iGulu machine succeeds where other home brewing kits have failed.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on iGulu for $599 (Pre-order)\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Game Console\nMSI\u2019s Claw A1M is the first portable gaming console built with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chipset, and it might just overthrow the Steam Deck for handheld gaming supremacy.\nWhat makes this chipset so special is that it uses advanced AI algorithms (of course) combined with on-chip video codec support to beef up the video quality while streaming games as well as improving performance. The 7-inch touch screen display has a 1080p full HD resolution as well as a 120Hz refresh rate. There\u2019s also a built-in fingerprint reader for added security, and support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, which will be clutch for faster, more stable online gaming.\nThere are plenty of physical controls on the device, including trigger, macro, power, volume, and shortcut buttons. But the major selling point is the Claw A1M\u2019s battery, the largest of all the popular handheld gaming consoles, which MSI says offers two hours of backup under full load.\nThe mix of the battery and processing efficiency makes the MSI Claw A1M leagues better than what we\u2019ve seen from most other handhelds this year. Releases: Q1 2024\nBuy on MSI for $699+\nJBL Live 3 Series Earbuds\nWhile everyone was buzzing about Apple finally adding USB-C charging to the case the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) last year, JBL latest three pairs of wireless earbuds made their charging case the real star of the show.\nThe JBL Live 3 Series earbuds all feature a case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen that\u2019s more streamlined than ever, with a display that lets you adjust the volume of your music, change the EQ, and even switch between noise cancellation modes. As an added bonus, the case also functions like an audio-minded smartwatch, sending you messaging push notifications from your smartphone.\nOkay, but how do the earbuds sound? Well-balanced, with up to 40 hours of playback and support for spatial audio. While they share a lot of similarities with their predecessors, the Tour Pro 2s, the improved design and fit of the buds themselves just elevated the whole package.\nAdding screens to everything isn\u2019t always a recipe for success, but JBL\u2019s impressive earbud improvements combined with a savvy, smart case makes them stand out from the crowd.\u00a0Available: Summer 2024.\nBuy on JBL for $199.95\nCasio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 Smartwatch\nWe\u2019ve all seen smartwatches and fitness trackers that claim to be durable enough to withstand any condition, but Casio\u2019s tough-as-nails G-Shock Rangeman\u00a0GPR-H1000 smartwatch goes above and beyond, and could claim the title of the most rugged watch on the planet.\nThe key here is an all-new mud, sand, water, and dust-resistant design, which looks and\u00a0feels like having a tank on your wrist (it\u2019s also shock-resistant enough to survive the nastiest bump). Despite the old-school LCD screen, this watch has several smart features up its sleeve, including the usual on-wrist notifications for texts, calls, and reminders, along with an onboard pulse oximeter to keep tabs on blood oxygen saturation levels.\nMeant for not just living in, but thriving in the great outdoors, the Rangeman GPR-H1000 also feature Casio\u2019s Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing and temperature. if you\u2019re planning on doing some serious trekking, from hiking mountainous terrain, to off-roading in the desert, the G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 is the ultimate outdoorsing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on G-Shock for $500\nClicks for iPhone\nFor everyone who misses the days of clickity-clacking away at their BlackBerry-style keyboard, you can bring that same tactile experience back to your iPhone with this delightfully retro new keyboard case from Clicks.\nAnnounced just in time for this year\u2019s CES, Clicks Technology is a new company debuting with their eponymous Clicks keyboard, which is compatible with the most recent iPhones to start. Ingeniously integrated into a wraparound case, just slide your iPhone into the device (it\u2019s available with either Lightning or USB-C connectively), and start typing away. For typing at night, the keys are backlit, and it runs off the phone\u2019s own battery, so you don\u2019t have to worry about charging it separately.\nWith a dedicated keyboard, the Clicks case might make your phone too big to fit in your pocket, but it does allow for faster and more accurate typing than on a digital keypad. One less obvious feature: the case has a command button to give you shortcuts to your home screen or search bar.\nIf you\u2019re wistful for the long-gone days of physical keyboards, Clicks for iPhone is the case for you.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Clicks for $139\nAudio Pro C20\nSwedish brand Audio Pro\u2019s new C20 Wireless Active Stereo Speaker brings classic Scandinavian minimalism to the speaker scene, and manages to pack in more versatility than what meets the eye.\nIt can do just about anything with maxmilized functionality in a sleek package, including support for streaming over Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth. It also\u00a0has a built-in moving magnet (MM) phono stage for connecting a high-end turntable without the need for a separate phone preamplifier. A dedicated line-in input can also connect your CD player or cassette deck, and or you can convert the whole speaker into a mini soundbar for your TV with its HDMI ARC input.\nThe C20 has amplifiers with a combined output of 190W, all housed in an acoustically-tuned wooden cabinet.

According to Klipsch, all of the non-passive components here \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, with impeccable quality control.\nWhat does that mean here?

Typically, hairdryers rely on thermal coils to produce heated air that dries your hair, but can pretty brutal to your tresses over time, causing split ends and dullness. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s hairdryer also takes a page from Dyson\u2019s book and uses an ergonomic circular design to maximize airflow along with a powerfiul motor to reduce the heat level.\nBut that added ring of infrared light from the AirLight Pro\u2019s hairdryer helps water droplets dry on the surface of the hair, but leaves moisture intact within the strand. L\u2019Or\u00e9al says this can help dry your hair up to 30% faster, use less power than a standard dryer, and reduce heat.\nWhile there is a connected app in the works where users can customize heat preferences, along with a set of smart attachments, sometimes a few smart tweaks to existing tech can make a world of difference, and the AirLight Pro Hairdryer is a chic haircare update that deserves a spot in your everyday routine. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on L'Or\u00e9al for\nUnder $400\nLockly Visage Smart Lock\nThe future of facial recognition is here, and it\u2019s right at your front door with Lockly Visage, the brand\u2019s latest smart lock. While we\u2019ve seen everything from fingerprint locking to palm recognition locks this year, this is the first time facial recognition has been used in a consumer product beyond video doorbells telling you who\u2019s at your porch, and it\u2019s officially got our attention.\nAccording to Lockly, the lock uses binocular facial recognition through two 2MP-resolution IR sensors to unlock your door hands-free as you approach. The deadbolt will unlock when you are at least 2.6 feet away, and should do it in under 1.5 seconds. If that\u2019s a little too Minority Report\u00a0for you, it does also work with Apple\u2019s Home Key, and has a fingerprint reader for other home entry options.\nThe Lockly Visage can store up to 100 face profiles, so you can add friends and family to your home profile. unlock when you are within 2.6 feet and should do it in under 1.5 seconds.

The S8 MaxV Ultra also allows you to control the vacuum with voice assistant from another smart device, and add a new camera that allows for (you guessed it) AI-powered obstacle avoidance and video calling.\nThe mopping system has also gotten an upgrade here too, and the S8 MaxV Ultra combines a new spinning mop with the previous vibrating mopping pad for even better scrubbing power. The mopping pad can also vibrate faster (4,000 times per minute) for a super-thorough clean, and lift up 20mm to avoid carpets. The vacuum itself has an impressive 10,000 Pa of suction power, which is nothing to sneeze at either.\nIt\u2019s a hefty pricetag, but we doubt that any robot cleaner can come close to the sheer level of hands-free deep-cleaning you\u2019ll get out of AI-powered Roborock\u2019s S8 MaxV Ultra right now.\u00a0Releases: April 2024.\nBuy on RoboRock for\n$1,800\nSegway Xafari E-Bike\nSegway is killing it in the personal transportation sphere, with a sleek e-bike called the Xafari that\u2019s bringing some exciting tech to the e-mobility table.\nThe biggest draw here is Segway\u2019s \u201cActive Scene Perception\u201d tech, which the company says can adjust the parameters of the bike in real-time based on \u201cperception of the road conditions and the user.\u201d While we haven\u2019t seen how it works in action yet, if it does as promised, it\u2019ll be a game-changer \u2014 but it\u2019s a beast of a bike either way.\nThe Xafari geared more toward riders who want to something to get to work\u00a0and go offroad on. This e-bike has full suspension, a 750W motor, and all-terrain tires, including integration with mobile health apps. You\u2019ll also be able to track metrics like mileage and speed, although if you mostly just want to cuise and pedal for fun, the bike is equipped with speakers and music playback for a truly entertaining ride.\nSegway\u2019s Xafari practically begs you to get out on the road, and we can\u2019t wait to ride it out for a spin.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on Segway for\n$TBD\nSwarovski Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars\nFor the discerning birder, there\u2019s no better high-tech addition to the hobby than Swarovski Optik\u2019s AX Visio Smart Binoculars. These AI-supported binoculars can identify over 9,000 species of birds and other wildlife, whether you\u2019re hiking in the woods, or just sitting on your porch.\nWhile they\u2019re eye-catchers on the outside thanks to a sleek, elegant design from Marc Newson, under the optical hood, the binoculars are powered by an \u201cintegrated operating and object-recognition system\u201d and onboard neural processing unit. A built-in GPS helps the onboard processor decipher what type of species you might be looking at based on where you\u2019re located.\nWe guarantee avid wildlife watchers will want the Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars in their personal arsenal, as they also take pictures and video with a 13MP and 1080p video camera.

This isn\u2019t a traditional Wi-Fi router \u2014 it\u2019s a cool router.\nIt\u2019s also the company\u2019s first tri-band Wi-Fi 7 compatible router, with enough serious networking power and download speeds of up to 19 gigabits for the most serious gamers. It doesn\u2019t sacrifice ability for look, though, with immersive RGB lighting on its sides that\u2019ll give it a distinct look in any room.\nDid we mention how many ports you\u2019ll get here? Two 10 gigabit ports, four 2.5 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.0 port that you can use with a flash or hard drive. One of those 2.5 gigabit ports is actually exclusively for gaming, so if you connect a gaming laptop, PC, or console to the port, your traffic will be prioritized instead of fighting for bandwidth from other devices on your home network. The TP-Link Archer GE800 delivers maximum flexibility, maxmimum power, and maxmimum style, so you can just focus on your game.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on TP-Link for\n$TBD\nVictrola Stream Sapphire Wi-Fi Record Player\nVictrola\u2019s follow-up to its Stream Carbon turntable is a worthy premium upgrade for vinyl-lovers looking to go wireless with their audio setup. Dubbed the Stream Sapphire, it\u2019s the company\u2019s most high-end turntable to date, and has improved upon its predecesser in nearly ever way.\nFirst off, the turntable has more wireless streaming capabilities than ever, and it\u2019s compatible with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP). This means you can connect it to an AV receiver or smart TV for a wider variety in how you can play your records.\nThe Stream Sapphire also sports some spiffy audio specs, with a chic, bespoke walnut veneer plinth, an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge, and support for streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz). Although this turntable is really meant to bring out the best cadences in your vinyl, it\u2019ll also give you ability to use Apple AirPlay or Google Chromecast for Bluetooth audio streaming.\nCombining analog audio mastery with the convenience of wireless streaming makes the Stream Sapphire sound as good as it looks.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Victrola for\n$1,499\nWeber Summit FS38X Smart Gas Grill\nGrill titan Weber brought the heat this year at CES in 2024 with their new flagship Summit FS38X Smart Grill, which has a never-before-seen grill feature you might just fall in love with.\nThis new grill comes decked out with everything from a touchscreen that displays real-time data on whatever you\u2019re grilling, to internal sensors you can use to track the temperature of the food you\u2019re cooking so you can make adjustments on the fly.

Liked a supped-up thermameter, this handheld device is capable of measuring everything from body temperature to blood oxygen saturation, and that\u2019s not even the half of it.\nThe BeamO serves as a kind of\u00a0digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions, and according the company it can detect early signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more. Users can then share those results with a doctor via smartphone, and even \u201clivestream\u201d their stethoscope audio over telehealth appointments.\nWithings are currently waiting for FDA approval, but we\u2019re excited about BeamO\u2019s prospects, putting the power of an EmergiMed in the palm of your hands.\u00a0Releases: Summer 2024.\nBuy on Withings for\n$250\nXGIMI Horizon Max Projector\nThe future is bright for XGIMI\u2019s Horizon Max Projector, one of the most impressive projectors we\u2019ve ever seen.

The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements.
