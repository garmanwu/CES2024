But the tech showcased at CES 2024 includes far more innovative products in the category that can make a big difference in our mobile-first lives.\nAlso: Best of CES 2024: ZDNET editors' top picks\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAs expected, Qi2 charging has been the star of the event, with most companies shifting from MagSafe to Qi2 technology so everyone can take advantage of faster, magnetic, wireless charging, regardless of whether you're in the Apple or Android ecosystem.\nOther mobile accessories solved practical everyday issues, such as not having someone to film your video content, keeping track of your belongings, and helping you to feel safer.\nKeep reading below for the full roundup of the best mobile accessories we saw at CES 2024.\n1. Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nIf you have ever tried shooting your own video or photo content, you know how difficult staying in frame and getting the perfect shot can be. Belkin's new Auto-Tracking Stand Pro uses Apple's DockKit technology to elevate the average tripod experience.\nAlso:\u00a0This auto-tracking iPhone stand is about to make tripods obsolete\nThe stand adheres to the back of your iPhone using MagSafe technology, and offers 360-degree movement-tracking and a 90-degree motorized tilt to keep you in frame no matter where you move. An added perk: It even charges your phone. The product retails for $180 and is coming soon to the Belkin website.\n2. Safee Case\nWhether you are walking alone at night, taking your dogs out in the early morning, or you just find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, this Safee case uses MagSafe technology to attach to the back of your iPhone and serve as a protective device with several self-defense features.\nAlso: This smart pepper spray alerts your loved ones if you use it\nClick the button three times to activate a 130-decibel alarm, and share your camera views, microphones, and location with emergency contacts. Using this information, your emergency contacts can call the police directly from the app. The recordings can also be accessed from the application later as legal evidence. Safee won a CES Innovation Award in 2023 in the Human Security Category. The website doesn't seem optimized for English or sales outside of France, but it retails starting at \u20ac55.\n3. HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank\nIf you are deep in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, the HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank is for you. While this power bank can fit in the palm of your hand, it has a whopping 10,000 mAh charging capacity and can charge all three devices. Because it leverages Qi2, it can charge your devices more efficiently and quickly.\nAlso: iPhone MagSafe-style wireless charging could be coming to your Android phone. Here's why\nThe power bank has a bonus kickstand on the back, which makes it ideal for using your phone while charging, including for streaming videos or taking FaceTime calls. It is not yet available for purchase as it is a CES 2024 Innovations Preview, but you can sign up for a waitlist of interested. The power bank will retail for $130.\n4. Anker MagGo Bank (6.6K)\nAnker's MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) leverages Qi2 technology to snap onto the back of compatible Apple and Android phones and deliver up to one full charge. What makes it stand out even further is its ability to fold up and down to double as a phone stand, perfect for FaceTime calls, video streaming, and even a mini makeshift tripod stand when you're on the go.\nWith so many brands releasing Qi2 accessories, you may be wondering why this one specifically made the list. The answer is simple: I have already had the opportunity to test it leading up to CES and am a fan, so much so that I packed it for the conference.\nThe product retails at $69.99 and is available for purchase today.\n5. Mophie's Juice Pack\nSeeing this product invoked a memory of when, more than a decade ago, I had a charging case for my iPhone 4s. After a five-year hiatus, Mophie brought back its Juice Pack at CES, to provide customers with the nostalgic and convenient phone case charging experience.\nThe phone case charger works the same way it used to, simply snapping onto your phone to provide an all-day charge and an extra layer of protection. The battery case is compatible with the iPhone 15, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max, and the capacity varies from 2,400 mAh to 2,800 mAh, depending on the size of your iPhone. When I felt it in person, I was surprised by how lightweight it felt and by how slim it was, as seen in the image above.\nThe product will retail for $99.95, and pre-order opens in February 2024.\nAlso: Mophie's Juice Pack is back\n6. Scosche StrikeLine Cobra\nIf you are peeved by charging wires running wild and always making everything look unorganized, Scosche has a solution. The StrikeLine Cobra is a USB-C to USB-C cable that is magnetic, allowing the wire to stick to itself and remain in a tidy structure. The wire can even coil onto itself to serve as a phone kickstand.\nAs you can see in the picture above, the hold is pretty strong, as I am holding it from one section and the wire didn't unravel. The product will be available for purchase in Spring 2024 in black or white in three and six feet options.\n7. Catalyst Dog Collar for AirTag\nYour dogs have mobile accessories, too, duh. If you are like me and can't bear the thought of losing your dog, you probably already have AirTags placed on your furbabies to ensure that if they ever get out or lost, you will be able to find them and bring them back home. However, if the Airtag isn't in a protective case, the AirTag can get lost or damaged, which defeats the purpose.\nFor that reason, Catalyst unveiled its Catalyst Dog Collar for AirTag that perfectly accommodates the Catalyst Total Protection Clip-It Case, which is waterproof and screws shut, to keep the AirTag in mint condition.\nAlso: Protect your dog's AirTag with a new collar designed to hold a waterproof case\nThe Catalyst Dog Collar for AirTag will be available in black and blue and retails for $24.99. You can pre-order it today, and shipping begins in the middle of January. The Catalyst Clip-It Case for AirTag retails for $34.99 and is available for order today.\n8. Moft Snap Invisible Phone Tripod Stand\nAlthough Moft's Snap Invisible Phone Tripod Stand\nwasn't unveiled at CES, the demo left a really positive impression, so the product made this roundup. In the aforementioned picks, we have discussed the hassle that getting someone to shoot video or photos of you can be. However, taking a tripod with you can be\u00a0impractical. This product aims to solve that issue.\nWhen closed, the tripod stand sits on the back of your phone like any MagSafe wallet would. However, when fully opened, it acts like a mini tripod, great for snapping quick pictures or propping up your phone for a specific task. You can also choose to use it as a standard, L-shaped kickstand by not opening it all the way.\nIt retails for $39.99, and is available for purchase today in Jet Black, Misty Cove, Seafoam, and Sapphire.\n9. OtterBox Symmetry Series Cactus Leather cases\nThis case may look like an ordinary leather case, but it's actually made from a much more sustainable material -- cacti. OtterBox collaborated with Desserto to create cases from nopal cactus that are soft to the touch and protect your phone while still being more environmentally friendly.\nThe case is MagSafe, and OtterBox even has matching MagSafe wallets and Apple Watch bands that can attach securely to the back. The cases and matching wallets will come in the four colors pictured on the color swatch next to the case above.\nThe OtterBox Symmetry Series Cactus Leather cases are not yet available for purchase but will be soon on its website.\n10. Clicks Creator Keyboard\nThe debut of smartphones wiped the good ole physical keyboard from existence. However, Clicks Creator Keyboard allows your iPhone and the classic BlackBerry keyboard to live in harmony.\nThe case, which works with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, attaches to your iPhone to function as a regular keyboard and even supports iOS keyboard shortcuts due to Apple's native support. It even was recognized as a CES 2024\u00a0 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps category.\nThe Founder's edition of the case is available online for $139 for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro, and $159 for the iPhone 15 Pro Max in the colors BumbleBee and London Sky.\n11. Magmo Pro Call Recorder\nZDNET's article on how to record a call on your iPhone\u00a0consistently generates so much reader interest because Apple does not allow recording through the built-in microphone while you are on a call, and there really isn't a way around it besides recording from a separate device or using Google Voice. The Magmo Pro is now a third option.\nAll you have to do is snap it on the back of your phone, and then it can automatically record calls for you. There is also an option for manual mode, where you can slide the button up to start recording. The recordings are all accessible on the app, where you can also access AI-generated transcriptions.\nThe accessory was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps category. It is already available for purchase on Amazon for $129.\n12. Snap 4 Luxe\nAt first glance, this just looks like your basic pop socket, but by the end of the demo, I was so convinced of its value that I plopped one on the back of my phone. The accessory attaches to the back of your phone using MagSafe and nano-adhesive and can be used as a phone grip (the same way a pop socket would) with the added bonus of a kickstand.\nHowever, the game-changer in my opinion, is that it doesn't compromise your phone's MagSafe compatibility, making it possible to still layer on more accessories on top like a MagSafe wallet or charger. You don't have to choose between which accessory you have on, and the Snap 4 Luxe is so thin that even with a wallet layered on top, it doesn't get bulky.\nIt costs $39.99 and can be purchased now.\nRelated\nThe best CES 2024 tech you can buy right now\nThe best iPhone power banks of 2024\nThe best Apple deals: iPhone 15, MacBooks, AirPods, and more"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "score": 0.72842,
        "raw_content": "I saw the future of folding phones at CES 2024\nCES 2024 has barely begun, and I\u2019ve already had an exciting glimpse at the future of folding smartphones.\nSamsung is at CES showcasing all sorts of display innovations \u2014 including a ridiculous 3D gaming monitor. But what I\u2019m more interested in is Samsung\u2019s newest folding phone concept device. It\u2019s called the In&Out Flip, and it very well could be what future folding phones look like.\nAt first glance, the In&Out Flip looks a lot like a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5. It has a 6.7-inch Full HD+ display that can fold inside of itself to become a small, pocketable square. You\u2019ll notice that there isn\u2019t a cover screen on the outside of the In&Out Flip. Instead, it\u2019s just a slab of glass. How does a flip-phone foldable without a cover screen make for exciting future to look forward to?\nThe In&Out Flip\u2019s big trick is that it doesn\u2019t only fold in on itself \u2014 it also folds outward. That means you don\u2019t need a dedicated cover screen. If you want to keep tabs on your notifications, apps, and more without opening the full 6.7-inch screen, you can just fold the phone outward and have the main display transform into its own cover screen shape.\nIs this the most practical design for a folding phone? There are plenty of reasons to think not. The main issue is that the foldable screen is fully exposed if it\u2019s folded outward, leaving it susceptible to all sorts of damage. From a purely practical standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make the best sense.\nBut let\u2019s not think practically for a second because I think this new type of folding phone design is fantastic.\nFoldable phones are still exciting, but the industry\u2019s quickly settled on two general types of foldables: ones that look like a Galaxy Z Fold and ones that look like a Galaxy Z Flip. Samsung\u2019s In&Out Flip is a big reimagining of what\u2019s possible with the hinge on a folding phone. Samsung says it\u2019s eyeing the design for use in smartphones and tablets, and while there\u2019s no confirmation if or when we\u2019ll ever see this in a product you can buy, I really hope that we do.\nBut the In&Out Flip isn\u2019t the only smartphone foldable concept that I got to see. The other, very oddly named one is the \u201cFlip Liple.\u201d No, that\u2019s not a typo. In Samsung\u2019s own words, \u201cThe \u2018Liple\u2019 is a new design concept that combines the words \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018simple.\u2019 It aims to lower the price of the product and provide an easy user experience, similar to the existing Flip.\u201d\nThe Flip Liple also has a 6.7-inch screen that folds the same way a current Galaxy Z Flip does. However, part of the screen folds over the top frame, allowing you to look at the top of the phone to see the time, notifications, the weather, and other information. It\u2019s not quite as exciting as the In&Out Flip, but it\u2019s still another way Samsung is thinking about how it can change how foldables work.\nWill the In&Out Flip or the Flip Liple ever come to market in a phone you can buy? Maybe. Maybe not. Even if we don\u2019t see phones like these launch in the immediate future, I still find it encouraging to see how Samsung is playing with flip phone design. Especially coming off a year where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 were such\u00a0iterative updates, it\u2019s reassuring to know that there\u2019s still a lot of creativity happening with Samsung\u2019s folding phones.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 almost certainly won\u2019t incorporate this technology. But there\u2019s a chance the Flip 7, Flip 8, or Flip 9 could. I think that\u2019s an exciting thing to look forward to. I\u2019m glad folding phones are already so consistent, but I also don\u2019t want them to stop being weird. And I\u2019m glad Samsung apparently doesn\u2019t want that to stop, either.\nOura Ring Horizon Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\nMy appreciation of the Oura Ring smart ring is well documented, and I\u2019ve worn it almost continuously for more than two years. It means I am very familiar with both its positive and negative aspects and have a good idea of where competitors need to shine if they are going to compete, as it remains the smart ring to buy at the moment.\nIf you're using a Samsung phone right now, you have TM Roh to thank for it. He's been the head of Samsung's Mobile division for four years, overseeing some of the company's most successful phone launches. He's navigated the pandemic, an onslaught of high-end Android phones from strong competitors, ever-shifting consumer preferences, and lengthening phone upgrade cycles.\nI was offered the rare opportunity to speak with Roh, crucially right before the Galaxy S24 phones were unveiled, and get his first-hand take on how Samsung got to where it is today and what's next for the Galaxy S line.\nDemocratizing technology\nEverything seems to be more expensive these days, but it has always been a fairly solid and accepted rule that the biggest, most powerful Apple iPhone model \u2014 currently the iPhone 15 Pro Max \u2014 would be the most expensive non-folding smartphone you could buy, even in its most basic configuration.\nHowever, in a continued effort to steal Apple\u2019s thunder -- not being content with the 5x optical zoom camera and titanium frame -- Samsung has priced the Galaxy S24 Ultra higher than its prequel, giving it the dubious honor of being even more expensive than an iPhone.\nAll the big numbers\nthe Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (left) and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
