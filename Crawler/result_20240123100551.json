        "raw_content": "Home \u2192 Augmented Reality\nMagic Leap Enters \u201cChapter 3\u201d Stage of Enterprise XR Adoption Roadmap, says CEO and CTO\nMagic Leap's senior figures speak at CES 24 on \"chapter 3\" roadmap plans to drive enterprise adoption of XR devices\nPublished: January 18, 2024\nRory Greener\nLast week, at CES 2024, Ross Rosenberg, the CEO of Magic Leap, and Daniel Diez, the firm\u2019s CTO, spoke to VentureBeat on the current state of Magic Leap\u2019s roadmap following a busy 2023, which saw the firm undergo a major leadership shake-up.\nDiez noted that while Magic Leap did not have a presence on the CES 2024 floor, the firm was active in private suites to match its \u201cgo-to-market\u201d part of its outreach journey while also \u201chelping customers connect with specific use cases and understanding how they\u2019re using these technologies.\u201d\nMoreover, following Rosenberg\u2019s October appointment as Magic Leap\u2019s CEO, the company is seemingly revitalising its roadmap for 2024, targeting its XR devices towards enterprise and industrial clients.\nSpeaking on his recent appointment as the CEO of Magic Leap, Rosenberg stated:\nI\u2019ve been in the role for about two months now. I was excited to join Magic Leap because of its technology lead, and because of the use cases for customers. Solving real problems for customers has made a lot of progress in that way.\nThe new CEO also explained that Magic Leap is now in its \u201cchapter three\u201d stage, whereby the firm is focusing on the commercial adoption of its XR technology to industry clients and establishing customer use cases.\nMagic Leap to Target Enterprise Use cases\nAlready, leading into 2024, Magic Leap is working with major enterprise end-users, such as Siemens, to leverage what the firm touts as a highly competitive XR display.\nRosenberg appears to remain confident in Magic Leap\u2019s ability to display spatial information for industrial clients better than companies, adding:\nWhen you have the desire to not just display information, and not just even locate information, but to interact with that information at that level of precision, there\u2019s no one else that can do what we do.\nRosenberg also said that sectors such as healthcare, military training, and offices could benefit from XR technology, these examples being \u201cvery high-value use cases\u201d in the eyes of the CEO and his team, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a lot of traction there,\u201d he remarked.\nMoreover, Diez explained that Magic Leap is also \u201clooking at industrial settings,\u201d such as providing immersive training applications for complex on-site procedures \u201cthat require large-scale digital twins and sub-millimetre tracking and overlay of that content.\u201d\nThe firm is ready to leverage a new market. Rosenberg noted that the \u201cmetaverse did a good job of driving curiosity, but many customers have moved beyond that at this point,\u201d indicating a move to adapt the firm\u2019s product base to match evolving auidences.\nIn terms of industry, Diaz notes that the increased usage of the industrial Metaverse term \u2013 whereby firms like AWS and Microsft use the term to describe shared spatial computing applications for enterprise \u2013 could help integrate powerful emerging technologies into the workplace.\nHe said:\nYou throw around terms like \u201cindustrial metaverse,\u201d talking about digital twins of factory floors or specific equipment, those aspects of the metaverse are what customers are most interested in right now. That\u2019s where the value is derived.\nFresh Roadmap for an Enterprise-Focused Future\nMagic Leap is keen to take over the industrial XR device marketplace in 2024; Diez\u00a0also explained that Magic Leap\u2019s roadmap is focused on moving its product portfolio from \u201cPOCs to larger-scale deployments.\u201d\nDiez added:\nAs more and more providers like Siemens, like Cisco jump into this game and provide that halo of having a hardened enterprise solution, combined with the cutting-edge technology, I think that\u2019s definitely the recipe for adoption at scale.\nMoreover, Rosenberg explained that the Magic Leap roadmap will include improvements to its device\u2019s field of view, \u201cimmersiveness,\u201d and mobility to eventually create a product which \u201d feels more like glasses.\u201d\nThe CES 2024 interview comes following Magic Leap securing roughly $590 million via Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, launching the firm\u2019s valuation to more than $4.5 billion and supporting its \u201cchapter 3\u201d roadmap of delivering enterprise-grade XR solutions.\nThe XR marketplace in 2024 is ramping up to be a busy one, with new devices, updates, and promises; time will tell if firms such as Magic Leap, Apple, Meta, and others can keep their heads above the water in the emerging landscape.\nBrands mentioned in this article.\nXR TV\nThe Latest Big XR News: Recap on Highlights from 2023\nAugmented Reality\nApple Vision Pro Competitor Gains Half a Billion in Funding\nAugmented Reality\nLift Off for HoloLens!

        "raw_content": "With $590M in more funding, Magic Leap looks to the future | interview\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nMagic Leap announced in a filing that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund has poured another $590 million in debt funding into the mixed reality headset maker.\nThat is happening just as Apple prepares to go head-to-head with Magic Leap in the mixed-reality goggles market with the February 2 launch of the Apple Vision Pro. I talked to Ross Rosenberg, the new CEO of Magic Leap, and Daniel Diez, CTO, in an interview last week at CES 2024.\nWhile Apple\u2019s device will be tough to compete with, Magic Leap has a slight pricing edge, with a price of $3,300 versus Apple\u2019s $3,500 device. But it is interesting that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is already the majority owner of Magic Leap, wants to double down on the investment. (The investment date was in November). To date, Florida-based Magic Leap has raised $4.5 billion.\nMagic Leap\u2019s founder, Rony Abovitz, stepped down from the CEO job in 2020. Peggy Johnson succeeded him and then she was recently replaced by Rosenberg, a former Bain Capital executive. I spoke with Rosenburg, who talked about the vision for solving customer problems, and Diez, who has been there for some time, answered questions related relating to Magic Leap\u2019s tech and history.\n\u201cWe have these hype cycles, and that\u2019s ridiculous. What\u2019s interesting is the in-between times, when people actually put their heads down and figure out what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Diez said.\nHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.\nDaniel Diez: We\u2019re not on the floor this year. We\u2019re here in these private suites now because we\u2019re moving into more of a go-to-market part of our journey. It\u2019s less about the broad awareness and more about helping customers connect with specific use cases and understanding how they\u2019re using these technologies. That\u2019s what we\u2019re spending our time on here at CES. And of course it\u2019s Ross\u2019s first CES as CEO of Magic Leap, so it\u2019s been good for him to see our customers and our partners.\nRoss Rosenberg: It\u2019s been a great opportunity to see all the progress being made in XR and our pioneer status in that. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here.\nVentureBeat: Is anything changing in the time you\u2019ve been in charge now?\nRosenberg: I\u2019ve been in the role for about two months now. I was excited to join Magic Leap because of its technology lead, and because of the use cases for customers. Solving real problems for customers has made a lot of progress in that way. That\u2019s what brought me here. We\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the third chapter in Magic Leap\u2019s history. Chapter one was about invention and the breakthroughs that were created under Rony. Chapter two was about productizing those inventions. We now have Magic Leap Two. Chapter three is about commercial adoption of that technology, which goes to customer use cases. It goes to applications. It goes to content and all the things we can help the industry coalesce around an ecosystem.\nVentureBeat: Is there any one product category or industry category that\u2019s doing the best for you?\nRosenberg: The way we think about it, the use cases where you can do the kind of collaboration and interaction with digital information, and in a way where there\u2019s simply no substitute from a 2D device. An example of that would be in health care for surgery, complex surgical planning, whether it\u2019s brain or spinal surgery. The surgical preparation, and even the surgery itself that needs to happen. There\u2019s simply no way to do that level of planning and get the accuracy ahead of time without doing it in a collaborative and spatial way. Same thing in the military space. We think of those as very high value use cases for this device. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction there.\nDiez: We\u2019re looking at industrial settings, training for complex procedures that require large scale digital twins and sub-millimeter tracking and overlay of that content. That\u2019s another area where optical see-through, and specifically Magic Leap\u2019s technology, serves a portion of the market that can\u2019t be served by any competitive spatial computing.\nVentureBeat: Sub-millimeter, is that a good way to convey how precise it is? What does that refer to?\nDiez: The digital overlay, when you want to overlay content and have it stick over the physical object, that\u2019s where you are. If you want to be able to modify that\u2013a great example is this company called Medical Eyesight. They\u2019re out of the U.K., and they\u2019ve been regulatory approved for surgery. They do mechanical thrombectomy, physically removing blood clots from the brain. That\u2019s faster than waiting for medication to do it, and the faster you do it, the less likely you are to have extensive brain damage and lose function.\nThey\u2019ve been able to do that now through guidance with Magic Leap. The vessels they\u2019re in with the catheter are re-created in front of them, and they\u2019re able to guide through the human body with that 3D model. Because it\u2019s so precise, they\u2019re now able to reach areas of the brain that were impossible to reach with the previous methodology of using a 2D screen for guidance. That level of accuracy is enabling these use cases that require high precision. They\u2019re having a major impact on patient outcomes.\nVentureBeat: How do you feel about your defensible space relative to Apple coming in?\nRosenberg: When you have the desire to not just display information, and not just even locate information, but to interact with that information at that level of precision, there\u2019s no one else that can do what we do. There\u2019s a big moat around the company for those types of use cases. What Apple has shown, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, is much more about watching a streaming movie or a Facetime call, where you don\u2019t need nearly as much accuracy. That\u2019s a very different space.\nDiez: The other big difference is that if the task you\u2019re doing requires you to be in motion as the user, or if things in your environment are in motion, the lag of re-rendering every time an object moves or you move and putting it on the screens is a deal killer for something like military training applications, police, first responders, active shooter training, or physicians who want to see things immediately. We\u2019ve carved out a defensible position in that this is one of the few headsets, maybe one of one sometimes, that can do what Magic Leap does.\nVentureBeat: Has the price stayed the same, or have you reacted in some way to where Apple is at?\nDiez: The pricing has remained consistent since we launched.\nRosenberg: We\u2019ll look at it through the lens of the customer and the value we deliver. In some of these very high value use cases, either because the device has been certified for medical use, or because it\u2019s delivering so much incremental value for our partners, the pricing that a consumer might evaluate is somewhat irrelevant to the way people think about the ROI from this technology.\nVentureBeat: Are the digital twin installations turning out to be good for the company as well? Siemens had a very big keynote here on the industrial metaverse. Is that something you\u2019re part of?\nDiez: Siemens is a good partner. We\u2019re working with a number of clients using their digital twins with different use cases. It\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re doing and where we deliver value.\nVentureBeat: Is that potentially something where you have a chance to sell in thousands of products, one of the big efforts or big companies?\nDiez: That\u2019s the road map, moving this from POCs to larger-scale deployments. As more and more providers like Siemens, like Cisco jump into this game and provide that halo of having a hardened enterprise solution, combined with the cutting-edge technology, I think that\u2019s definitely the recipe for adoption at scale.\nVentureBeat: What is the road map for where you go from here?\nRosenberg: We have a road map based on expanding the technology we have. Expanding the field of view, expanding the immersiveness, making the device more mobile in some ways, less tethered. All of those things are on our road map. As you extend beyond that time period, you think about ways to further reduce the size and weight of the device. Eventually you get to something that feels more like glasses. We think about all those things as we design our road map.\nVentureBeat: Do you use Qualcomm chips, or something else?\nDiez: Right now the chip is AMD. The compute power necessary for this device is large. You\u2019re looking at a Macbook Pro level of computing. That requires the semi-custom chip that we designed with AMD. It\u2019s very powerful. Something lighter weight, maybe meant more for a mobile device, would not be able to do what we need this to do.\nVentureBeat: With semiconductor strategies, sometimes I think companies will opt for a platform that somebody else can invest in more, and then you get the benefit of that. As opposed to having to do the work of custom design. Even working with another party, as in this case, if some other entity can do some of the work\u2013that\u2019s always Intel\u2019s pitch. \u201cWe\u2019ll take this off your hands.\u201d\nDiez: At the time, when this was in development, the partnership with AMD was critical, their ability to design with us and meet specific requirements. The chip that they\u2019ve created is semi-custom. It\u2019s available to the market. It\u2019s not completely exclusive to Magic Leap. AMD\u2019s bet is that they want to continue to develop these chips so they can supply this market. As the market progresses, you\u2019ll absolutely see more chip manufacturers begin to develop chips that will have this level of compute, and they\u2019ll try to truly compete for what will be a very large hardware market for AR and spatial computing.\nVentureBeat: At that point, is there some other value that you\u2019ll focus on?\nRosenberg: There\u2019s a few things. The optics technology we have that allows the immersive experience, no one else in the world has it. The broad field of view, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger as we execute our road map, is something only we can do. We don\u2019t necessarily think of that as distinct today from the level of compute that\u2019s necessary, because we also have software that allows you to perceive the world. It allows digital information to stick to the real world as you see it. That\u2019s very important. As other people get better at that, although they haven\u2019t yet, then it could allow you to step back if you wanted to. But today\u2013our customers require us to do all of that.\nDiez: As more componentry becomes available and it gets more advanced, Magic Leap will be very happy not to have to custom create things ourselves. Where we would focus our time is where the majority of our IP and value lies, which is in this optical stack. That\u2019s next to impossible to re-create.\nVentureBeat: Are advances in AI bringing something new to the table for you?\nRosenberg: There\u2019s a history of AI in the device itself, just to recognize what\u2019s in a room with you. We\u2019re moving the ball forward pretty significantly, because if you think about an AI model, a generative model, being able to light a certain area of the room and recognize everything that\u2019s there, that\u2019s a rich source of data that we provide. At the same time, all the behavior change that\u2019s occurred with generative AI\u2013people want their output first in text, second in images, third in 2D video, and eventually they\u2019ll need that same output to the same questions in a spatial way.\nVentureBeat: How many people does Magic Leap have now? Has that fluctuated much?\nDiez: We\u2019re over 1,000. We\u2019re probably over 1,100 at this moment in time? I don\u2019t think that has fluctuated for a bit of time. We have a number of positions open right now. We\u2019re definitely growing the team as necessary.\nVentureBeat: \u201cMetaverse\u201d isn\u2019t as popular a word today as it was for a while. What\u2019s your perspective on that?\nRosenberg: Customers have become much more sophisticated. They can be much more discerning. They don\u2019t necessarily need those kinds of broad-based terms. Again, am I going to display the information? Am I going to locate it? Am I going to interact with it? They really want to know what kind of spatial 3D experience they can have. How does it integrate with data that sits inside my company? They end up being very specific and precise business process and workflow kinds of questions. Metaverse did a good job of driving curiosity, but many customers have moved beyond that at this point.\nDiez: The way it was defined early on, it also became incredibly narrow. Because it was one company leading the conversation at the time, it became very much about artificial digital environments that remove you from the physical world. It became much more of a VR conversation. People were fascinated by that, which is great. Any interest in spatial computing is a great thing. But it became too narrow a view of what the metaverse is.\nIt\u2019s pretty commonly accepted or agreed upon that the true capabilities of the metaverse will come to life when it\u2019s a fabric built of digital experiences ingrained or embedded into the physical world. That\u2019s where the metaverse becomes really interesting. You throw around terms like \u201cindustrial metaverse,\u201d talking about digital twins of factory floors or specific equipment, those aspects of the metaverse are what customers are most interested in right now. That\u2019s where the value is derived. But if we do this right, the metaverse will be not about this idea of world escapism and going into digital environments. It\u2019ll be the thing that enables us to be even more fully immersed in the physical world, doing things that we weren\u2019t capable of doing before.\nRosenberg: Most of the customers we talk to are trying to get something done. They\u2019re trying to repair something, train someone, design something. Those are the words they use. They don\u2019t start with, \u201cHey, tell me about your metaverse.\u201d\nDiez: It\u2019s a backbone thing that they don\u2019t really talk about anymore. It\u2019s just understood that there are aspects to what we think the metaverse is that they know are necessary for their applications.\nVentureBeat: It\u2019s an interesting side business for Sony to come up with their own headset now, to design metaverse experiences. It doesn\u2019t seem like their core business.\nDiez: PlayStation VR is doing well for them, I think. It\u2019s an interesting area to explore. VR and passthrough is an ideal technology for gaming and entertainment purposes. It feels appropriate for them. I can see why they\u2019re exploring that. We\u2019ll see where they go next.\nWe have these hype cycles, and that\u2019s ridiculous. What\u2019s interesting is the in-between times, when people actually put their heads down and figure out what they\u2019re going to do. Inevitably that leads to another hype cycle and people get disappointed again, because it doesn\u2019t do what they want to, but then you go back and do the work again.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nMagic Leap jumps from office collaboration to smart cities\nSee als\nIn theory, virtual reality is agnostic when it comes to whether it is experienced indoors or outdoors. Since it completely overlays the real world surroundings, the external environment makes little difference. In augmented reality, however, the external environment is not only significant but has been a defining characteristic up to this point. \"Smart glasses\" dating back to Google Glass have focused on relaying bite-sized environmental cues from nearly anywhere. They sacrifice graphical richness for ubiquity. In contrast. AR headsets such as the HoloLens provide rich overlays within a relatively confined space, throwing significantly more processing power at creating their digital objects. Nonetheless, both sets of products today primarily target enterprise tasks such as training.\nBetween the two approaches. Magic Leap is far closer to the latter, as I experienced when I tried it at an AT&T store back in April. But the company brought a broader set of experiences to AT&T's Shape event. There, it offered a peek at a future of digital magic against a backdrop of today's movie magic: the storied Warner Brothers studio lot. In addition to its Game of Thrones experience, the mixed reality company provided demos of a fun shooting game starring killer robots lurking beyond and emerging from the wall. (Note to realtors: Be sure to check out homes with augmented reality tech to find all portals to other dimensions.)\nIts other demos were far more business-related. The most impressive was a collaborative interaction with \"Mica,\" an AI-driven agent who effectively guided me to pick up objects around the room and create a collage on a wall from cut-out shapes placed on a table. Magic Leap apologetically forewarned that Mica was silent at this stage of her development, but in some ways that added to the fun mystery of interacting with her. The last demo was a nearly perfect complement to Mica: a telepresence demo with a digital representation of an actual human with whom I could not only converse but collaboratively manipulate digital objects. While she was crudely rendered, Magic Leap noted that the technology is emerging and hails from Mimesys, a company it recently acquired.\nSpecial feature\nVR and AR: The Business Reality\nVirtual Reality and Augmented Reality are going to be useful for far more than just gaming. We explore the ways the technology will be used for training, marketing, product design, and much more.\nThe novel productivity collaboration apps served as a reality check against the grand ambition that Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz articulated. Unlike many of today's marketplace entrants, Magic Leap is not shy about charting a course to a future where entire cities are blanketed in a digital reality that sits atop our physical one. This future could enable everything from avatars walking alongside us in the street like astrally projected Jedi to skyscraper-sized digital dinosaurs serving as targets for massive multiplayer battles.\nThis vision represents a great reconciliation of the two approaches to augmented reality, enabling rich holograms freed from the barriers of rooms. It also crystallizes the often amorphous IoT-reliant concept of smart cities, where examples include such workaday functionality as better air quality and traffic monitoring and smart garbage cans that can notify sanitation crews when they are overflowing. Indeed, particularly when it comes to cash-starved municipalities, the better option for creating an environment filled with information-rich objects may be to digitally augment them rather than replace them.\nTo be sure, we are a long way from such a vision, one that may suffer from the same kind of persistent battle for our attention that smartphones provide or worse. For now, Magic Leap recognizes that the current iteration of its gear is too conspicuous and expensive for everyday use, a challenge that traces back to the Glass backlash. But it eagerly offers that we won't be waiting long for the next generation that will drive down the price and size of its hardware -- the next step in a leap that will require a lot more science than magic.\nDisclosure: The demos and presentation referenced in this article took place at AT&T Shape, an event for which AT&T paid travel expenses.

        "raw_content": "After struggling with consumers, Magic Leap hang its hopes on enterprise\nSomething wasn\u2019t working. In late 2020, Magic Leap announced a major change spearheaded by incoming CEO, Peggy Johnson. \u201c[W]hat I found was nothing was really broken,\u201d she told the press at the time, \u201cIt just needed to have a bit more focus.\u201d\nFrom the outside, certainly, it seemed like typically understated chief executive speak. It doesn\u2019t take a business genius to point out that things weren\u2019t working. It wasn\u2019t a reflection on the technology, certainly. Those who\u2019ve managed to try Magic Leap\u2019s mixed reality headsets have been impressed. I spent time with the product at CES this week, and it certainly feels like the future.\nBut the company ran afoul of an issue that plagued countless others in this category \u2014 the consumer audience for a $2,300 mixed-reality headset simply wasn\u2019t there. So it did what any extremely well-funded but struggling company does. Magic Leap pivoted. It suddenly found itself in the business of business, chasing the same enterprise audience that lured in Microsoft and Epson.\nThe pivot was very much on display on the show floor this week. The demos weren\u2019t games; they were the output of developers looking toward profoundly serious use cases. In one, a 3D scan of the human brain emerges, pointing the way toward use in medical settings. In another, a mountain pops up. In the foreground, a wildfire advances. Tiny helicopters circle around in the air above.\nCTO Daniel Diez tells TechCrunch that the shift in focus began in earnest at the tail end of 2019. The timing was certainly fortuitous, as the prolonged financial slowdown of the past three years have made a $1,000+ item of luxury technology even more unattainable for the average consumer.\n\u201cWe really saw that there was a value to be derived from AR much sooner from enterprise,\u201d Diez explains. \u201cThe feedback we were getting from them was that. It also gave us insight into how the product needed to evolve to be truly purpose-built for enterprise, and that\u2019s what you see in the Magic Leap 2.\u201d\nWhile others, like Meta and HTC, are doing their best to be all things to all people in terms of content, Magic Leap appears to be in no specific rush to get their systems into the hands of more consumers \u2014 or at least not to make the sorts of sacrifices to the hardware required in order to get there.\n\u201cWe see an immediate opportunity in enterprise,\u201d says CTO, Julie Larson-Green. \u201cI think on consumer, you kind of have to have some other consumer content business alongside that, really. So we\u2019re not really focused on that side right now.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, the company has made more headlines for its fundraising than any specific piece of content or hardware. At the tail end of the year, Saudi Arabia snagged a controlling stake through its public investment firm. The new influx of funds joined nearly $3.5 billion previously raised by the company with help from Google, Alibaba and Qualcomm, among others. Magic Leap\u2019s public struggles, coupled with massive fundraising, have created some open-ended questions about the firm\u2019s future.\nAsked whether recent funding will have a direct impact on Magic Leap\u2019s future roadmap, Diez says, \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have a very supportive investor base. They are very much in line with our vision of really focusing on enterprise and making sure the devices can amplify the ability of folks to do really complicated things. Our board and our financiers are all on the same page.\u201d"

Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Everything We Expect to See at CES 2024\nCES 2024 is nearly upon us. I'll be attending this year for the first time, and I'm getting ready to be inundated with more tech news than I can handle. If you're interested in following along, but aren't sure what the Consumer Electronics Show is all about, here's what to expect.\nWhen is CES 2024?\nThis year, CES will run Tuesday, Jan. 9 through Friday, Jan. 12. However, there are media events happening before the official start of the conference, running both Sunday the 7th and Monday the 8th.\nAs usual, the conference takes place in Las Vegas, NV, and is spread out over a variety of locations. Pre-show media events take place at Mandalay Bay, while the main press conferences are held at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) and Venetian Expo. But there are also plenty of events happening all over the strip, depending on the brand.\nRest assured: If you're tuned into the tech world, you're going to see a lot of tech news next week.\nWhich brands are attending CES?\nA lot of them.\nCES is a massive conference, complete with companies you know, as well as many you don't. In recent years, it's become a welcome place for start ups to show off their upcoming products and services.\nCES' Featured Exhibitors page highlights 25 brands that will no doubt make big announcements during the conference, including:\nAARP\nAbbott\nAccenture\nAMG (Allen Media Group)\nAmazon\nCaterpillar\nCharter Communications\nGoogle\nHyundai\nIBM\nIndy Autonomous Challenge\nIntel\nJohn Deere\nKia\nLenovo\nLG\nL'Or\u00e9al\nNBCUniversal\nMercedes-Benz\nPanasonic\nReddit\nRoku\nSamsung\nSony\nQualcomm\nBut that's only 25 names out of 4,274, at least according to the CES exhibitor directory. You can sort this list by category to get a better idea of how many companies are repping which type of tech. For example, there are 878 results for companies related to artificial intelligence, but only 30 related to NFTs. (Unrelated: Does anyone want to buy a Bored Ape?)\nWhat to expect from CES 2024\nCompanies don't tend to make many major announcements before the conference actually starts. (After all, why bother holding space at CES if you're going to spill the beans ahead of time?) But in addition to the few announcements we do have, there are a lot of trends in tech right now that will likely manifest as devices, upgrades, and services from the thousands of brands appearing at the conference. Here's a preview of what to look out for:\nAI\nAI was the tech story of 2023, and so it will continue into 2024. While ChatGPT was less than two months old at last year's CES, companies have been working feverishly to either develop their own LLMs, or incorporate existing LLMs into their platforms.\nAs noted above, there are almost 900 companies associated with artificial intelligence attending the conference, so expect to see a lot of generative AI-powered products and services this year. But you may also see companies like Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA pushing NPUs (neural processing units), hardware specifically designed to process AI computing. These companies are already talking about the \"AI PC,\" and it's likely those developments will continue on with CES. In fact, Intel is holding an event on Jan. 8 with Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft to discuss AI PCs.\nTVs\nCES and TVs go hand-in-hand. Last year, LG unveiled its OLED M TV, an entirely wireless display that beams all of its content from an external receiver. Samsung showed off its 76-inch MicroLED TV, which it called the \"world's smallest and most affordable MicroLED screen,\" at the time.\nTV maker Displace has already announced what they're showing off: the 27-inch Displace Mini and 55-inch Displace Flex. These TVs are able to run off battery power for a month (assuming you use it for six hours a day), and the Flex supports an optional wireless charging mount.\nAgain, AI is going to be a player here. LG actually announced its 2024 TV lineup ahead of CES, which utilize AI upscaling to sharpen the content on-screen, and sport up to 144Hz refresh rates. And, as Mashable as highlighted, we're expecting to see foldable TVs, wireless TVs that are easier to mount, and TVs that reach as much as 10,000 nits of brightness.\nAR/VR\nOnce a niche in the tech sphere, AR/VR is finally starting to make it big. Apple got everyone's attention with the announcement of Vision Pro, while Meta's Quest 3 offers Apple's best features in a much cheaper package\u2014not to mention, it's actually available to purchase.\nAccording to CES' exhibitor directory, there are 345 companies associated with AR/VR, from Hisense, to Magic Leap, to Panasonic. Expect some new headsets and strategies from this space.\nSmart home tech\nSmart home tech has never been as varied and accessible as it is now. Of course, that's not going to slow companies down. Just look at LG: The company issued a press release late last year announcing its smart home AI agent, a little robot that acts as a \"moving smart home hub.\" LG will be showing off this unique smart home friend at CES, so we'll see more about how this robot analyzes both your home (and you) at all times to change smart devices accordingly.\nThere are countless smart home tech companies out there, and many of them will be at CES. We'll see what they plan to bring to the table.\nCars\nWe don't cover automobiles much on Lifehacker, but they'll be at CES. Expect to see announcements from from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Kia, and Hyundai. However, following the autoworker strikes last year, US car companies like GM, Ford, and Stellantis will not attend the conference.\nJake Peterson is Lifehacker\u2019s Senior Technology Editor.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Magic Leap 2 Gains Certification so Doctors Can Use AR During Surgery\nMagic Leap, the storied unicorn developing enterprise AR headsets, announced at CES 2023 that its flagship device Magic Leap 2 earned a certification that clears it for use in the operating room.\nThe company first intimated it had pursued IEC 60601-1 certification at SPIE\u2019s XR conference in January 2022, however the news largely went unreported since the information was presented in\u00a0a single slide at the conference.\nAt AMD\u2019s CES 2023 keynote, Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson confirmed Magic Leap 2 has indeed obtained\u00a0IEC 60601-1 certification for its flagship AR headset.\nAs explained by T\u00dcV Rheinland, the\u00a0IEC 60601-1 certification specifies a device that is \u201cintended to diagnose, treat, or monitor a patient under medical supervision and, which makes physical or electrical contact with the patient and/or transfers energy to or from the patient and/or detects such an energy transfer to or from the patient.\u201d\nMagic Leap says this certification allows Magic Leap 2 to be used both in an operating room as well as in other clinical settings, allowing medical professionals such as surgeons to focus on the patient and not have to refer to 2D screens.\nBy and large, this gives software developers a non-inconsequential inroad into gaining FDA certification for apps that could be used during surgery, and not just for pre-surgical training.\nOne such Magic Leap partner, SentiAR, is currently\u00a0under review by the FDA for its app which connects physicians to live clinical data and images, allowing them to do operations such as navigating a catheter through blood vessels of the heart using a 3D map of a patient\u2019s heart and the location of the catheter in real time.\nFounded in 2010, the Plantation, Florida-based company initially exited the gate with consumer ambitions for its first AR headset, Magic Leap 1 (previously styled \u2018One\u2019). After awkwardly straddling the segment with its $2,300 AR headset, the company made a decisive pivot in mid-2020 when co-founder Rony Abovitz announced he would be\u00a0stepping down as CEO, positioning the company to reprioritize its future devices away from consumers. It has since released Magic Leap 2, which is largely targeted at enterprise.\nThe well-funded company, which has amassed $4 billion in funds to date, has recently taken on $450 million from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, giving the country a majority share in the US-based augmented reality company.\nThis article may contain affiliate links.

But in the near future of tye glasses can be really clear like normal glasses, I certainly think this is the way forward, especially with realtime overlays and information.

        "raw_content": "What\u2019s Next for Magic Leap\nI look back on 2022 with a level of amazement at what we\u2019ve accomplished at Magic Leap. Our team dedicated countless hours to bringing the market's most advanced augmented reality technology to our customers, which culminated in the launch of Magic Leap 2. While that in and of itself is exciting, there is so much going on in our company and industry that has me energized going into next year.\nMagic Leap is a very different company today than when I joined two years ago, and the transformation we\u2019ve accomplished is a testament to our talent and unique culture. We truly stand alone in our industry; unlike many other companies in this space, we are oriented toward a single goal: creating the best platform that makes augmented reality a useful and powerful tool for business.\nMagic Leap 2 is the result of our singular focus. It\u2019s a platform that truly addresses the historical barriers that have long held back adoption of Augmented Reality (AR). We invented optics technology that creates a one-of-a-kind viewing experience, have engineered a form factor to comfortably fit many unique head shapes, and made it the lightest and most powerful enterprise AR headset on the market. The industry recognized these efforts and throughout the year bestowed a number of awards on Magic Leap 2 for its innovative design, including an iF Gold Award\u00a0and a\u00a0Red Dot Design Best of the Best of 2022 Award. And most recently, Time Magazine featured Magic Leap 2 as one of\u00a0The Best Inventions of 2022.\nBut we aren\u2019t satisfied yet and remain focused on improving what makes Magic Leap 2 an industry leading device. We are working with a diverse range of customers to understand where and how AR can create greater value in their businesses. That includes helping a manufacturer, PBC Linear, make gains in the productivity and retention of new hires, Brainlab\u2019s use of AR in surgical planning to enable better patient outcomes in the operating room, and giving Lowe\u2019s retail store associates better insights for managing inventory and product displays.\nWe have also received an incredible amount of interest from across the industry to license our IP and utilize our patented manufacturing process to produce optics for others seeking to launch their own mixed-reality technology. The fact that companies are asking us to do this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. It highlights just how hard it is to develop and manufacture AR hardware - and that our years of experience have provided us with a competitive advantage in this market.\nAs we move into 2023, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the state of the industry and where we see opportunity going forward.\nState of the Industry: Augmented and Virtual Reality\nIn the last year, we have seen renewed excitement with mixed reality technologies. The conversation around the possibilities of the metaverse and new product announcements is exciting and strong evidence of the health of the industry.\nAt Magic Leap, we believe that the metaverse is already here, with many currently experiencing a limited view via phones, computers, and tablets. Our goal is to make our interactions with the metaverse a more natural extension of how we view and operate in the physical world.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot of comparisons of AR and virtual reality as major technology companies talk about their vision of the metaverse, but it\u2019s important to note that these are not interchangeable. AR is a very different technology from VR and even passthrough VR, and it has different applications.\nVirtual reality is about building avatars, escaping the physical world, and immersing yourself in artificial worlds. VR may have immediate benefits for gaming and entertainment, but in an enterprise environment, you need to be present in the physical world. No surgeon would operate using VR headset that occludes their view of the patient in front of them and no one working in an industrial setting would put themselves at risk by using a headset that doesn\u2019t allow them to see what\u2019s going around them in real-time.\nBusinesses don\u2019t have the luxury of escaping to virtual worlds. Businesses live in the real world and the truth is, the technology that delivers the most value for business today is AR.\nWhat\u2019s Next for Magic Leap\nThere\u2019s a lot to look forward to in the coming year as the growth of our company and industry accelerates. We\u2019re seeing increasing demand for AR solutions today, and we\u2019re working closely with developers to create new opportunities with AR. We are also growing our team with engineering, software, and product talent that will help us to continue to be the leader in AR technology.\nThe best way to understand AR is to experience it, which is why I\u2019m looking forward to starting 2023 at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. In our two story booth located in Tech East, LVCC Central, Booth #15875, we will be showcasing many of the latest AR solutions on Magic Leap 2 including BrainLab, Manifest by Taqtile, Cisco Webex Hologram, and NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse. We will also be debuting Magic Leap Assist, our remote assistance reference application.\nIn January, we will also be attending the World Economic Forum, where Magic Leap is once again being positioned as a thought leader in AR technology.\u00a0 I will be speaking on multiple panels focused on the metaverse and advanced manufacturing and we will be demonstrating Magic Leap 2 to global leaders in business and government.\nMagic Leap is well-positioned to lead the market and power our industry forward. We have put in place the right strategy working closely with enterprise customers and developers. We have an extensive IP portfolio backing the most advanced AR device on the market and business momentum is strong heading into 2023.\nI can\u2019t wait to show you what\u2019s next for Magic Leap over the coming year.\nLatest Content\nNew Features on Magic Leap 2 Empower Developers and Enhance Enterprise AR Solutions\nMagic Leap Appoints Ross Rosenberg as Chief Executive Officer\nSentiAR Announces Second FDA Clearance for CommandEP Interface Utilizing Magic Leap 2 Platform\nMagic Leap Announces Magic Leap 2 is TAA compliant"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Magic Leap 1 AR Headsets Will Self-Terminate in December 2024\nThose who dropped $2,300 on the infamous Magic Leap 1 have a little over a year to say goodbye. The Florida-based augmented reality (AR) company is warning that its first headset will stop working on Dec. 31, 2024. It follows that troubleshooting assistance will also become unavailable on that date, though Magic Leap will continue to honor warranty claims involving the device\u2019s original warranty.\nMagic Leap shared the news in an email to customers last week. \u201cWe are announcing that Magic Leap 1 end of life date will be Dec. 31, 2024,\u201d the message read. Magic Leap said that operating system updates would only fix core functionality issues through that date; users would be on their own after that.\nSteve Lukas, a former senior manager at Magic Leap, shared his thoughts via X (formerly Twitter) Wednesday. Lukas said the Leap 1 performs a hard-coded cloud security check every six months. Without a working cloud service to check against, the device won\u2019t work.\nThe Leap 1 hasn\u2019t been available for purchase for quite some time, and for good reason. The slim AR headset hit shelves in only six US cities in August 2018 and was immediately met with skepticism from AR enthusiasts, Silicon Valley founders, repair experts, and also us. A lack of replaceable battery and gluey assembly, as confirmed by iFixit, justified consumers\u2019 worries that the Leap 1 was overpriced and doomed to fail. \u201cThe Leap 1 is clearly an expensive, short-run piece of hardware,\u201d iFixit said just a few weeks after the device\u2019s release. \u201cEvery bit of construction is intended to maintain the precise calibration for the life of the device. We would guess that this was pushed out at full speed, damn the price, just to get something on the market.\u201d\nAnd fail it did. Magic Leap sold 6,000 units in the six months following its flagship\u2019s launch, but sales dropped off after that. (For comparison\u2019s sake, Microsoft sold about 50,000 HoloLens units within two years of launch.) This led the company to assign its patents to JP Morgan Chase as collateral in a last-ditch effort to stay in business.\nLess than two years after the Leap 1\u2019s debut, Magic Leap started looking at acquisition. It recovered after that, eventually releasing the even pricier Leap 2 in 2022. The Leap 2 is said to be a vast improvement over its predecessor, but it\u2019s an enterprise device. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing\u2014in fact, the Leap 2 outperforms Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens 2 in many ways\u2014but with the Leap 1\u2019s death imminent, it seems Magic Leap is better off ditching consumer tech altogether.\nTagged In\nMore from Consumer Electronics\nExtremeTech supports Group Black and its mission to increase greater diversity in media voices and media ownerships.\n\u00a9 2001-2024 Ziff Davis, LLC., a Ziff Davis company.
