This revolutionary earbuds is perhaps by far the most comprehensive one in the open-ear earbuds market, taking both work and life into consideration with its unquine detachable microphone design that allows users to switch between different scenarios.\nComfortable Open-Ear Design\nWith the unobtrusive open-ear design, a lightweight of 8.5 gram per earbud and the skin-friendly coating, the EMEET AirFlow gives users a gently light touch on ears for optimized comfort. The ergonomic design of the\u00a0earhook that has been tested for over 2560 types of ear shapes offers a comfortable and secure fit, with a pair of stabilizer fins to better fit with various shapes.\nThe Standout Detachable Microphone\nWhat makes the EMEET AirFlow stand out in the open-ear earbuds market lies exactly on its characteristic detachable microphone that can be plugged into both sides of the earbuds, which tremendously improve the voice pickup effect during voice calls. With EMEET's exclusive VoiceCore noise cancellation algorithm that enables dual-channel noise cancellation up to 50dB, it provides distraction-free online conversation experience\u00a0 even in noisy environments such as open offices or on the road.\nSomething Special in the Case\nAn intriguing feature of the EMEET AirFlow doesn't lie in the earbuds themselves but in the charging case. With UV light within the case, it enables 99.9% sterilization of commonly seen bacteria like colibacillus and staphylococcus aureus breed on the earbuds, refreshing every wearing experience and caring for your ear health.\nPowerful Bass Performance\nThough EMEET AirFlow focuses more on callling experience, when it comes to the audio performance for listening to music, it still delivers an exceptional performance thanks to the EMEET exclusive HyperBass bass boost algorithm and a 16.2mm dynamic driver.\nIn Conclusion\nThe EMEET AirFlow\u00a0is bound to make some waves in the open-ear earbuds market with such competitive features and an unbeatable price. Besides, EMEET is also going to showcase their wireless live streaming cameras, the EMEET StreamCam One and the EMEET Meeting Capsule series for hybrid collaborations at CES 2024. If this is something you'd like to get hands on, remember to visit EMEET at booth #22836 from Jan.9th to 12th at LVCC, central hall.

In recent years, a webcam and communication accessories revolution has occurred, and it only gets better by the day. Working from home also necessitated and showed people how important webcams could be for those who work from home or have virtual meetings away from their offices. This was made even worse with the COVID-19 pandemic and forced shutdowns across the globe, and most people were forced to work from where they were. Many industries were affected since face-to-face meetings and working in such environments were prohibited because of fear of the spread of the virus.\nDue to this, the demand for webcams and not only webcams but good communication types of equipment that were clear were highly sorted after. Several companies have always put their best foot ahead in the game of producing the best webcams and pieces of equipment that were needed by those working from home. One of the companies or manufacturers that are involved in the production of such accessories is EMEET.\nThe company is well renowned all over the world for the production of communication equipment, and the webcam is one of them.

In addition to that, it is very easy to install and easy to operate with any system.\nEMEET C960 1080P Webcam with Microphone\nAnother product that must be mentioned is the EMEET C960 1080P Webcam with Microphone, which is at the top of the Amazon Webcam Mounts Best Selling Ranking. The webcam has the biggest selling point of having a fixed focal length between 1.97-197 inches, guaranteeing the production of clear images. A user's privacy is also guaranteed with this camera, as it comes with a privacy cover. Microphones inbuilt come with a camera, saving the need to buy a microphone separately. The microphones can automatically detect and filter out noises in the background, ensuring high-quality audio. The company had in mind those working in not well-lit environments as the camera has automatic light correction installed, ensuring high-quality videos even in such circumstances.

If \"AI\" is one of the keywords in the field of technology this year, then \"open-ear\" is the one when it comes to headphones. EMEET AirFlow Wireless Open-Ear Design Earbuds\nOpen-ear earbuds \u00a0have gained significant traction in the market with numerous companies launching various types recently. These innovative earbuds have taken the audio industry by storm, providing a unique listening experience that allows users to stay connected to the environment around them while still enjoying high-quality sound. While most of them focus on comfort and sound quality, there seems to be a vacancy in the market, a balancing combination of exceptional sound quality and also a professional call experience. That's why the EMEET AirFlow comes into stage during CES 2024. Comfortable Fit\nWith over 2560 types of ear shapes tested, The EMEET AirFlow offers a cmofortable fit for various kinds of ears with the ergonomic earhook design and a skin-friendly coating. Besides, its 8.5 gram lightweight per earbud gives users an insensible touch without obtrusive feelings on ears. Apart from the structural design, EMEET also provides a pair of stabilizer fins, which can be attached to the earbuds and offers an even more secure fit for ears of different shapes and sizes. The Unique Detachable Mic Boom\nThe EMEET AirFlow's detachable microphone boom is a game-changing feature that provides crystal clear sound for professional calls. This unique design gives users flexibility to wear this pair of earbuds for varying preferences. With EMEET's exclusive VoiceCore noise cancelling algorithm that enables dual-channel noise cancellation, EMEET AirFlow can cancel out both the close-end noise when you speak and the far-end noise when the other side of the call speaks, providing mutual benefits for both sides during calls. A Different Way for Your Hearing Care\nAnother feature that is worth mentioning of the EMEET AirFlow lies not in the earbuds but in the charging case. Featuring a UV light around the charging contact area, the charging case is able to sterilize commonly seen bacteria breed on the earbuds like colibacillus and staphylococcus aureus to an extent of 99.99%. Of course, EMEET also integrates a hearing protection reminder in the app EMEET TUNE, caring for your hearing in multiple ways. Powerful Bass Performance\nThough EMEET AirFlow focuses more on callling experience, when it comes to the audio performance for listening to music, it still delivers an exceptional performance thanks to the EMEET exclusive HyperBass bass boost algorithm and a 16.2mm dynamic driver. In Conclusion\nBesides the above-mentioned features, EMEET AirFlow also offers an 8-hour play time per fully charged and a 40-hour play time with the charging case for long time usage.

This camera has an internal battery which is awesome! you can also record offline to a micro SD card as well. One of the key features of this camera is the ability to wirelessly link up to 3 of these for seamless scene switching. Something else that's pretty awesome is it comes with a hard case for travel and storage. You can mount this to a tripod or a gymbal making the applications of this camera limitless. This is a great camera and I'd happily recommend it to anyone.\nI work from home and occasionally my family and/or dogs are loud. I needed noise cancelling headphones, the others I've had either don't cancel out background noise or aren't comfortable. My son was standing next to me loudly asking for dad and my husband couldn't hear him or could barely when I was quiet. They are lightweight although they look bulky. Make sure to read your instructions, I went rogue and was confused at first about how to charge them. I set them up via Bluetooth to my cellphone and was good to go.\nI was overall really impressed with these headphones - they\nare very comfortable and work great for work meetings and listening to music.\nSize and Comfort: I have a pretty big head so sometimes I experience discomfort when wearing these types of headphones with them pressing against my head - however these headphones are pretty comfortable and I can barely feel anything pressing against my head. The headphones are pretty adjustable with the top part of it being pretty stretchy/adjustable and has a really nice soft feel.\nConnectivity: It took a while for me to get it to connect via Bluetooth compared to other headphones, but once I plugged in the USB into my computer it connected right away. I LOVE how I was able to have it connect to multiple devices - I had it connect to both my computer and phone so its AMAZING for multi-tasking which I always do. I love having the option to plug it in with a wire or have it wireless.\nSound quality: I was quite impressed with the sound quality and it sounds just the same as if I were using a $200-300 pair of headphones and I was able to block out outside sounds while wearing it and no one was able to hear the sounds from my headphones either. Amazing!\nMicrophone: The microphone seems to work really well - people said they were able to hear me very clearly! It also gives the professional vibe when using it for a work call.\nBattery: The battery seems to last at least a few work days for the full day. Excellent!\nThis thing has been a solid performer so far. The sound from it is loud and people on the other end report that the mic pickup comes through clear and crisp.\nThis conference speaker is excellent.\nIt reduces feedback from multiple phones in a room on the same call when in the past the phones echo when they are too close.\nYou can add several people easily on a call.\nThe speaker is crystal clear.\nMy husband and I have even been using the speaker to play music from our phones because the sound quality is so good.\nThe wire wraps around the speaker when not needed.\nIt is easy to set up and use, even though the instructions are garbage.\nI am extremely impressed with this unit.\nIt is a game changer in our office.\nI have been paying attention to this series of products for a long time. The Luna Plus I ordered was accidentally lost during delivery. It happened that I bought the more powerful Luna plus Kit this time. We use it in group meetings and it works really well. It has super noise reduction ability, even after amplifying the volume, it can still block out most of the background noise, and it does not produce echo. The large-capacity rechargeable battery can meet the full-day conference use after a single charge, avoiding the embarrassment of running out of power halfway. Use The upgraded Dongle to quickly connect to the computer, super convenient and practical. Luna Plus Kit is the first choice for small meetings and recommended.\nI was hosting a call and the speaker I was using made it difficult for my audience to hear me. They said that I was going in and out. I switched to this speaker and the sound difference was unbelievable. Not only were they able to hear me, I was able to hear them with such clarity. Amazing product. Easy to hook up.\nGreat stuff for company meeting, I use it for it. Bluetooth Speakerphone\nand noise reduction easy use for 15 people. Great design and great device, great quality and reasonable price.\nThis webcam is fantastic. The sound is of good quality, and there are several privacy modes available. The video works great and provides an excellent picture.\nPrivacy Modes:?\n* Turning on the device's or remote's webcam and audio\n* Turn off the webcam by itself using the remote or device.\n* Turning off the audio causes the device's indicator lights to turn red.\nIt has intelligent modes like the ability to split the video up between people, and it seemed to work with two people in the room. In speech mode, you can move the left and right arrow buttons to move the camera left and right. It does not have true 360-degree video because you have to move the camera around to get it to show 360 degrees around you in an office.\nHow does it power on?\nIt has a power cord that goes into the outlet and then hooks up to the DC12V connection.\nHow does it hook up to my computer?\nIt connects to a USB C port on the device, and you can use the adapter to convert USB C to USB A or just use the USB C. I tried to test the adapter, and it provided very slow audio and video feedback. So I switched over to USB C directly into my Macbook Pro, and it worked great.\nIf you need a conference and want to show multiple people, I would definitely go with this one.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates\nBy subscribing, you agree to EMEET Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nEMEETLINK\nEMEETSTREAM"

Everyone should be heard and seen. Everyone's thoughts should be recorded. Everyone's feelings should be concerned.\nIn August 2016, with the mission of \"better communication, better world\", five passionate engineers gathered in a small workplace, hoping to use the power of technology to create an intelligent mobile collaboration space for every value contributor. This is where it all began.\nToday, EMEET has transformed into a leading global company mainly engaged in the R&D, production and sales of intelligent audio and video communication products and cloud services driven by self-developed AI.\nAs of now, EMEET has been granted more than 200 core invention patents and other patents in the field of audio and video in China, the U.S., Japan and Europe, with a global presence and serving more than 3 billion people.\n>55%\n300,000+\n180,000,000+\nWhat We Make\nConference Camera\nSpeakerphone\nWebcam\nHeadset\nIntelligence-Driven Innovation\nEMEET never stops innovating, hoping to reform the field of audio and video with the power of intelligence and bring the best solution to every customer around the globe.
