        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024: RingConn Aims To Revolutionize Fitness Tech With Its Smart Ring\nDr. Hao Wu (Tony), co-founder, RingConn\nRingConn, founded in 2021 by Professor Guoxing Wang and his two partners, is taking on Oura with its new Smart Ring. It is the best time to do so because the $147.1 million smart ring market size of 2022 is expected to reach $1,405.1 million by 2032 with a compounded annual growth rate of 25.4%, according to a DataHorizzon Research report.\nWhile we expect more competition in the category in the coming years, it is likely to be defined by people who understand biomedical devices and develop algorithms that work the best for each individual \u2013 instead of building generalized products with no actionable insights.\nThere are plenty of cheap smart wearables that I\u2019ve tested, which lie in the latter category. And it\u2019s a challenge to build something that aims to be a category-defining product \u2013 that\u2019s what Professor Wang is focusing on with the RingConn Smart Ring.\nThis is not his first venture, as he has helped build biomedical devices before. He built the integrated circuits chip for a company called Second Sight that worked on restoring vision for the visually impaired. His expertise lies in circuit design with a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California. I sat down for a conversation with Professor Wang to discuss RingConn, the future of smart rings, and what he aims to deliver with his first product.\nProfessor Guoxing Wang, founder, RingConn\nFC Barcelona Coach Xavi Showed What He Thinks Of Striker In Copa Del Rey Defeat\nReal Madrid Boss Ancelotti Would Welcome Saudi Exile Club Legend Back, Reports OK Diario\nChargers Get Their Man In Jim Harbaugh With An Eye-Popping Hire\n(.. Continuing our conversation talking about Second Sight) You are a professor now. Why come back to the engineering side of things and establish a personal health technology company?\nI worked on this remarkable product and we were successful because after the impression (of the device in the eye) the visually impaired were able to see to an extent. They could see a card on their hand and could walk on the roadside. So that was helpful although the commercial side was not that bright because it was very expensive and it didn\u2019t get the insurance company to back up.\nBut that was a very crucial experience for me. I\u2019ve been working as a professor for 10 years, so I felt that there\u2019s still some engineering inside myself. I want to make products for people to be able to use them and not just to publish a bunch of papers. So that\u2019s why I started the company RingConn.\nWhen I worked in biomedical I connected circuit research with biological applications. At that time I knew that healthcare devices are very much needed. And that they can be very helpful, especially wearable devices. For example, with the retinal process I developed before it was so rewarding and amazing when people could see. After more than 10 years of research and development for smartwatches, I think it\u2019s time for us to have something better.\nFor instance, smartwatches aren\u2019t comfortable to be worn at night, and you cannot accurately track various health metrics. That\u2019s where I thought a smart ring could be the answer.\nHow is the RingConn Smart Ring different from other trackers, like the Oura Ring or the Ultrahuman Ring?\nI think we have made a better product in terms of the accuracy of recording vital signs. For example, the heart rate, oxygen saturation level and body temperature are more accurate. Although it\u2019s very difficult for the consumers to sense it, they can verify this by testing other products. It\u2019s not easy but we have tested, and we got more accurate readings.\nSecond, we have developed a product that can be used for seven days with a single charge. That\u2019s because we have opted for a low-power-consuming electronics design.\nThe third thing is, we designed a more ergonomic product. When you wear our Smart Ring on your finger, it feels much better because the design is not fully circular but a little bit square on the side. This way, it doesn\u2019t hurt your finger. The bone doesn\u2019t have a circular shape and it\u2019s a bit squarish, so our shell is also of the same design. This fits your finger much more comfortably.\nI\u2019ve used a couple of rings with fully circular design, and they felt uncomfortable with bumping against other fingers, so I agree with you on that. However, I\u2019ll have to try the RingConn Smart Ring for myself to see how much more comfortable it is.\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely there and that\u2019s the difference you can feel.\nTalking about accuracy, how did you make it more accurate? How is it more accurate than a smartwatch?\nYes. And I think it\u2019s much better than a smartwatch because it fits the finger, so you can get more accurate data from the sensors than on the wrist. The sensors are closer to large blood vessels on a finger rather than on the wrist.\nWe got it to be more accurate because we put a lot of research effort into this. Others probably don\u2019t really understand how much of a profound impact this could have. This way, we know how to optimize the hardware and algorithms and how to control the sensors for the best readings. We put a lot of emphasis on research from our side as well as a research collaboration with university because as a professor I know the upside of the latter \u2013 they can help in some other areas and make the algorithm better.\nSo I think we sort of combined the best of both academia and development to get the best algorithms on the market so far.\nOkay, on the accuracy, how accurate is the data for stress monitoring and sleep?\nI think for stress tracking there is no golden standard yet. We developed stress tracking by using the heart rate in this circle (pointing to a part on the index finger), which has hundreds of variations under stress, and we tune the algorithm accordingly. I checked the stress levels for myself and found that they are really accurate because whenever I have meetings my stress level is much higher, like right now [laughs].\nIf there is no golden standard for it, how do you know it is accurate?\nYeah, there\u2019s no standard that is agreed upon by everyone. But there are some ways to predict that you\u2019re stressed. Like by using the variations of blood flow in the index finger. People in the medical sector have found that the higher your heart rate variability is, the more relaxed you are.\nOkay, and despite monitoring 24x7, how did you achieve the 7-day battery life target?\nAs I said earlier, we put a lot of effort into research. The most important sensor is the PPG sensor, which records the flow of blood inside the blood vessels. And it consumes the most battery. It sends light signals to the blood vessels that travel across your fingers and reflect back to the sensor.\nSo we focused on finding the best way to optimize it and use the least energy possible. Another way is on the algorithm side. We divide the algorithms inside the firmware side and control the whole system, including the electronics, the wireless transmission and all the calculation of signals to make it more efficient. We developed the best circuit design and the best algorithms.\nIs it a proprietary circuit design by RingConn?\nYeah, it\u2019s all developed by ourselves.\nThere are plenty of fitness trackers that give me scores, like the sleep score or a stress score or throw a lot of numbers at me. But it\u2019s difficult to make sense of all those numbers. Did you work on giving more actionable insights based on these numbers?\nFor things like stress, as you use it, you realize what induces more stress. For example, I know my stress levels increased during the meeting, and maybe I can be more mindful of it and adjust my lifestyle. Like, I know when I start meetings I should take deeper breaths and relax a little bit. So that\u2019s how I think we use the stress level index.\nFor the sleep score, I know there\u2019s a lot of sleep-tracking software on the market. But what we are trying to do is calculate the sleep score based on the duration of your sleep and the sleep stages. There\u2019s all sorts of optimal range of your sleep, and our app gives a suggested range for different sleep stages that can help people understand how the sleep score is calculated, so they can make suitable lifestyle changes.\nI know some say that a person should sleep a specific x amount of hours through the night but I think that\u2019s not true for everybody because people have different sleeping habits. And people in different age groups sleep differently. In summer, people should sleep for a different duration than in winter. We give users the option to input their best sleep duration and then we calculate the sleep score based on the users\u2019 own judgement.\nDoes it include naps?\nYes. We give users the option to include sleep targets and naps are included in the target.\n\u201cAI\u201d being the buzzword currently, is AI involved in any of this?\nYes. We use the most advanced algorithms yet for the calculation of scores and sleep apnea index calculation.\nAnd is all of this FDA-approved? If not, do you have a timeframe for it?\nNot yet. We haven\u2019t received the clearance yet but it is in the works. We expect it to come out by the end of this year.\nI see on the website, there are \u201cworkout mode\u201d and \u201csleep apnea\u201d features coming soon. Could you please explain what are these?\n(Talking about the workout mode) Yeah, it\u2019s an upcoming feature, and I would let the people wait and find out what it is when it rolls out [laughs].\nBut let me tell you more about what we\u2019re developing with sleep apnea. It\u2019s a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. It is common for people who snore. For some people, it affects the brain because you inhale less oxygen than required. Imagine if you are sleeping every night and you don\u2019t get enough oxygen then it accumulates, which can be very dangerous.\nWe have developed algorithms that can alert the next morning about how many times you `stopped breathing. If it is too serious, we will suggest you go see a doctor. I think it will be helpful for a lot of people. And it will be released very soon.\nDo you see the RingConn Smart Ring making a difference in people\u2019s lives?\nYes. I think people are not satisfied by smartwatches. And I think our Smart Ring can do a much better job because it can get more accurate signals from the finger. Plus, they can do more with it, like detect sleep apnea. We are working on more features and they are coming soon.\nI think we can make a big difference because instead of just making sort of a toy like some smart bands or smartwatches, we are offering accurate tracking.\nRight now, your app is free but the competitors like Oura and Ultrahuman have paid subscriptions. Do you plan on introducing a paid tier on the RingConn app?\nYes. But for all the basic functions, we are going to keep it free. We\u2019ll explore the paid tier will offer more advanced functions like sleep apnea but we\u2019ll decide based on the driving cost how the market reacts to them. However, all the features currently available are going to be free.\nThe Smart Ring is your first product. Do you plan on expanding the product line in the future?\nAt this stage, I think the Smart Ring is such a wonderful product and there are a lot of possibilities to explore. But for now, we are going to focus on this.\nRingConn Smart Ring\nAdding to this, I talked more about RingConn\u2019s R&D efforts with co-founder Dr. Hao Wu (Tony), who is an Assistant Professor at Shenzhen University, transcript below:\nHow is the RingConn Smart Ring different from other rings in the market from R&D perspective? I\u2019ve learned that the circuit design has been done in-house How does that help me as a user?\nOn the RingConn Smart Ring, we have PPG sensors, a skin temperature sensor, and an accelerometer. It\u2019s both the hardware and software that distinguishes it from other wearables.\nWe designed the circuits ourselves with a very good design of the LED distribution so they can take high-quality measurements. And because of this we could tune the software for better accuracy.\nYou\u2019re seeking FDA approval and adding sleep apnea detection to the Smart Ring. Does the feature\u2019s rollout depend on getting the approval?\nYes, we have applied for two FDA certifications and one is for sleep apnea detection. Both of them are likely to be issued by the end of this year (2024). And no, we do not need to wait for FDA approval to roll out the feature. It is already available in open beta for our users. We are still testing it.\nDo you plan on introducing blood pressure monitoring and blood sugar monitoring?\nTwo different things. For blood pressure measurement, we have already been researching it for like seven years. We have had some good progress in the last year. We are doing the blood pressure measurements on the ring. As for blood sugar tracking, it\u2019s not easy and we haven\u2019t started any research on it yet.\nDo you have the hardware for blood pressure monitoring on this version?\nNo, we are thinking of introducing it in the next version.\nThe conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nI\u2019m currently using the RingConn Smart Ring for review. My initial impressions are positive, and the flatter sides do make a difference in making it more comfortable."

With features ranging from health tracking to menstrual cycle insights, smart rings will definitely change the way you view the \"usual\" rings.\nThe Smart Ring Revolution\nThe\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0unveiled a myriad of smart rings, and it's surprising to see them along with other products. They are not just accessories; they are multifunctional tools capable of tracking sleep, facilitating NFC payments, and delivering real-time health insights- all without the bulkiness of a smartwatch.\nWhat's more, smart rings offer a discreet alternative to traditional wearables, making them an attractive choice for those who seek subtlety in their tech accessories.\nRelated Article:\u00a0CES 2024: This Mila HomeKit-Compatible Solutions Can Improve Air Quality at Home\nThe Year of the Smart Ring\nWith the influx of new products and launches, 2024 is poised to be the year when smart rings dominate the wearable tech scene.\nProjections from\u00a0DataHorizzon Research\u00a0suggest that the smart ring market size will surpass $1 billion by 2032. As more major tech brands express interest, the smart ring market is expected to expand further, with potential entries from industry giants like Samsung adding weight to this growing trend.\nBest CES 2024 Smart Rings\nRingConn Smart Ring: A Subscription-Free Experience\nRingConn's Smart Ring, priced at $279, stands out by eliminating the need for additional subscriptions.

Take the rings unveiled at this year's CES, the tech industry's largest consumer technology convention of the year: We saw rings that track your menstrual cycle and use AI to offer relevant health insights, rings that hone in on athletic recovery data, and rings that make tracking health information more simple and efficient.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's next in tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nSmart rings are the future wrapped around your finger: They can track your sleep, function as a form of NFC payment, and provide by-the-minute health insights without the bulkiness and additional screen of a smartwatch. Plus, they're far more discreet than other wearables.\n\"Smart rings offer an opportunity to seamlessly track one's health with a small, screenless form factor,\" says Stacy Salvi, vice president of product and strategy at Movano Health, makers of the Evie smart ring. \"Consumers want an easy way to wear a device for an extended period without having to charge daily, which is the case with many smart watches. Because there is no screen on a ring, data is viewed exclusively on an app, which has more real estate to communicate the critical metrics in an engaging and fun way while also being informative.\"\nWith all these new products unveiling and launching, 2024 is ramping up to be the year of the smart ring. And we're just getting started: The smart ring market size is expected to grow to an over $1 billion industry by 2032, according to a recent report by DataHorizzon Research. Expect more smart rings to hit the market this year and next, with larger tech brands (did we see that Samsung might be entering the smart ring race with a new Galaxy Ring?) throwing their hat in the ring -- pun intended.\nAlso: The best smart rings\nI've rounded up the most notable smart rings on display at CES that ZDNET's team got to check out, and that are worthy of your attention this year. Some are available to buy now, and some are available for purchase later this year.\nThe top smart rings of CES\nMovano Evie Ring\nWe've been excited about the Evie Ring since last year, when Movano unveiled its product concept at CES 2023. The Evie Ring is the first women-focused smart ring that uses the health data it tracks to offer up a holistic view of overall health and wellness -- and it just earned a 2024 CES Innovation Honoree Award.\nWhat differentiates the Evie Ring from other smart rings on the market is its women-specific data that pairs with an AI engine to offer predictive insights into a women's menstrual health, mood, sleep, physical activity, and more. Plus, the ring includes a notable smart metric, called Daily Summary, which offers up an at-a-glance activity and recovery graphic for succinct health data visualization (so you can spend less time parsing rogue graphs together and more time digging into health solutions with tangible results).\nAlso:\u00a0This women's smart health ring uses AI to analyze menstrual and sleep data\nNo additional subscription nor membership is necessary with this $269 ring. Get the smart ring in silver, gold, or rose gold. The product is expected to ship later this month.\nRingConn Smart Ring\nMost smart rings come with a subscription you have to buy in addition to the already-expensive smart ring itself. The subscriptions, like the Oura Ring membership, tend to offer supplementary insights on sleep data, personalized health insights, and a glance at your health trends over time.\nLike the Evie Ring, RingConn's smart ring sidesteps the subscriptions and offers you comprehensive health data without the additional cost of a subscription. At $279, RingConn's Smart Ring comes in Moonlit Silver, Midnight Black, and Pale Gold, with a titanium build and a matte finish. Along with a one-week battery life, the ring also comes with a portable charging case that can keep your ring powered for up to 150 days.\nAlso: RingConn takes on Oura with an impressive subscription-free smart ring\nZDNET contributing writer Matt Miller got his hands on the RingConn smart ring, and praised it for its substantial battery life and powerful smartphone app.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nWith Amazfit's Helio Ring, all your sleep and health data is stored in one app -- no smartwatch necessary. \"When you wake up, you can put on the watch while wearing the ring -- or not -- and all of your health, wellness, and sports activity data will be synced and available in the Zepp app (formerly Amazfit) on your smartphone,\"ZDNET contributing writer Matt Miller reported.\nUsing a smart watch and the ring together is the real deal, since a watch can better measure activities and track your exercise through GPS, while the ring can monitor your sleep and resting modes. For these reasons, the ring seems optimal for someone who's already plugged into the wearable ecosystem and looking to wear both a watch and a ring for health data tracking.\nAlso: One ring, one app: Amazfit's new smart ring integrates sleep and fitness data\nThe ring will launch with ring sizes 10 and 12, with more ring sizes and colors coming later this year.\nOther smart rings to watch\nElevate meditation\nYogiFi Ring\nTrack your mind, body, and breath with this smart ring made for yogis. The ring tracks your yoga asanas, meditation sessions, and sleep.\nAnother smart ring\nDcare Ring\nLearn more about your heart health, sleep, and steps with this $200 smart ring.\nComfortable smart ring\nUltrahuman Ring Air\nComfort is the Ultrahuman Ring's main priority. Keep your sleep, movement, and recovery in check with the smart ring's data insights.\nRelated\nThe best smart rings of 2024\nThe best smartwatches of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\nThe best Android smartwatches in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed"
