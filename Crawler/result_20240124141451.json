Here is a quick update based on trending topics received from HDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc. (HDMI LA), the official agent of the HDMI Specifications, from Trudi Bordi, vice president of licensing, and Brad Bramy, vice president of marketing and operations.\nQ: What are licensed HDMI Products, and are unlicensed products the same as counterfeit HDMI products?\nA: Trudi Bordi: Most importantly,manufacturers and resellers rely on doing business with licensed HDMI Adopters. A licensed product is produced by a manufacturer that is an official HDMI Adopter and has access to the current HDMI Specifications; and can claim compliance to the HDMI Specifications when their products are tested and certified at either an HDMI Authorized Test Center (ATC), or for HDMI 2.1a products, an HDMI Forum ATC.\nYes, unlicensed HDMI products are counterfeit and run the risk of being seized and a company is at risk of punitive actions.\nQ: Is the list of HDMI Adopters on the hdmi.org website the best way to check for licensed manufacturers?\nThe Future of Digital Lighting & Control\nA: Trudi Bordi: Adopters are proudly listed on the HDMI.org website so the industry knows where to find licensed manufacturers. Adopters can also show their HDMI Adopter Certificate which has a unique QR code, and the scan displays the HDMI.org website adopter listing for verification. You can also ask to see the ATC Certificate for the product. Now, not all manufacturers need to be HDMI Adopters, and so they won\u2019t be on the list, but they still have to source from an adopter, and that can make verifying more complex. You just have to make sure your manufacturer is providing licensed HDMI products.\nQ: What are the risks, and what are the punitive actions that can happened to a company marketing unlicensed HDMI products?\nA: Trudi Bordi: Our international compliance team is responsible for many product seizures. These seizures can involve trade show booths where unlicensed products are removed and detained, factory raids, and seizures by local customs officials. In Asia we also work with government entities to enforce on IP including issuing fines and penalties against infringing companies. In Taiwan, we also have the infringing company issue a public apology in the local newspapers which can lead to loss of business reputation.\nBrad Bramy: Sometimes manufacturers don\u2019t know they are sourcing unlicensed product until they find products they ordered are seized and are then unable to deliver products to their customers resulting in non-delivery penalties and even the loss of contracts. Retailers find themselves without inventory and lose sales and customers. Resellers should demand suppliers provide only licensed products, make it a requirement in their terms and conditions, and even ask to see validating paperwork.\nQ: There are so many economic uncertainties for consumers, what do you see as the opportunities manufacturers and resellers should consider for product planning?\nA: Brad Bramy: In talking to resellers, they see that although consumers are concerned with rising costs, there are still opportunities to offer the newest features at very affordable prices, such as HDMI 2.1a supported features 4K@120Hz, Dynamic HDR, and immersive hi-res audio with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC). And for many consumers, there is still demand for premium top-of-the-line models at higher prices that offer a broad range of advanced features.\nQ: Why are so many TV manufacturers promoting gaming features in their latest products?\nA: Brad Bramy: The current HDMI 2.1a specification has helped motivate TV manufacturers to support advanced gaming features such as Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) as well as 4K@120Hz,\u00a0 giving consumers new options beyond gaming monitors. This also allows TV manufacturers and installers to expand their product lineup to the world-wide gaming market for the first time including hard-core gaming enthusiast, families, and even the new eSports venues.\nQ: And what is the latest from the HDMI Specification?\nA: Brad Bramy: It was updated to HDMI 2.1a in February and introduced a new feature called Source-Based Tone Mapping or SBTM. Not all displays have the same HDR capability; some have different ranges of color and brightness levels than others. And sometimes, a source device needs to combine different types of content (HDR, SDR, dynamic HDR, graphics) together at the same time. SBTM enables the source to send a video signal that takes full advantage of a specific display\u2019s HDR capability by adjusting its output to take better advantage of each display\u2019s potential.\u00a0SBTM adds an additional HDR capability to HDMI-enabled products, offering consumers additional high-quality viewing experiences.\nFor more information on HDMI licensing and specifications visit www.hdmi.org.

As 4K content distribution becomes widely available and products with the newest HDMI 2.1 specification\u2019s ultra high speed bandwidth-dependent features are in-market, it\u2019s critical that cables and devices work together seamlessly and trouble-free.\nHDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc. (HDMI LAI) is the only organization that licenses the HDMI specifications, and it is the primary source of cable information and has authorized cable compliance programs. HDMI LA is the agent appointed by the HDMI Forum to license Version 2.1 of the HDMI Specification and is also the agent appointed by the HDMI Founders to license the 1.4b HDMI Specification. HDMI LA is tasked with enforcing compliance to the HDMI specifications and the HDMI adopted trademarks and logos. It is also responsible for promoting specification features including information on cables.\u00a0 With misinformation spread about HDMI features, testing and certification, HDMI LA is the exclusive source for factual information.\nWhat is the Licensed HDMI Technology Eco-System of Compliance?\nIt starts with manufacturers who must become licensed HDMI Adopters in order to access and use the HDMI specifications and use the HDMI trademarks and logos. And where do the specs originate? The HDMI Founders produced the 1.4b specification and since 2013 the HDMI Forum all subsequent versions, with the latest being Specification Version 2.1. The HDMI Forum is comprised of almost 80 companies that collaborate on the specification. They also produce the Compliance Test Specifications (CTS) for testing and certifying compliance; and do so in collaboration with authorized test equipment manufacturers whose equipment is used for testing, and HDMI Forum Authorized Test Centers (Forum ATCs) where the testing and certification takes place. This rock-solid system pertains to all HDMI product categories including cables.\nSpecial HDMI Cable Certification Programs\nAll HDMI cables must be tested for compliance with the specification and in addition there are two special certification programs administered by HDMI LA for added compliance assurance with anti-counterfeiting labeling.\nThe Premium HDMI\u00ae Cable Certification Program was launched in 2015 for High Speed HDMI Cables and adds testing and certification to ensure support for 4K@60Hz and 18Gbps bandwidth. All lengths of cables must be tested at HDMI ATCs and pass EMI testing. With more 4K content being distributed, this cable is vital to both the consumer and commercial sectors especially cable, satellite and IPTV set-top box installations. It also requires packaging to display the Premium HDMI Cable Certification Label for added verification of compliance and to prevent counterfeiting.\nA Transition into Landscape Lighting\nThe new Ultra High Speed HDMI\u00ae Cable Certification Program is soon launching and supports the new Ultra High Speed HDMI Cables from the HDMI 2.1 specification. It\u2019s the only cable that complies with stringent specifications designed to ensure support for all HDMI 2.1 features including uncompressed 8k@60 and 4K@120 and the increased bandwidth of 48Gbps. The program is mandatory for all Ultra High Speed HDMI Cables; and ensures quality cables reach the market and support 4K and 8K video, HDR, VRR, eARC, and all other HDMI 2.1 features. All certified cables of any length must pass certification testing at an HDMI Forum ATC and be tested to meet current EMI requirements to minimize wireless interference. Cables will be required to affix an Ultra High Speed HDMI Certification Label to each package.\nBoth certification programs utilize the proprietary HDMI LA certification scanning app available to end-users to verify certification and check the reseller brand and cable length. Also, both programs include HDMI LA audits of marketplace cables to ensure that production cables continue to pass certification testing during their product lifetime.

GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they can get out of sync, causing visible hitching and artifacts that pull you out of the action. ROG is proud to introduce the first-ever OLED display in a laptop capable of using NVIDIA\u00ae G-SYNC, which allows the refresh rate of the display to synchronize with the GPU\u2019s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag.\nDolby Vision\u00ae Technology\nScene to scene, frame to frame, Dolby Vision makes media look better. The technology improves on standard 4K high dynamic range (HDR) video, dynamically adjusting visuals to make every image in front of you richer, brighter, and livelier. Creators can film and edit their streams, videos, and other content in a format commonly used by industry professionals.\nPantone\u00ae Color Validation\nEach IPS-level display is factory-calibrated to ensure that colors are accurate to the Pantone\u00ae palette. Artists, designers, and content creators can add high-quality content to their portfolios and enjoy richer gaming visuals all on the same machine.\n100% DCI-P3 Color Coverage\nWhile the sRGB color space is the standard for most digital visuals, it only represents about 75% of the DCI-P3 spectrum used for professional filmmaking. Displays with complete DCI-P3 coverage offer a wide color gamut for more vibrant images, and with a Delta E of less than 1*, the Zephyrus G14\u2019s display lets you experience films and other media exactly the way they were meant to be seen.\n*Average tested result in MyASUS / Armoury Crate Splendid Display P3 and sRGB color gamut: Delta E < 1, +/- 0.5, and may vary by specification.

In the Silent operating mode, the cooling system switches off all fans during everyday tasks to dissipate heat passively. This lets you concentrate on your work and immerse yourself in movies with less distraction. If CPU or GPU temperatures increase, the fans automatically switch on again.\nRedesigned keyboard\nPrevious keyboard designs focused on keeping the chassis temperatures cool, keeping your fingers comfortable during long gaming sessions. The newly redesigned keyboard not only keeps your hands comfortable on the trackpad and keyboard deck but increases air intake for the main system components as well, boosting the Zephyrus G14\u2019s cooling performance without increasing weight or chassis size.\nHeatsink\nAt the heart of every great laptop is a great cooling solution. Despite its ultra-thin chassis, the Zephyrus G14 features a dual exhaust heatsink that helps to efficiently pass heat outside the machine for sustained performance. By placing these heatsinks closer to the chassis, heated air travels more efficiently out of the machine than ever before, reducing recirculation.\nTri-Fan Technology\nOur Tri-Fan Technology directs air though precisely calculated cutouts in the chassis, sending airflow directly towards internal components to keep them cool in all conditions. A third auxiliary fan sends additional heat from the GPU and VRAM directly to the heatsinks, keeping the machine cool during long video renders or gaming sessions.\n2nd Gen Arc Flow Fans\nThe Zephyrus G14 is the first generation of ROG laptop to receive our redesigned 2nd Gen Arc Flow Fans\u2122. We\u2019ve added small bends at the end of each of the 84 primary blades that reduce both power consumption and turbulence. The fans also now feature a dual-impeller design, with a smaller set of 42 fan blades inside that allow more air to be sucked through with each rotation of the fan, similar to a jet turbine. These fans consume 16% less power while increasing airflow by 11%, enabling the high-performance components inside to run their very best.\nLiquid Metal\nLiquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly reduces CPU temperatures by up to 13\u00b0C compared to standard thermal paste. Applying it onto CPUs is delicate work, so ROG commissioned custom equipment to automate the process with mechanical precision, and designed a patented internal fence to contain the compound.\nHeatpipe\nHeatpipes are critically important for a laptop\u2019s cooling system, especially in a thin-and-light form factor like the G14. For 2024, we\u2019re introducing a new fiber and mesh heatpipe that offers a 26% efficiency improvement over the previous groove and powder based design.\nDust Filter\nDust and fibers can collect inside the machine, trapping heat and causing degraded performance over time. A filter over the air intakes helps keep dust out, allowing the CPU and GPU to breathe easier for years of smooth and stable operation.\n*Internal testing in a simulated dusty environment\nExhaust Vents\nThe Zephyrus G14 features a dual exhaust heatsink, with one next to the laptop\u2019s rubber feet, exhausting air downward, and one at the rear of the machine, exhausting air underneath our new display hinge and keeping it away from the screen.\n0db Ambient Cooling\nEnjoy truly silent cooling under light workloads with 0dB Ambient Cooling technology.

This is a quick update based on trending topics received from HDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc. (HDMI LA), the official agent of the HDMI Specifications, from Trudi Bordi, vice president of licensing, and Brad Bramy, vice president of marketing and operations.\nTrudi Bordi, HDMI LA VP of licensing & Brad Bramy, HDMI LA VP of marketing\nWhat are licensed HDMI products, and are unlicensed products the same as counterfeit HDMI products?\nTrudi Bordi: Most importantly, manufacturers and resellers rely on doing business with licensed HDMI Adopters. A licensed product is produced by a manufacturer that is an official HDMI Adopter and has access to the current HDMI Specifications; and can claim compliance to the HDMI Specifications when their products are tested and certified at either an HDMI Authorized Test Center (ATC), or for HDMI 2.1a products, an HDMI Forum ATC.\nYes, unlicensed HDMI products are counterfeit and run the risk of being seized and a company is at risk of punitive actions.\nIs the list of HDMI Adopters on the hdmi.org website the best way to check for licensed manufacturers?\nTrudi Bordi: Adopters are proudly listed on the HDMI.org website so the industry knows where to find licensed manufacturers. Adopters can also show their HDMI Adopter Certificate which has a unique QR code, and the scan displays the HDMI.org website adopter listing for verification. You can also ask to see the ATC Certificate for the product. Now, not all manufacturers need to be HDMI Adopters, and so they won\u2019t be on the list, but they still have to source from an adopter, and that can make verifying more complex. You just have to make sure your manufacturer is providing licensed HDMI products.\nWhat are the risks, and what are the punitive actions that can happened to a company marketing unlicensed HDMI products?\nTrudi Bordi: Our international compliance team is responsible for many product seizures. These seizures can involve trade show booths where unlicensed products are removed and detained, factory raids, and seizures by local customs officials. In Asia we also work with government entities to enforce on IP including issuing fines and penalties against infringing companies. In Taiwan, we also have the infringing company issue a public apology in the local newspapers which can lead to loss of business reputation.\nBrad Bramy: Sometimes manufacturers don\u2019t know they are sourcing unlicensed product until they find products they ordered are seized and are then unable to deliver products to their customers resulting in non-delivery penalties and even the loss of contracts. Retailers find themselves without inventory and lose sales and customers. Resellers should demand suppliers provide only licensed products, make it a requirement in their terms and conditions, and even ask to see validating paperwork.\nThere are so many economic uncertainties for consumers, what do you see as the opportunities manufacturers and resellers should consider for product planning?\nBrad Bramy: In talking to resellers, they see that although consumers are concerned with rising costs, there are still opportunities to offer the newest features at very affordable prices, such as HDMI 2.1a supported features 4K@120Hz, Dynamic HDR, and immersive hi-res audio with Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC). And for many consumers, there is still demand for premium top-of-the-line models at higher prices that offer a broad range of advanced features.\nWhy are so many TV manufacturers promoting gaming features in their latest products?\nBrad Bramy: The current HDMI 2.1a specification has helped motivate TV manufacturers to support advanced gaming features such as Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) as well as 4K@120Hz,\u00a0 giving consumers new options beyond gaming monitors. This also allows TV manufacturers and installers to expand their product lineup to the world-wide gaming market for the first time including hard-core gaming enthusiast, families, and even the new eSports venues.\nAnd what is the latest from the HDMI Specification?\nBrad Bramy: It was updated to HDMI 2.1a in February and introduced a new feature called Source-Based Tone Mapping or SBTM. Not all displays have the same HDR capability; some have different ranges of color and brightness levels than others. And sometimes, a source device needs to combine different types of content (HDR, SDR, dynamic HDR, graphics) together at the same time. SBTM enables the source to send a video signal that takes full advantage of a specific display\u2019s HDR capability by adjusting its output to take better advantage of each display\u2019s potential.\u00a0SBTM adds an additional HDR capability to HDMI-enabled products, offering consumers additional high-quality viewing experiences.\nFor more information on HDMI licensing and specifications visit www.hdmi.org.
