(AP Photo/John Locher)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Welcome to CES 2024. This multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is expected to bring some 130,000 attendees and more than 4,000 exhibitors to Las Vegas. The latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more will be on display, with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will keep a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the latest announcements to most quirky smart gadgets.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL ROBOTIC MASSEUSE\nArtificial intelligence has been seen powering smart home hubs, cars, TVs, medical devices and even fingernail printers at CES 202, now the technology is even giving massages.\nCreated by French company Capsix Robotics, iYU uses artificial intelligence to perform a real-time body scan and recommend the best kind of experience for the user. A robotic arm then performs a variety of techniques, whether it\u2019s a massage for pressure or a deep massage for muscles.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s every day massage,\u201d says Capsix Robotics founder Francois Eyssautier.\nWANT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD FOR YOUR iPHONE?\nIt\u2019s a new product but the functionality might ring familiar \u2014 Clicks Technologies\u2019 iPhone keyboard is making a splash at CES 2024.\nThe smartphone accessory is aimed at, according to co-founder Johnathan Young, three core audiences: iPhone users with dexterity or accessibility issues, the younger generation looking to stand out, and people who miss their previous smartphone keyboards.\nWhen asked about the product\u2019s reception at the annual tech conference, Young said;\n\u201cWell we had expectations for CES. Let\u2019s just say they\u2019ve been blown apart because it\u2019s been absolutely fantastic.\u201d\nPrices range from $139 to $159.\nGETTNG YOUR VOICE BACK\nDutch startup Whispp aims to use artificial intelligence to help millions of people suffering from vocal impairments speak again in their natural voices.\nWhile many current assistive technologies focus on speech-to-text or text-to-speech, Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI, resulting in almost real-time speech conversion.\nUsers also have the unique ability to recreate their distinct voice by providing recordings of their current or past voice, adding a personalized touch to their own communication.\nAt CES 2024, Whispp launched an AI-powered assistive speech and phone-calling app.\nMARTHA STEWART, TECHNOLOGIST\nLast night, businesswoman and media personality Martha Stewart took to the kitchen stage at the Samsung CES booth to craft her famed \u201cMartha-tini\u201d and smashed potatoes using the company\u2019s SmartThings technology.\nAs a bonus, the famed cooking, entertaining and homemaking celebrity revealed how she first got hooked onto the tech culture scene.\n\u201cWell, I got my first computer in 1982. An IBM. I still have it. ... and all my friends and I would sit up all night long trying to figure out what the computer could do for us.\u201d\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ballie projects itself into your heart\nBefore CES even began Samsung declared it was all-in on AI. This includes using vision models to tell you what food to make based on the contents of your fridge, launching new large language models for its cellphones and bringing smart robots to your home.\nBallie is part entertainment device, part chatbot and part home assistant. The round robot can project things onto the floor, wall or ceiling as it follows you around the home like a lost puppy.\nThe yellow bot can also message its owner to give an update on the pets, manage smart tech in the home and even answer calls on your behalf.\nThe problem is right now it's nothing more than a video. When the first version of Ballie was unveiled in 2020 a model was whizzing around the stage. This year we\u2019ve only seen it in a video, with no details on price, launch or availability.\n2. LG smart home agent\nYou wait all day for a bus then two come along at once. Or in this case, you don\u2019t wait for a tiny, cute robot that can link up with your home appliances but two still come along at once.\nNot to be outdone by Samsung, LG revealed its smart home agent. An AI-packed little bot on two legs that rolls around your home keeping an eye on your smart tech, pets and you.\nLG\u2019s little agent is basically a smart hub that can move about. It has a built-in large language model voice assistant so you can communicate with it in much the same way you can with ChatGPT voice and it can monitor your mood.\nConnected through the LG smart home platform ThinQ, it can manage washers, ovens and even refrigerators unaided. It uses machine learning to understand how the family interacts and uses devices and can perform voice and facial analysis. Like Bailee it has no price, release data or physical model to try out.\n3. Rise of the lawnbot \u2014 Segway Navimow\nRobot lawnmowers aren't a new idea. They've been around about as long as the robot vacuum with new models and companies rising and falling.\nThis year at CES we've seen a multitude of mowers, blowers and other gardening aids and one of the highlights is the Segway Navimow.\nThe Navimow H Series has been available in Europe for some time but is now coming to the U.S. for the first time. It uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard and uses a small base station when GPS isn't available.\nThe H Series range features a BladeHalt sensor, a Rain sensor, an Ultrasonic sensor (H3000), and a VisionFence sensor (H3000), so it should be able to more easily detect and avoid objects on your lawn.\nPricing has not yet been made available for the U.S. market, but when it was released in Europe, the H500E was priced at \u20ac1,199 (about $1,300), the H800 was at \u20ac1,499, and the H3000E cost \u20ac2,499 (about $2,700).\n4. Oro is a buddy for your pets\nBoth Samsung's Ballie and the LG smart home agent boast pet-sitting capabilities, but the adorable big-eyed ORo from Ogmen Robotics goes a step further, being designed as a ball-throwing, food-delivering pet buddy.\nThe autonomous robot can take care of your dog when you're not at home. Priced at $799 and available from April it is fitted way a suit of sensors, two-way audio and an interactive video screen that lets you chat to your canine from anywhere.\nORo can also capture images and videos of your pet at play that you can then share online or keep to look back on. it also has a built-in food dispenser that can launch nibbles at your good boy and a separate automatic food bowl that the bot can control.\nOne of the most impressive features is its built-in AI that learns by watching the way your pet plays. It understands its behavior patterns and can play music or throw a ball when Rover becomes agitated or restless.\nORo is currently available for pre-order with a $299 downpayment with the remaining $500 due when it is ready to ship. It comes in cozy carbon and ivory mist. The price includes hte base-station, the dog bowl and the robot.\n5. Climbing up the stairs \u2014 MOBINN from RcLab\nThe MOBINN is a delivery robot with flexible wheels that allow it to drive on even ground and climb stairs while bringing you that parcel you need urgently.\nIt is a research example at the moment without a date for release or a price but it can maintain a constant and steady horizon for the main body ensuring the Starbucks you ordered doesn't spill on its way from the coffee shop down the street.\nThe M3 has a LiDAR-based mapping system to allow it to operate regardless of the terrain and can also work in rain, snow and at night.\n6. The Loona companion bot\nSometimes all you need to cheer you up is a pet but that isn't always practical. Enter Loona, the companion robot that uses ChatGPT to provide natural conversation with its owner.\nBuilt by Beijing KEYi Technology, the toy can play a range of interactive games, is a moveable home monitor and acts as a programming learning platform.\nThe cute little bot also includes gesture recognition technology, voice commands and graphic programming to allow users to create their own instructions.\nThe base model is $380 with a range of accessories and add-ons available including coding kits, game prop kits and a charging dock.\n7. Robot vacuum phone home\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to the ability to call its owner or have the owner call in remotely.\n6. Elderly companion robot\nIntuition Robotics is bringing generative AI to its elderly care companion robot ElliQ. The third generation of the bot, known as the ElliQ 3 uses AI to offer more engaging and two-way conversations for its users.\nSmaller and lighter than previous versions it also includes a screen fully integrated into the device rather than as a standalone tool.\nA built-in AI processing unit and a RAM increase also makes it easier to use and interact with as it can handle natural language conversations.\nIt also uses generative AI to better utilize information the user shares with the device such as favorite color, pet and religion. It can reference this information in conversations and choose activities based on user interests.\n7. A coffee making robot\nADAM is a robot barista from Richtech Robotics. Impressing at CES 2024 it can make hot or cold coffee with 21 unique menu offerings. It can also turn its hand to cold brew and Boba or mix up a cocktail.\nThe two-armed robot can interact with customers to take their order through a natural language interface, use its arms to make the drink and even wash up.\nEach arm can work independently to create two drinks at the same time and can be customized with different phrases depending on the use case or company.\nADAM is only available as a rental device for specific events. So far it is the main barista in a Manhattan coffee shop, served Boba at Cloutea on the Las Vegas strip and served drinks for Kendall Jenner at hte launch of her 818 Tequila signature bottle launch party.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential. Here's how it happens - and when"

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 From electric cars to transparent TVs to the latest accessibility tech and virtual assistants backed by artificial intelligence, there was a wide range of innovations on display at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. The best of it aimed to solve big real-world problems. Some of it aimed to make your life more fun. And some of it was just a little out there.\nAssociated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.\nHere\u2019s what caught our eye at CES 2024.\nACCESSIBILITY PRODUCTS WERE BIG ON HOPE\nAt a conference where excess and opulence manifested itself in nearly everything, it was encouraging to see how much progress has been made toward developing assistive technologies for the disabled.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help Parkinson\u2019s patients and those with hand tremors regain control of their lives. Dutch startup Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI to give people with vocal impairments a chance to have real-time conversations in their own natural voices. OrCam introduced a host of devices designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. And Sony reserved some prime space in its booth to showcase its Access controller for PlayStation.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEARLY EVERYTHING\nUsing software and AI to achieve inter-device connections between smart devices, your home and even your car was central to many of the biggest tech companies at CES 2024.\nSamsung\u2019s new \u201cAI for all\u201d mantra meant integrating its smart home devices and appliances to perform tasks in unison \u2014 like the act of recipe selection automatically pre-heating your oven. The South Korean tech giant also announced a collaboration with Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services for all Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Google is expanding Chromecast to more apps and devices. And Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard to create more inter-operability between smart devices.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize interactions between drivers and their cars.\nVEHICLES ADVANCES WERE ON FULL DISPLAY\nCES 2024 was brimming with new electric vehicles, remote construction vehicles, hydrogen engines and other mobility advances.\nHonda premiered two concept cars, dubbed the \u201cSaloon\u201d and \u201cSpace-Hub,\u201d for a new global EV series. Kia decided to go modular with a trio of electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to change their functionality. And Vietnam-based electric upstart VinFast unveiled an electric truck concept.\nBosch Mobility and Hyundai both doubled down on hydrogen as an energy solution. And Hyundai showcased its AI-based autonomous construction excavator.\nHOPE YOU\u2019RE HUNGRY\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u2019t need to cook \u2014 or mix drinks \u2014 for themselves anymore.\nGE wants you to start smoke food indoors, while generative AI is powering a Brisk smart grill that aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but ColdSnap\u2019s new ice cream machine prepares your frozen treat in two minutes. And Bartesian\u2019s cocktail-mixing appliance can make as many as 60 different kinds of drinks for you.\nMeanwhile, for much younger consumers (and their parents), Veba Baby\u2019s smart baby bottle monitor tracks the expiration of breast milk and formula. The product \u2014 which also serves as a bottle locator \u2014 monitors the temperature, when a baby feeds from the bottle, and more to detect freshness. And everything is logged onto an accompanying app.\nWHAT\u2019S NEW ON TV?\nOLED, Micro LED, 8k ... what does it all mean? It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "Drone soccer at the Venetian? Here are some cool things we saw at CES\nMore than 4,000 exhibitors are vying for the attention of the technology world at the annual trade show spread out across the Strip.\nThe CES trade show floor opened Tuesday morning with more than 4,000 exhibitors showing off their latest products and innovations in home, auto, beauty, video gaming, computers, cellphones and everything else tech.\nThe four-day technology event is estimated to draw more than 130,000 people to the city, one-third of them from foreign countries. Exhibits are spread across the Strip between the Venetian Expo and Las Vegas Convention Center halls.\nHere are some of the most eye-catching things the Review-Journal saw on the trade show floors.\nNot Quidditch, but drone soccer\nIn an innovative display of drone usage, the Federation of International Dronesoccer Association introduced its blend of technology and sport in the AI/Robotics area of the Venetian Expo. Five players on each team pilot drones encased in wiring resembling a ball as they protect or score into the hoop-like goal hanging on either end of the arena.\nImproving the robotic massage\nConventioneers in the Venetian Expo\u2019s Eureka Park were lining up to relax in one of iYU Spa\u2019s full-body, hands-free massagers.\nThe machine uses artificial intelligence and a medical-quality robotic arm to serve a client lying on a typical massage table.\nDeveloped in 2015 by French startup Capsix Robotics, iYU is launching in the U.S. as a business-to-business product that can be set up in spas, chiropractic offices and franchised clinics.\nThe first of the AI-assisted machines is already in Boulder, Colorado\u2019s Bodywork for Liberation massage clinic. Owner Jonathan Grassi said the standard session is 35 minutes and is sold in a membership model.\nFlying car\nCars aren\u2019t just for roads any more as the Chinese company Xpeng Aeroht showcased its eVTOL flying supercar, which looks like a sleek sports car with arms attached with fans to the top of the car. The vehicle can switch between driving and flying by folding its arms out.\nThe company didn\u2019t say when its flying super car could be available to the public but did say another flying vehicle called its \u201cLand Aircraft Carrier, a van that comes with a modular flying device. It should be available for pre-order at the end of 2024 and deliveries of these flying cars could happen by the end of 2025.\nPortable record player\nMany devices at CES try to push technology forward but one product can help expand the usage of the vinyl record. This product is the Sound Burger, a portable record player from the Japanese company Audio-Technica.\nThis record player is much more mobile than a typical record player since it\u2019s the shape of a brick. A vinyl record is held in the middle so it can easily be put into a backpack or suitcase. Sound Burger has a rechargeable battery that can last for 12 hours and is compatible with bluetooth devices and can project its sound to speakers or compatible headphones, said John Tarulli a Hi-Fi sales manager for Audio-Technica.\nWalking assistance device\nOne exhibitor at CES is trying to make it easier to walk with a smaller battery-powered exoskeleton device. The device is called WIM and it attaches around the waist and to a person\u2019s legs and provides extra support to make it easier to walk or exercise.\nWIM is made by South Korean company Wirobotics and the company plans to launch the product to the Korean market in February of this year and expand into international markets afterwards.\nThis device also comes with an app that can monitor and track a person\u2019s walking and exercise pattern, said Bokman Lim, a Wirobotics engineer. Lim said in the company\u2019s testing phase it found the WIM improved walking speed by up to 20 percent.\nZero-emissions semitruck\nHydrogen powered semitrucks could be on Nevada roads next year as Kentworth was displaying a semitruck powered by hydrogen fuel that produces zero fossil fuel emissions\nThe truck\u2019s official name is TC680 FCEV and it has a range of 450 miles, can reach 70 miles an hour and has a 20 \u2013 30 minute refuel time, said Sarah Abernethy, a powertrain marketing manager for Kentworth.\nThese trucks should start to get on to roads by 2025 and expand substantially in 2026, Abernethy said.\nPillows that disrupt snoring and sleep apnea\nSouth Korean company 10minds Co. encouraged conventioneers to throw away their standard pillows with the motion pillow and motion sleep products. The memory foam pillows address snoring and sleep apnea by rotating the head into a new position and helping improve airway obstruction. A system detects snoring sounds \u2013 and oxygen saturation levels in the motion sleep product for apnea patients \u2013 then pushes air through connected tubes and into seven airbags in the pillows. The consumer preventative motion pillow, without oxygen saturation detection, starts at $699.\nReview-Journal reporter Sean Hemmersmeier contributed to this report.\nMcKenna Ross is a corps member with Report for America, a national service program that places journalists into local newsrooms. Contact her at mross@reviewjournal.com. Follow @mckenna_ross_ on X.\nWu-Tang Clan at Voltaire at The Venetian was the most in-demand private concert during this year\u2019s annual CES convention.\nUnion workers have been fighting for months for stronger job protection against inevitable advancements in technology. Some of them were on display this week at CES.\nWalmart is incorporating artificial intelligence into the retail experience through new features introduced at CES, president and CEO Doug McMillon said during a Tuesday keynote address.\nA Las Vegas landmark has transformed into one of the most recognizable video games in the world during CES week.\nLas Vegas\u2019 convention outlook is bright in the new year.

The best of it aimed to solve big real-world problems. Some of it aimed to make your life more fun. And some of it was just a little out there.\nAssociated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.\nHere's what caught our eye at CES 2024.\nACCESSIBILITY PRODUCTS WERE BIG ON HOPE\nAt a conference where excess and opulence manifested itself in nearly everything, it was encouraging to see how much progress has been made toward developing assistive technologies for the disabled.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help Parkinson's patients and those with hand tremors regain control of their lives. Dutch startup Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI to give people with vocal impairments a chance to have real-time conversations in their own natural voices. OrCam introduced a host of devices designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. And Sony reserved some prime space in its booth to showcase its Access controller for PlayStation.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEARLY EVERYTHING\nUsing software and AI to achieve inter-device connections between smart devices, your home and even your car was central to many of the biggest tech companies at CES 2024.\nSamsung's new \"AI for all\" mantra meant integrating its smart home devices and appliances to perform tasks in unison\u2014like the act of recipe selection automatically pre-heating your oven. The South Korean tech giant also announced a collaboration with Hyundai to develop \"home-to-car\" and \"car-to-home\" services for all Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Google is expanding Chromecast to more apps and devices. And Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard to create more inter-operability between smart devices.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize interactions between drivers and their cars.\nVEHICLES ADVANCES WERE ON FULL DISPLAY\nCES 2024 was brimming with new electric vehicles, remote construction vehicles, hydrogen engines and other mobility advances.\nHonda premiered two concept cars, dubbed the \"Saloon\" and \"Space-Hub,\" for a new global EV series. Kia decided to go modular with a trio of electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to change their functionality. And Vietnam-based electric upstart VinFast unveiled an electric truck concept.\nBosch Mobility and Hyundai both doubled down on hydrogen as an energy solution. And Hyundai showcased its AI-based autonomous construction excavator.\nHOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don't need to cook\u2014or mix drinks\u2014for themselves anymore.\nGE wants you to start smoke food indoors, while generative AI is powering a Brisk smart grill that aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but ColdSnap's new ice cream machine prepares your frozen treat in two minutes. And Bartesian's cocktail-mixing appliance can make as many as 60 different kinds of drinks for you.\nMeanwhile, for much younger consumers (and their parents), Veba Baby's smart baby bottle monitor tracks the expiration of breast milk and formula. The product\u2014which also serves as a bottle locator\u2014monitors the temperature, when a baby feeds from the bottle, and more to detect freshness. And everything is logged onto an accompanying app.\nWHAT'S NEW ON TV?\nOLED, Micro LED, 8k ... what does it all mean? It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG's 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung's transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\n\u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
