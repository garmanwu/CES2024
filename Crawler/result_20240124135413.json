History of Honda: The origin and staring (\u201czero\u201d) point of Honda\nHonda will create a new point of origin for the next-generation of Honda by going back to the starting point of Honda, including the pursuit of the M/M concept, the joy of driving and the joy of the freedom of mobility, which Honda has always valued and will continue to pursue.\n2. Implementation of the Global Brand Slogan: Moving peoples\u2019 hearts with the value created from \u201czero\u201d\nUnder its global brand slogan \u201cThe Power of Dreams \u2013 How we move you,\u201d Honda will always be driven by \u201cdreams,\u201d and by creating new value through creative thinking from zero, Honda will provide experiences that will become a new starting point for our customers. This is how Honda will move people and their hearts.\n3. Initiatives to contribute to society: Determination to achieve \u201czero\u201d\nHonda is determined to achieve \u201czero environmental impact\u201d throughout the vehicle\u2019s life cycle, including corporate activities, and \u201czero traffic collision fatalities\u201d involving Honda motorcycles and automobiles.\n\u25a0\u201cThin, Light, and Wise\u201d \u2013 New approach to EV development and the five core values Honda EVs will offer\nIn developing the Honda 0 Series, the development team went back to the starting point of Honda and reconsidered what kind of EVs Honda wants to create in the coming era. \u00a0Honda will strive to create new value for EVs by transcending the constraints of being a \u201cthick and heavy\u201d vehicle due to an increase in battery capacity the vehicle has to carry to secure enough range, as well as a large body and platform necessary to accommodate such battery capacity. Honda describes this new approach to EV development as \u201cThin, Light, and Wise.\u201d\nThin:\nAugmenting design potential, including styling with a low vehicle height, and realizing excellent aerodynamic performance by utilizing a \u201cthin\u201d dedicated EV platform to create a low floor height.\nLight:\nRealizing sporty driving and electricity efficiency performance that defy the established beliefs people have about EVs through Honda original technologies created by going back to the starting point of Honda as an automaker.\nWise:\nRealizing Honda original software-defined mobility products by leveraging the knowledge Honda has amassed to date and by making cars wiser through the advancement of intelligent technologies.\nHonda EVs, which will be built based on this development approach and feature a dedicated EV architecture, will offer the following five core values:\n1) Artistic design that evokes resonance\n2) AD/ADAS that ensures safety and peace of mind\n3) A \u201cspace\u201d for people made possible by the internet of things and connected technologies\n4) The joy of driving with the feeling of oneness with the vehicle\n5) Outstanding electricity efficiency performance\n\u25a0Five core values\n1) Artistic design that evokes resonance:\nThe design concept is \u201cThe Art of Resonance.\u201d Under the theme of a \u201cresonance with the environment, society and users,\u201d Honda will offer sustainable mobility products that evoke resonance in people who see them and expand the possibilities of people\u2019s daily life.\n2) AD/ADAS that ensures safety and peace of mind:\nIn 2021, Honda put Level 3 automated driving into practical use by introducing the all-new Legend equipped with Honda SENSING Elite that includes an advanced technology qualifying for Level 3 automated driving (conditional automated driving in a limited area). In order to offer automated driving technologies Honda has amassed to more customers around the world, the Honda 0 Series will feature an ADAS (advanced driver-assistive system) that utilizes the technologies of Honda SENSING Elite.\nMoreover, in the second half of the 2020s, Honda 0 Series models will feature an AD (automated driving) system and will be offered as more affordable EVs featuring more automated driving functions.\nThis AD system is being developed based on Honda\u2019s \u201chuman-centric\u201d safety concept. It will feature further advanced AI, sensing, recognition/decision-making and driver monitoring technologies to realize more human-like, natural and high-precision risk predictions, making it possible to offer automated driving functions people can use safely and with peace of mind. Such advanced AD technologies will increase the number of situations where automated driving can be used on expressways and make some of hands-off functions, currently available only on expressways, available on regular roads.\n3) New value as a \u201cspace\u201d for people made possible by the internet of things (IoT) and connected technologies:\nThrough IoT and connected technologies centered on Honda\u2019s original vehicle OS, the Honda 0 Series models will aim to offer the value of \u201cfun to drive, fun to use and fun to be connected.\u201d With the utilization of AI and big data, the vehicle will learn the user\u2019s preferences such as music, as well as a driver\u2019s behaviors and tendencies while driving, and will make various suggestions. Moreover, the vehicle will provide information about the surrounding areas and route guidance for the \u201clast mile\u201d to the final destination that users have to travel on their own after getting off the vehicle. The vehicle will offer value as if it understands the feelings of the user. The more people use their vehicle, the closer they become with their vehicles, which makes it possible for the vehicle to offer the \u201cfun of being connected\u201d in various situations in people\u2019s daily lives.\n4) The joy of driving with the feeling of oneness with the vehicle\nWith Honda\u2019s original electrification and dynamics technologies, the Honda 0 Series models will offer the joy of driving for a new era, an uplifting feeling that comes from a sporty drive and sense of oneness the driver feels, both mentally and physically, with the vehicle. In addition, by combining the low-height styling of the 0 Series with a full range of aerodynamic technologies honed by Honda in motor sports, dynamic and aerodynamic performance and design will be harmonized at a high level.\n5) Outstanding electricity efficiency performance\nBased on the electrification technology Honda has amassed in the development of hybrid vehicles and other areas, energy efficiency is pursued to achieve high electricity efficiency performance.\u00a0In particular, Honda 0 Series models will feature e-Axles*2 with excellent power conversion efficiency and packaging, lightweight, high-density battery packs and excellent aerodynamic performance, targeting a sufficient range while minimizing the battery capacity loaded on the vehicle.\nMoreover, to address concerns about \u201ccharging time\u201d and \u201cbattery degradation,\u201d which have been the challenge facing the popularization of EVs, Honda 0 Series models will offer stress-free charging performance and worry-free battery performance that minimizes degradation over many years of use. For the 0 Series models to be launched in the second half of the 2020s, fast-charging 15% to 80% will be shortened to about 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, by applying battery system control technology refined based on a massive amount of driving data from over 1 million units of Honda electrified vehicles, Honda is striving to limit the degradation of battery capacity (range) to less than 10% after 10 years of use.\n*2\u00a0 A system that consists of a motor, inverter and gearbox, and converts electric power energy into driving force.\n\u25a0Concept models that represent the Honda 0 Series \u2013 Saloon and Space-Hub\nThe Saloon is the flagship concept model of the Honda 0 Series, which embodies the \u201cThin, Light, and Wise\u201d approach. The dedicated EV architecture extends the degree of freedom in design and elevates the M/M concept in the era of EVs. The low height, sporty styling that sets the Saloon apart from other EVs at first glance realizes both a fascinating design and an interior space that is more spacious than people can imagine based on the exterior appearance. Moreover, the instrument panel features a human-machine interface (HMI) that enables simple and intuitive operations, realizing a sophisticated and seamless user interface (UI). With an exhilarating visibility and intuitive UI, the Saloon strives to provide a fun driving experience that resonates with the driver\u2019s sensibility.\nWith the adoption of steer-by-wire and the further advancement of the motion management system, including posture control, that Honda has amassed through the development of original robotics technologies, the Saloon aims to realize control at the will of the driver in a variety of driving situations. As the flagship model of the Honda 0 Series, the Saloon pursues the ultimate \u201cjoy of driving\u201d in the EV era. Furthermore, including the use of sustainable materials for the interior and exterior, the Saloon is being developed as a unique model that resonates with users and the natural environment.\nSaloon concept movie\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87qnsLic5hw\nUnder the common design language of the Honda 0 Series, the Space-Hub was developed under the theme of \u201caugmenting people\u2019s daily lives.\u201d Realizing a spacious cabin and excellent visibility based on the \u201cThin, Light, and Wise\u201d development approach, the Space-Hub offers a flexible space that immediately accommodates what the users want to do, and becomes a hub that connects people to people and people to society, generating mutual resonance with each other.\nSpace-Hub concept movie\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIEUw_8l6QY\n\uff1cAbout new H mark\uff1e\nThe current \u201cH mark\u201d has a long history, dating back to 1981 when it was renewed from the previous version. To commemorate the development of the next-generation EVs, Honda decided to design a new H mark, which represents Honda automobiles, to express Honda\u2019s determination to pursue the transformation as well as Honda\u2019s corporate attitude of going beyond the origin of Honda and constantly pursuing new challenges and advancements. This design expression, like two outstretched hands, represents Honda\u2019s commitment to augment the possibilities of mobility and sincerely serve the needs of the users of Honda EVs. This new H mark will be used on next-generation EVs of Honda, including Honda 0 Series models.\nHonda press conference at CES 2024 (livestreaming/archive)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYdfi_zkQDQ\nDownload\nLink"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Honda Previews '0 Series' Concept EVs With 10-Minute Charging\nHonda's next EVs will debut in North America in 2026 with a new logo and improved battery. The concept vehicles inspiring the lineup, dubbed the Saloon and Space-Hub, are on display at CES.\nLAS VEGAS\u2014Honda showed off two concept vehicles here at CES as previews of its new lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the \"0 Series.\"\nOn display are the Saloon and Space-Hub concepts, the latter of which offers a living-room style interior. The first production vehicle will debut in North America in 2026, based off the Saloon concept. By the late-2020s, Honda says 0 Series EVs will have a lightweight, energy-dense battery that can fast-charge from 15% to 80% in 10-15 minutes.\nMost new EVs today take 30-45 minutes to fast-charge, so that would be quite an improvement, though Honda did not disclose the vehicles' future range. Honda also did not publish comparable charging specs for its first EV, the 2024 Prologue, beyond that it gets 65 miles of range in about 10 minutes of charging.\nBattery degradation is another focus for 0 Series EVs. The current EV standard is 20% degradation, but Honda is targeting less than 10% after 10 years of driving.\n\"Our goal is to prolong battery life,\" says Honda, by using the \"vast amount of data Honda has accumulated on its [hybrid electric] models to diagnose battery conditions with high precision\" and adjust to driving conditions.\nHonda did not provide further details on the battery technology, but told PCMag they will be produced in Ohio through Honda's joint venture factory with LG and will comply with requirements for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\u00a0The batteries are expected to be smaller, though, while the cars will feature more lightweight \"e-Axles,\" meaning the vehicles themselves also won't be as heavy.\n\u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d says Toshihiro Mibe, global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light, and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nRecommended by Our Editors\nDesign-wise, the EVs aim to be \"overwhelmingly different\" at first glance with \"bold\" proportions.\nFinally, Honda introduced a new logo for all of its upcoming EVs, the first major logo change since 1981. \"This new design expression, which symbolizes two outstretched hands, represents Honda\u2019s commitment to expand the possibilities of mobility and continue to meet the needs of its customers,\" Honda says.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best EV and car tech of CES 2024: from Honda, BMW, Mercedes and more\nCES 2024 was big for EV and automative innovation\nCars are rapidly becoming an extension of our digital lives \u2013\u00a0and this week's CES 2024 showed how much the two will continue to intertwine this year and beyond.\nWhether it's accessing your calendar on the move or controlling your smart home kit with your voice, cars are increasingly becoming giant smartphones. Add a push towards alternative fuel sources, be it electricity or hydrogen, into the mix, and you can see why the Consumer Electronics Show is becoming a favorite spot for automakers to reveal their latest innovations.\nThis year saw just a handful of new vehicle concepts unveiled, chiefly Honda\u2019s re-writing of its own EV rulebook and Kia\u2019s push into commercial vehicles. But AI assistants and advanced infotainment offerings were arguably the show\u2019s core theme in 2024.\nLuckily for you, we sweatily shuffled over 40km in three days to get hands-on with the most important EV and in-car tech reveals of CES 2024...\n1. Honda resets the EV clock to zero\nHonda's journey towards electrification hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. But at CES 2024, the Japanese company said it wants to remedy that by going back to \"the starting point of Honda as an automaker\". Essentially, it is ripping up its own rulebook and starting afresh.\nThe result is two stunning concepts, the 0 Series Saloon and Space-hub, both offering a glimpse at Honda\u2019s overarching design direction and EV philosophy.\nGlobal CEO Toshihiro Mibe says his company wants to move away from the \"thick and heavy\" electric cars of today and instead focus on a \"thin, light and wise\" philosophy.\nCut through the non-speak and Honda is looking towards the next generation of thinner and lighter battery packs to power its sleek, low and rakish Saloon, which is tipped to be very close to a production version and is promised to inherit the marque\u2019s 'joy of driving' spirit.\nThere\u2019s no word on range and performance, as it\u2019s likely still hypothetical, but both the Saloon and the people moving, lounge-like Space-Hub will both feature advanced driver assist systems, high levels of autonomous driving capabilities and, fingers crossed, some cutting-edge infotainment thanks to Honda\u2019s close ties with multimedia and entertainment giant Sony.\n2. BMW showcases AR driving\nBMW hosted demos of an Xreal Air 2-based augmented reality experience aboard a BMW iX at CES 2024 \u2013\u00a0and TechRadar\u2019s US Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff said that what he saw \"surprised and often delighted\" him.\nThat\u2019s high praise indeed, but rather than merely being a fun gimmick (BMW made it rain AR casino betting chips on our cruise around Las Vegas), it could also be a very handy extension of the navigation and infotainment system in general.\nWith the Xreal Air 2 glasses on, BMW is able to project driver information onto the real world outside the windscreen, with strobing 3D green arrows highlighting upcoming turns, and large red blocks warning when the driver is getting dangerously close to static objects.\nCurrently, the system is running through a smartphone that is connected to the car, but developers behind the tech want to make the entire experience wireless, opening it up to other brands of augmented reality glasses to make the experience as seamless as possible for potential customers.\nBut the ultimate party piece? Flip down the front sun visor and the system becomes an impressively sharp\u00a0private cinema. Perfect for whiling away the hours when charging modern EVs on a cripplingly slow public charging network.\n3. Kia pushes into electric vans\nKia's interpretation of PBV stands for \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicles\u2019, rather than the more commonly used 'purpose built vehicles', but either way this is its break into the electric commercial vehicle market.\nThe upcoming line-up comprises the PV1, PV5 and PV7, which showcase a range of sizes and applications, and span ideas that are very close to production, as well as those that are little more future-thinking.\nThe mid-sized PV5 is our best indication of what Kia\u2019s electric van will look like and its highly modular interior can be configured for a range of scenarios, be it last mile delivery or transporting the family in a ride-hailing service.\nOne of its key USPs is its software defined nature, which allows it to pass data from a central control room to the vehicle and vice versa, making it simple for operators to manage an entire fleet in real time, without the need for additional technology.\nAs we look into the future-gazing crystal ball, we will see fully autonomous versions and what Kia is calling 'Easy Swap' technology, which allows a single vehicle chassis to house multiple upper bodies, effectively transforming it from a cargo carrier to mobile office (and beyond) in minutes thanks to hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling tech.\n4. Mercedes reinvents your driving playlist\nIt was the CES innovation I really wanted to hate, but ended up becoming slightly smitten with, as Mercedes-Benz effectively turned its electric vehicles into musical instruments.\nThanks to Will.i.am and his team of talented developers, the Mercedes-Benz MBUX Sound Drive app deconstructs your favourite tracks and uses information from the vehicle, such as steering inputs, acceleration and braking, to create intriguing, live performance style remixes.\nYou can read our full hands-on MBUX experience for more details, but a quick test of the technology proved it was less a gimmicky way to kill a few minutes, and more a clever way to uniquely soundtrack an audibly-bereft electric vehicle. Hey, I don\u2019t even like The Black Eyed Peas, but MBUX Sound Drive made me reconsider my position.\n5. Harman turns car seats into speakers\nDubbed SeatSonic, Harman\u2019s passenger-centric audio system completely rethinks the in-car listening experience, with one Harman executive going so far as saying it also \"frees car designers from today\u2019s interior constraints\".\nWe\u2019re not sure how much design real estate is actually behind a door card, but the idea is solid, as it sees near-field transducers integrated into the headrests and a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seats for a viscerally bassy experience.\nThe sound quality is great, although the basic package, where speakers are only installed in the seats, can sound a little dull and distant. To combat this, Harman will offer additional tweeters that nestle beneath the windscreen for a much richer listen.\nBetter still, Harman says that because the audio doesn\u2019t have to travel as far, there is a 60 per cent power saving when compared to a conventional in-car audio set-up. That stuff makes a big difference in today\u2019s world of electric vehicles and range anxiety.\nHarman has been working with seat makers, as well as Tier 1 suppliers that produce automotive grade ventilation, heating and massaging tech, to integrate it into one neat, ready to rock package. So expect to see it go live soon.\n6. Mobion banishes awkward parking situations\nStick with us here, as this one gets a little weird. But Hyundai Mobis, a subsidiary of automotive giant Hyundai, offered a glimpse of a future where tricky parking situations are no more. The Mobion concept car, which is just a jazzy Hyundai Ioniq 5, features the company\u2019s In-Wheel motor technology and upcoming e-Corner drive system.\nHere, all four wheels are driven and can steer independently of one another. Motors in the wheels mean no axles, which frees up each corner to do as it pleases. Well, within reason.\nA live demonstration showed how Mobion can \u2018crab-walk\u2019, where all four wheels rotate 90-degrees and the car effectively performs a sideways scuttle into tough parallel parking spots. The system can move the car diagonally, back and forth, as well as see it rotate a full 360 degrees around its centre axis \u2013 it puts our U-turns to shame.\nNaturally, everything is overseen by Lidar, radar and high-definition cameras, which allows most manoeuvers to be performed autonomously, while exterior projection lighting allows the car to project safety information around it as it performs its party tricks \u2013 seemingly so pedestrians don\u2019t completely freak out.\nThe In-Wheel motor and e-Corner system are \"ready for immediate mass production,\" according to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. The company just needs to find a suitable Hyundai or Kia product to place it in.\n7. Mullen goes supersonic with its 1,000bhp Five RS\nCalifornian EV maker Mullen took the wraps off potentially one of the most aggressive and utterly banzai electric SUVs were have ever laid eyes on. The performance figures hurt just to look at: 1,000bhp, 0-60mph in under two seconds and a top speed in excess of 200mph.\nAll that, and Mullen says it will feature a two-speed transmission, an 800V electrical architecture for faster charging and offer over 300 miles of real-world range. Race-derived Brembo braking products, bucket seats, and an overtly aggressive stance all come as standard.\nBut because this is a modern EV, it also features an enormous dual screen infotainment set-up that is reported to come complete with a built-in voice assistant.\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Five RS is slated to go on sale in Europe in 2025, with a US version following in 2027. Prices are due to start at an eye-watering $295,000 / \u00a3231,000 / \u20ac268,000 / AUS$441,000.\n8. Hyundai takes to the skies\nIn a purpose-built 'vertiport' outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Hyundai\u2019s Supernal S-A2, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) craft that is set to begin testing next year. Designed by Hyundai\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke, the man behind the stunning N Vision 74 (and many others), it takes styling inspiration from the eyes of a bee and features a highly configurable, premium interior that can seat up to four passengers.\nUsing eight tilting rotors, it can fly at speeds of up to 120mph, while the on-board high density battery packs are good for trips ranging from 25 to 40 miles \u2013 although that will increase. The idea is that the craft operates at 1,500ft, way below commercial aircraft, and offers short hops between inner city \u2018vertiports\u2019 using an Uber-style ride hailing platform.\nHead of the project and ex-NASA man Jaiwon Shin, says quietness is key, stating that the S-A2 emits just 65db during take-off and around 45db during cruise, which he says his less than a domestic dishwasher. He wants to avoid people \"looking up\" when it is in operation and hopes it will \"blend into inner-city traffic noise\".\nThe eVTOL craft has 'upgrade-ability' baked into it, meaning the S-A2 is ready to accept the next generation of battery technology. Supernal says it is moving beyond an early technology demonstrator and will begin testing the S-A2 you see before you in 2025.\n9. XPeng reveals pre-order plan for its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nIf XPeng is the Chinese manufacturer of impressive and altogether highly competitive electric cars, XPeng AeroHT is its slightly bonkers, future-thinking little brother. A sibling that comes up with flying car concepts and six-wheeled off-road MPVs that come complete with a human piloted electric 'Air Module' in the back.\n\"I like flying, I have a helicopter, but I can\u2019t take the helicopter where I want. If I have this car, I can drive to where I want, park up and go flying,\" XPeng AeroHT\u2019s co-founder and vice president, Tan Wang told me at CES this year. \"The car is for customers that like to go off-road, but the performance on the road is way better, because it has three motors, one on each axle\" he added.\nIn addition to this, Wang claims the Air Module is much simpler to operate than a standard helicopter, as it blends human piloting skills with advanced levels of autonomy. Because of this, Wang feels it will require much fewer than 40 flying hours to obtain a helicopter license to legally be able to operate the eVTOL craft.\nWang also went on record to say the company was accepting pre-orders as of the end of this year, and that he hoped to have product in the air by the end of 2025. Both the six-wheeled vehicle and the aircraft can be yours for $200,000 /\u00a3157,000 /\u20ac182,000 / AUS$298,000, which feels like a bit of a bargain to us.\nHowever, Wang also pointed out that his company was \"still in the process\" of obtaining certification from the Chinese Aviation Authority, but he was hopeful it would happen soon.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest\u00a0CES news\u00a0from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Honda Debuts Funky New EV Concepts at CES 2024\nAt CES this week, Honda debuted two new electric concepts. One, an eye-catching electric \u201cSaloon,\u201d previews an electric sedan coming in 2026. The other, an electric van dubbed the \u201cSpace-Hub,\u201d is far from a certainty in the North American market. Regardless, both preview the design language that can be expected from Honda going forward, as well as introducing a new Honda logo for the brand\u2019s upcoming efforts.\nThe Honda Saloon concept is a look at a totally new lineup of EVs, and it certainly features the trappings of the next generation of EVs. The brand says that the interior makes use of sustainable materials, steer-by-wire technology, and new body control systems that promise to make driving EVs fun. Meanwhile, the Space-Hub is designed to be just that- a hub that will connect \u201cpeople to each other and the outside world.\u201d The concept is designed to carry plenty of people in plenty of comfort, and in a unique way, thanks to its roundtable-style seating layout.\nBoth the Saloon and the Space-Hub are part of Honda\u2019s new 0 Series range of cars. The two are a mere starting point, and Honda says that each new 0 Series product will adhere to three main principles: \u201cThin, Light, and Wise.\u201d 0 Series models will have thinner batteries, a lower floor, a heavy focus on sustainable materials use, and much-improved driver assistance features. Honda\u2019s current crop of ADAS are far from bad, but the brand isn\u2019t exactly at the forefront of driver assistance technology, either. Little other information on the upcoming 0 Series lineup is available now, but the brand did let slip that its new batteries will charge from 15%-80% capacity in around 10-15 minutes, which is largely on par with that of many other brands using 800-volt architecture, like Kia and Hyundai. The concepts preview a seismic shift at Honda and one that looks set to start in 2026 with the arrival of the production version of the Saloon concept.\nBecome an AutoGuide insider.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: 5 car trends we're expecting to see\nCES, perhaps the premier conference for new tech, has become a major conference for news in the car industry. The 2024 version of the conference should prove to keep that trend. As TechCrunch noted \"a big part of CES\u2019s evolution over the past few years has been its positioning as a major automotive show,\" since carmakers have leaned into tech features.\nThe massive Vegas event is scheduled to take place Jan. 9-12. The car news you can expect this year? Well, first and foremost things are going to get even more electric. Let's get into it.\n1. Electrified not automated\nThe market has been rough on autonomous vehicles while EVs are growing ever more popular. Tech Radar predicted that CES 2024 will focus heavily on electric cars while eschewing automation, especially considering auto giant Ford announced last year that it would move away from fully autonomous tech. Both Ford and GM took huge losses on automated tech. EV sales, meanwhile, grew from some 3 million in 2020 to more than 10 million in 2023, Tech Radar noted. The market has spoken and CES 2024 will likely reflect that fact.\n2. Tech you can actually use\nCar companies love announcing things that are way down the road. How often have you seen, for instance, a \"concept\" car that never becomes a reality? Last year at CES, for instance, BMW announced a color-changing concept car that hasn't hit the streets.\nThat might not be the case in 2024, however. In that same article, Tech Radar's Jeremy Kaplan predicted \"There will be tons of real-world tech on display at CES 2024, actual stuff you can actually buy today for your next actual car.\"\n3. Honda has new EVs coming\nKeeping on theme, Honda reportedly plans to drop new EVs at CES. The Japanese car giant announced it'll debut its new \"global EV series models and several key technologies that illustrate the significant transformation Honda is currently undergoing.\" Details are scarce but it's safe to assume the announcement on Tuesday, Jan. 9 will be a big one.\n4. Concept cars...yes, still\nListen...you might get more tech you can actually use but carmakers still love to make concept vehicles. We've already gotten a peek at one. Hyundai already dropped a preview of its Mobion concept car, which allows all its wheels to turn independently and will debut at CES 2024.\n5. Not too much AI\nWhile CES 2024 might have an AI focus overall, the car industry might be an exception to that rule. After all, you can't risk unreliable tech \u2014 which AI is, thus far \u2014 in something as dangerous as a car. Don't expect AI-powered vehicles just yet. \"Experts predict companies will showcase automotive AI in lower-stakes applications such as vehicle personalization,\" wrote Automotive News.\nTopics\nCars\nTim Marcin is a culture reporter at Mashable, where he writes about food, fitness, weird stuff on the internet, and, well, just about anything else. You can find him posting endlessly about Buffalo wings on Twitter at @timmarcin."

        "raw_content": "ABC News\nVideo\nLive\nShows\nElection 2024\n538\nStream on\nEdmunds highlights top car-tech trends from CES 2024\nCES in Las Vegas gives us a glimpse of where automakers believe vehicles are headed in the future\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nTop Stories\nConcertgoers sue Madonna over show starting late\nLos Angeles Innocence Project takes up case of notorious killer Scott Peterson\nHBCU administrator's death by suicide prompts calls for president's resignation\nKidnapping of California woman that police called a hoax gets new attention with Netflix documentary\n15 students and 1 teacher drown when a boat capsizes in a lake in western India\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
