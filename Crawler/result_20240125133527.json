        "raw_content": "How-To Geek\nPowering Up: Bluetti\u2019s Groundbreaking Energy Solutions Take CES 2024 by Storm\nThis post is sponsored by BLUETTI.\nBLUETTI, a trailblazer in portable power solutions, is set to captivate audiences at CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 9th to 12th.\nThis year, the company promises not only to showcase its established power stations but also unveil two groundbreaking innovations poised to redefine outdoor power solutions in the first quarter of 2024: the BLUETTI SwapSolar and the AC240.\nBluetti SwapSolar: Revolutionizing Portable Power for Adventure Seekers\nOne of the standout products in BLUETTI's CES lineup is the SwapSolar, a fusion of the AC180T portable generator and the BLUETTI MultiCooler portable refrigerator.

        "raw_content": "BLUETTI\u2019s wide catalog of Power Stations at CES 2024 make it an Absolute Must-Have for 2024\nAs the tech world descended upon Las Vegas for CES 2024, BLUETTI, a name synonymous with portable power solutions, has once again set the gold standard with its latest offerings designed for recreation, emergencies, work, and overall energy independence. From the versatile SwapSolar system to the rugged AC240 power station, BLUETTI\u2019s lineup this year is nothing short of a power-packed promise for both adventurers and home users. We visited the BLUETTI booth to speak to their Director of Portable Power Systems, Phillip Fischer. Phillip explained to us what BLUETTI\u2019s been achieving in the past year, what are the new exciting products they\u2019re debuting at CES, and why portable power stations should be on everyone\u2019s wishlist for 2024.\nDesigner: BLUETTI\nIf you\u2019re still one of those power-station skeptics in the year 2024, Phillip has some rather sage advice to give you. Sure, the average power station user is the outdoorsy type, using it to provide energy to camping sites, RVs, and other outdoor excursions/activities\u2026 but what BLUETTI\u2019s power stations also do is provide aid and assistance during emergency power cuts. Whether it\u2019s one of their larger devices, or even the small portable ones, BLUETTI\u2019s power stations can be potential life-savers when the power runs out. The same power station can play multiple roles, whether it\u2019s necessity or leisure\u2026 with the added benefit of helping you do things like shift to a solar grid too to help reduce power bills.\nLeading the power-station charge at CES this year is the BLUETTI SwapSolar, a dynamic duo comprising the AC180T portable generator and the MultiCooler portable fridge. The AC180T can easily be confused for its sibling, the AC180 \u2013 but what really sets it apart is its game-changing hot-swappable battery system. With 1,433Wh capacity, 1,800W output, and 2,700W lifting power, the AC180T features two detachable batteries that can either be used simultaneously, or in a scenario where one battery is removed from the AC180T and placed in the MultiCooler portable fridge. Imagine never running out of power because you can instantly replace depleted batteries with charged ones.\nBut that\u2019s not all. The MultiCooler is the Swiss Army knife of portable fridges. Acting as a fridge, freezer, and, believe it or not, an ice maker, it redefines the concept of portable cooling. Featuring a 40-liter compartment with temperature control from -20\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F), the MultiCooler can chill a staggering 65 cans of soda (or any beverage of your choosing) or keep the sausages frozen for a picnic. It also boasts the ability to make ice from moving water, a feature that Phillip mentioned was \u201creally cool\u201d (pun intended!)\nNext up, meet the AC240, BLUETTI\u2019s rugged outdoor companion following the legacy of the AC60. Tailor-made for the wild, this power station is both water-resistant and dust-proof, boasting an impressive IP65 rating. Whether you\u2019re facing a dust storm in the desert or a downpour in the mountains, the AC240 won\u2019t let you down. With a robust 2400W of power output and a 1536Wh LFP battery, it\u2019s built to last. And if you thought that was impressive, the AC240 can expand its capacity to a whopping 10kWh with four B210 expansion batteries. BLUETTI didn\u2019t stop there. They also showcased their revamped portable generators and home storage products, including the AC60P, AC2P, and the modular AC500 and AC300 series.\nIn the midst of unveiling these technological marvels, BLUETTI also took a moment to highlight its Lighting an African Family (LAAF) program. This initiative underscores BLUETTI\u2019s commitment to social responsibility, bringing sustainable solar energy to African families. With over 100,000 families already impacted, BLUETTI is powering more than devices; it\u2019s powering dreams.\nRelated Posts\nThinking of buying the Galaxy S24?

        "raw_content": "BLUETTI Embraces Flexibility With New Battery Swapping & Expandable Power Stations At CES 2024\nBLUETTI continues to build on its core competency of building batteries in 2024 with a host of new product introductions at CES in Las Vegas. CleanTechnica sat down with BLUETTI\u2019s Sales Director Brian Shircliffe, who unpacked the new products for us and explained a bit more about where the company is going in the future.\nBLUETTI has filled out its portable power station product lineup over the last few years and at RE+ last year, moved into the home energy storage space. At CES this year, BLUETTI is expanding even further, adding flexible storage to its products and increasing their capability on the solar side of things.\nSwapsolar\nBLUETTI introduced an entirely new family of products at CES this year that utilize its new Swapsolar technology. As the name implies, Swapsolar enables you to swap the power stored up from solar panels in a portable power station into a host of other devices.\nAt launch, BLUETTI is rolling out Swapsolar in the new AC180T portable power station and their new Multicooler portable refrigerator freezer combination. Both of these devices make use of BLUETTI LFP chemistry which is extremely stable and enables it to be used for far more cycles. This makes it perfect for applications where the batteries are being cycled a lot, even up to daily use.\nThe individual battery packs themselves have a capacity of 717 watt hours. The AC 180T can hold two of these batteries while the multi-cooler runs on a single battery pack.\nThe ability to charge up batteries separate from the place where you\u2019re using them means you can bring extra individual battery packs for all your devices, bring whatever devices your current adventure requires, and always have the right amount of power needed where you need it, when you need it. Flexibility is key and this level of flexibility from a big player in the space is something we have not seen before.\nThis functionality is currently only available in the AC180T and Multicooler, but we expect BLUETTI to flesh out its product line with even more Swapsolar-enabled products in the future. It just makes sense and offers a ton of extra value to customers.\nAC240\nAt CES this year, BLUETTI also introduced the IP65-rated, water and dust resistant AC240 portable power station. It\u2019s an expandable portable power station that allows you to upgrade the total storage capacity up to 10.1 kWh by adding up to 4 of BLUETTI\u2019s B210 expansion batteries to it.\nOn the technical side of things, the AC240 also offers some top of class numbers. It can push out up to 2,400 watts of power continuously or 3,000 watts peak which should handle just about anything you can throw at inside the home or out.\nIf you do need more power, you can actually bundle two of the AC 240 units for a total output capacity of an impressive 4,800 watts continuous and a total storage capacity of 20.2 kWh. That\u2019s a really neat trick we haven\u2019t seen before from any other manufacturer and makes it a solution for even more situations.\nOf course, with that much energy storage, you\u2019re not going to want to be lugging this thing around. It\u2019s optimized for use in stationary situations like at home in your garage, in the back of an RV or trailer, or in a permanent installation in an overlanding rig or expedition vehicle.\nThe AC240 can support up to 3500 charges in its lifecycle, meaning you could charge it just about every day for 10 years and still be sure to store more than the guaranteed capacity. Running in parallel to its expected long life, it comes with a 6-year warranty so you can use it for years with the knowledge that it\u2019s supported and backed by the BLUETTI brand.\nOverall\nThese new systems offer a unique value proposition with their new LFP-based battery swapping capability. They would be right at home in any family\u2019s camping kit or on the back of an overlanding rig.\nThey complement and already robust product portfolio including BLUETTI\u2019s stationary storage products like the AC500, AC300, EP900 and EP800.\nFor more information about BLUETTI\u2019s products from CES, head over to their website.\nThis article is sponsored by BLUETTI.\nShare this story!\nI'm a tech geek passionately in search of actionable ways to reduce the negative impact my life has on the planet, save money and reduce stress.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nSponsored Content\nGo wild with Bluetti with the debut of industry-first power solutions at CES 2024\nVisit Bluetti at CES 2024.\nThe 2024 Consumer Electronics Show is underway between January 9th and 12th in Las Vegas, and Bluetti, a world leader in portable power station solutions, is showing off its lineup of innovative products.\nWhile the current slate of power stations is formidable, Bluetti is releasing two breakthrough products for extreme outdoor needs: the SwapSolar power combo and AC240. These industry-changing products unlock an exciting world of powered outdoor activities, and you can catch your first glimpse in person at the Bluetti booth at CES 2024.\nBluetti SwapSolar: the ultimate all-in-one off-grid power solution\nBluetti's new SwapSolar is a revolutionary outdoor adventure companion that takes the popular AC180T portable power station and pairs it with a Bluetti MultiCooler portable refrigerator. This combination supports the swapping of batters to extend the capabilities of each device.\nThe AC180T is a capable device in its own right, with 1,433Wh of capacity, 1,800W output, and 2,700W lifting power. However, users can leverage the battery swap feature to remove two 716.8Wh battery packs for constant, instant, and reliable electricity on-demand.\nAs a comprehensive unit, the AC180T can function with both battery packs installed or with one pulling solo duty. That adaptability frees up the second battery to run the second component of this duo\u2014 the Bluetti MultiCooler.\nAlthough the AC180T is a captivating platform, the Bluetti MultiCooler portable refrigerator is the real show-stopper. Its first accolade is that it's the world's first LFP-powered 3-in-1 portable fridge that takes the ice chest concept to a futuristic level.\nThe 3-in-1 functions cover everything you need for cold food storage, including the fridge, freezer, and even ice maker. It has a massive 40-liter capacity, which is the perfect size for moderate off-grid excursions lasting upwards of a week.\nFurther adding to the futuristic abilities is the wide temperature range users can control, which extends from as cold as -4*F - 68*F (-20*C - 20*C). This broad temperature range means you can cook with five-star ingredients during your next wilderness escape by keeping food cold.\nThat five-star dinner wouldn't be so elevated without ice for your favorite beverages, and the Bluetti MultiCooler ice-making proficiency will fill your glass in minutes. The MultiCooler accomplishes that feat by using advanced moving water technology not found in any other cooler.\nYou can ensure your food and drinks remain at the perfect temp with confidence, knowing you have several power options, including your car outlet with or without the AC180T's battery. Likewise, the fridge can run on solar panels or standard wall plugs.\nVisitors to CES 2024 can experience SolarSwap firsthand at the Bluetti exhibition, and early adopters can secure one from the Indigogo crowdfunding. Buyers can expect SolarSwap to ship in February, which is plenty of time before spring adventures.\nBluetti AC240 is the latest model with a robust weather-resistant rating\nOutdoor adventures mean encountering harsh conditions that demand rugged equipment designed to withstand the elements. Bluetti launched the AC60 portable power station to meet the challenges of outdoor lifestyles, but they are upping the ante with the new AC240, featuring up to 2,400W of power delivery.\nThe AC240 has the same IP65 water and dust-resistant rating found on the AC60, but with a massive 1,536Wh capacity, it's able to energize anything in your RV or boat. You can bring all your creature comforts, including coffee makers, heaters, and portable fridges, on even the longest excursions.\nCharging the AC240 is rapid, with a charge time of only 70 minutes when using a 2,400W input. Or, you can use your off-grid Bluetti solar panels to provide charging in two hours with a 1,200W input.\nTo extend your getaways even longer, you can pair the AC240 with a B210 expansion battery to add an additional 2,150Wh of capacity. The B210 is also water-resistant, and linking up to four of these expansion batteries delivers more than 10,000Wh of capacity for authentic off-grid living.\nAdventurers are not the only beneficiaries of the AC240's flexibility, as Bluetti designed it to integrate into a web of backup power storage. That web can include up to two AC240s and eight B210 expansion batteries for a mind-numbing 20,000Wh.\nWhen used as a backup system, the AC240 can snap into action in as little as 15ms, thanks to the UPS. You'll never have to worry about electricity-dependant appliances again with the reliable power solutions showcased at CES 2024.\nThe AC240 portable power station launches this April on the Bluetti Amazon storefront. Keep an eye out for early-bird pricing coming soon.\nCatch the diverse range of Bluetti power station solutions on display at CES 2024\nVisitors to CES 2024 can experience a wide range of Bluetti power solutions on display through the exhibition. Be sure to check out some of these popular items you can explore:\nBluetti's commitment to reliable energy for all is on display at CES 2024\nBluetti is showcasing reliable energy-providing solutions through its lineup of robust portable and home backup power solutions. These products on display include the AC240 and SwapSolar newcomers, along with several other popular units.\nThese solutions provide clean, stable, and consistent electricity to power everything from cabin escapes and fishing trips to storm-resistant backup assurance. Plus, users can feel a sense of pride when using Bluetti's products as the company commits to bringing this much-needed resource to the most impoverished places.\nBluetti highlights that commitment through the Lighting an African Family (LAAF) program designed to provide free solar power to the darkest regions of the map. To date, the program serves more than 100,000 families across Nigeria, Kenya, and Cameroon.\nDon't miss Bluetti at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "We explain and teach technology, solve tech problems and help you make gadget buying decisions.\nPromoted\nCES 2024: BLUETTI Unveils Industry-First Power Solutions\nPromoted: This is a sponsored post on which the Bluetti and Guiding Tech Editorial teams worked together.\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, or CES 2024, will be a busy and exciting affair with several innovative announcements from tech giants like BLUETTI. For those unaware, BLUETTI has an exhaustive portfolio of noiseless power generators and solar panels, and the company will be showcasing a range of new products at CES 2024. This includes a 3-in-1 car fridge and an industry-first water-resistant power generator, among others.\nThe company will take the stage between January\u00a0 9th and 12th to unveil its latest portfolio. So, without further ado, let\u2019s check some of the innovative power solutions from BLUETTI during CES 2024.\nVisit BLUETTI\n1. BLUETTI Swapsolar: AC180T + MultiCooler Car Fridge\nThe BLUETTI Swapsolar combines two products \u2014 the AC180T portable generator and the MultiCooler car fridge. Both products ensure that you can get the most out of your car and camping trips. More to the point, the BLUETTI AC180T bundles several exciting features. It has a capacity of 1,433Wh, can output 1,800W, and lift up to 2,700W.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there. This power generator also bundles a hot-swappable battery design, wherein you can swap out one of the batteries. This technology ultimately means you will never be without power. For the record, a single battery has a capacity of 716.8Wh. While both batteries are needed for optimal power, you can also use one of the batteries to fuel the BLUETTI MultiCooler.\nThe Multicolor is a 3-in-1 portable fridge that can double as a freezer, ice maker (yes, you read that right!), and a fridge. So, depending on the purpose of your trip, you can customize its functions as per your requirements. Interestingly, it\u2019s cordless. It bundles two compartments, each with its temperature setting, giving you finer control over storing your food. The BLUETTI MultiCooler can also generate instant ice chips on particularly hot summer days.\nThe BLUETTI MultiCooler produces ice through moving water. This ensures that you get your share of ice chips within minutes. Besides charging via the AC180T\u2019s battery, the BLUETTI MultiCooler also supports car charging, wall outlets, and solar panels. With two full batteries, it can provide up to six days of usage. When you are done, you can use the quick drain feature in the ice maker to prevent mold and bacteria growth.\nThe BLUETTI SwapSolar combo will be launched in February 2024. The fridge comes with a two-year warranty, while the AC180T has a five-year warranty.\n2. BLUETTI AC240 Power Station\nOne of the key highlights of the BLUETTI AC240 power station is its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. To that end, the AC240 is a weatherproof power station that is IP65-rated for water and dust protection, making it perfect for stationing outdoors or for a day out on the beach, boat, or desert. And that\u2019s not all.\nFor one, the BLUETTI AC240 provides 2,400W and can supply adequate power to run RV essentials like heaters, fridges, microwaves, window ACs, and even coffee makers. If we talk numbers, the 1,536Wh LFP battery can run a 566-liter modern fridge for a day.\nLike most BLUETTI power stations, it has a modular design. For example, it pairs well with the B210 expansion battery unit. A single unit can add up to 2,150Wh. When paired with four battery units, it reaches a capacity of 10kWh.\nFurthermore, you can combine two AC240 units and drive the total output to 4,800W at 120V. Needless to say, the 20kWh capacity gives you enough wriggle room to power your home appliances and gadgets during power outages. It\u2019s worth noting that the UPS function kicks in immediately (15ms) during outages, and as such, the AC240 Power Station doubles up as a reliable power backup solution for residences.\nCharging the BLUETTI AC240 is quite simple and straightforward. In fact, the device will fast charge in 70 minutes when connected to the main power (max 2,400W). It also supports solar charging and takes around two hours on a 1,200W solar charge.\nThe BLUETII AC240 will go on sale on the BLUETTI official website and Amazon on 2nd April, 2024.\n3. BLUETTI AC500 Home Battery Backup\nAnother power station that BLUETTI will be showcasing this year at CES is the AC500 power generator. It has a power capacity of 5,000W. Like most BLUETTI generators, it also has a modular design. This means you can drive up the cumulative power by connecting it with battery packs like the B300 and B300S. Naturally, this gives it enough power to run household essentials like laptops, coffee machines, and ovens. For now, it supports up to six B300 power packs.\nLike the AC240, the AC500 also doubles as a UPS, and you can easily ride out power outages and voltage fluctuations. It\u2019s worth noting that you can drive up the total power output further by connecting two AC500 power stations in series via a Fusion Box Pro (sold separately).\nBLUETTI AC500 Home Battery Backup\nView\nIt also supports a bevy of charging mechanisms, including conventional AC charging and Lead-Acid battery charging. Last but not least, it has a slurry of ports and can be controlled remotely.\n4. BLUETTI AC300 Home Battery Backup\nThe BLUETTI AC300 is a powerful power backup solution. It is powerful (3,072Wh) enough to run household essentials like fridges, ovens, and ACs during power or grid failure. For example, a fully charged AC300 can juice an 800W refrigerator for three hours. And the fact that it also charges via solar panels is the cherry on top. It allows you to use clean energy to run your house instead of relying only on fossil fuels.\nThe BLUETTI AC300 also supports a modular design that gels well with a B300 modular battery pack. A single AC300 supports up to four B300 batteries, which drive up its capacity to 12,288Wh. Additionally, the AC300 is rapid, and it can restore power within 20 milliseconds of power failure.\nBLUETTI AC300 Home Battery Backup\nView\n5. BLUETTI EP900 Energy Storage System\nOne of the major highlights of the BLUETTI EP900 ESS is that it is a solar energy reservoir. Unlike some solar energy-based power generators, the EP900 ESS doesn\u2019t lose energy as soon as the sun sets. Instead, the B500 expansion battery units can store the excess energy, ensuring you can readily access this sustainable form of energy. Plus, it is a beefy power solution that has a continuous output of 9kW which can go up to 39kWh.\nAs mentioned earlier, the BLUETTI EP900 can be paired with up to four B500 expansion battery packs to provide additional power. The Energy Storage System is also compact and weatherproof, making it suitable for indoor and outdoor use. It has an IP65 rating, which means it is resistant to dust and water.\nBLUETTI EP900 Energy Storage System\nView\n6. EP800 Home Battery Backup\nAnother product showcased at CES 2024 is the BLUETTI EP800. This off-grid energy storage system can deliver up to 7,600W of power. The key highlight is that it can be integrated with both old and new solar panels and solar systems. Correspondingly, you can save money by using AC coupling and integrating it with existing solar systems (if any).\nThe EP800 is an efficient home backup power solution, and the device kicks in within 20ms. Plus, the 9.9kWh capacity can provide enough juice to run home essentials. As you may have guessed, it supports up to four modular battery packs like the B500 prefaced above.\nEP800 Home Battery Backup\nView\nHello, Power\nThese were some of the products that BLUETTI will showcase at CES 2024. Apart from the above, the company has a range of products designed for off-grid living and RV adventure seekers. Interested buyers can check out the aforementioned products and more in Booth #LVCC-North Hall 9645 at the Las Vegas Convention Center between January 9th and 12th.\nWritten By\nMultiple authors in the Guiding Tech (GT) team contributed to this article.

        "raw_content": "Go Wild with BLUETTI: Unveiling Industry-First Power Solutions at CES 2024\nLAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / January 9, 2024 / BLUETTI, a pioneer in portable power solutions, will dazzle attendees at the upcoming in Las Vegas from January 9-12. In addition to displaying various power stations, the company will debut two innovations for extreme outdoor experiences: BLUETTI SwapSolar industry-first power combo, and AC240 water-resistant portable power station.\nBLUETTI SwapSolar: Chill on the Road, Power Where You Roam\nBLUETTI SwapSolar is a groundbreaking combination of the AC180T portable generator and the BLUETTI MultiCooler portable refrigerator.\nAt first glance, the BLUETTI AC180T appears to be the larger version of the AC180 with similar specs: 1,433Wh capacity, 1,800W output, and 2,700W lifting power. But that's not the case. The AC180T employs a hot-swappable battery design that allows users to swap out its two 716.8Wh batteries for instant power at any time. The real kicker is that the AC180T can operate flawlessly with either two batteries inside, or with one inserted and the other powering its companion - the BLUETTI MultiCooler, the world's first LFP-powered 3-in-1 portable fridge.\nThe BLUETTI MultiCooler is a fridge, freezer, and ice maker all in one. Featuring a 40-liter compartment with temperature control from -20\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F), it can chill 65 cans of soda or keep the sausages frozen for a picnic. This multi-talent makes long-term road trips and off-grid living more fun and easier.\nOne of the MultiCooler's standout features is its built-in ice maker. Owners can pour a bottle of water into a special chamber on the top of the cooler, and it will start churning out crystal cube ice within minutes. The ice maker produces ice using moving water, an advanced ice-making technology that allows for consistent production of high-quality ice. Unlike its competitors, the MultiCooler can make ice by charging from the car, even without a battery inside. This is truly an industry first.\nIt can also be charged from a wall outlet, solar panels, and the AC180T's battery. Run times vary depending on temperature settings and usage, but users can expect about 6 days of fresh food for their road trips with two full batteries.\nExperience the magic of BLUETTI SwapSolar by checking it out at CES 2024 or securing your spot in its crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo starting January 9, 2024. The official launch is set in February.\nBLUETTI AC240 Water-Resistant and Dust-Proof Outdoor Power Station\nEarlier this year, BLUETTI launched the world's first water-resistant portable generator, the AC60. But they're not stopping there, launching the AC240, another weatherproof outdoor power station with home backup potential. With an IP65 rating for water and dust protection, it thrives in harsh conditions - perfect for beach outings, desert adventures, fieldwork, yachting, boating, fishing, and more.\nThe AC240 provides 2,400W of power for almost everything in an RV, such as fridges, window air conditioners, microwaves, heaters, and coffee makers. A 1,536Wh LFP battery can power a 20 cu. ft. modern fridge(1.2kWh/day) for at least one day. Charging the AC240 is as fast as 70 minutes from the grid at 2,400W, or 2 hours from a 1,200W solar charge.\nThe B210 expansion battery adds 2,150Wh of power and, more impressively, can also be used as a water-resistant DC power supply for small devices. With four expansion batteries, this package can reach a total capacity of 10kWh, enough to power a grand beach bonfire party or a remote cabin for days.\nCombining two AC240 units doubles the overall output to 4,800 watts at 120 volts and multiplies the maximum storage capacity to 20kWh with eight B210s . , opening up more possibilities. Its 15ms UPS function also promises more reliable home backup in the event of a power outage.\nBe sure to catch the early bird price when the AC240 goes on sale on the BLUETTI official website and Amazon on April 2, 2024.\nDiverse Displayed Products: Powering Every Lifestyle\nAlongside these innovations, BLUETTI will showcase several new offline versions of portable generators and home storage products at CES 2024. These include the world's first IP65 water-resistant and dust-proof , the most lightweight , and modular battery systems like the\nseries and\nseries for indoor and outdoor use.

It features a 40-liter compartment, enough to hold sixty-five 12 oz aluminum cans, with full temperature controls from -4\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C ). It can be charged from a wall outlet, solar panels, standard car-charging port or one of the AC180T's batteries.\nBLUETTI SwapSolar will be crowdsourced on Indiegogo starting January 9, 2024. The official launch is set for January 31st.\nBLUETTI AC240:\nThe AC240 is an expandable portable power station that has an IP65 rating. An IP (Ingress Protection) rating is the industry standard rating dust/dirt and waterproof protection for consumer electronic products, or a measure of how \u2018weatherproof' a product is. A Rating of IP65 offers full protection against dust and other small particles and offers protection against low pressure jets of water.\n'The AC240 thrives in harsh conditions - perfect for beach outings, desert adventures, fieldwork, yachting, boating, fishing, and more. with over 2400 watts of power, it can run almost everything in an RV, such as fridges, window air conditioners, microwaves, heaters, and coffee makers.' - - James Ray, Chief Officer of Product.\nCharging the AC240 takes 70 minutes from a standard wall outlet or as quick as 2 hours from three 400 watt solar panels (1,200 watts total). Its 15 millisecond UPS function allows for nearly instant home backup energy in the event of a power outage.\nThe AC240 is compatible with BLUETTI's B210 expansion battery and adds 2,150 Wh of power for each B210. The B210 can also be used independently as a water-resistant DC power supply for small devices. One AC240 can be used with up to four expansion batteries, for a total system capacity of 10,000 Wh (10 kWh).\nThe AC240 goes on sale on BLUETTI's official website and Amazon on early April, 2024.\nOther Products Displayed:Alongside the above innovations, BLUETTI will showcase several new retail ready packaged versions of their portable power stations at CES 2024.
