        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Recap Report\nCES 2024 was back to pre-pandemic attendance levels with an officially announced number of 135,000 attendees. And over 4,000 vendors which were spread out across the city, from the convention center to Mandalay Bay, up and down the Strip. Restaurants were full and cab lines were busy.\nI blew into town for just a few days in order to visit with clients, see a few companies we\u2019ve been following, attend our 15th Annual Women in Consumer Technology Legacy Awards event at the Venetian Hotel, and dine with friends and colleagues. Here\u2019s my take on CES.\nWe\u2019ve been following Ossia for the better part of six years and continue to see real progress in what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer in wireless remote power applications. Ossia\u2019s booth was huge, it was packed, they announced six partners who will have product out this year, which means we are approaching real-world applications for this unique technology. Here\u2019s the short version:\nOssia\u2019s Cota platform is able to beam power from one location to another. In other words, the Cota transmitter (which nominally would be installed behind sheet rock, so not in view) would be able to power a cell phone from across the room. No wires. No docking the phone on a \u2018wireless\u2019 charger. Real wireless power over the air!\nHere is where this technology will really shine in the near future \u2013 one of the initial manufacturers they are partnering with are our good friends at Nice. Nice recently introduced their Sun Shades line of window treatment shading products (one of which won our 2023 Performance Home Award for Best Product!). Utilizing Ossia\u2019s technology, they showed a prototype of a motorized window shade that was powered remotely by the Cota transmitter. So, instead of clunky lithium batteries which need to be changed out and have never really impressed me as an elegant solution for remodels, designers will be able to hang shades and have them draw power remotely, over the air. I believe this will energize motorozed shades for the remodel market and be a real game changer.\nOliverIQ had the most buzz of any new vendor in the Smart Home space going into the show. Eric Smith, Will West and Glen Mella, who brought Control4 to life, are back with their their groundbreaking Smart Home as a Service (SHaaS) platform. The launch heralds a new era in the smart home by offering a subscription model with unlimited support and a user-friendly app for control and real automation of today\u2019s most popular smart home devices.\nOliver integrates hardware products in its SHaaS platform including lighting, security, doorbell, thermostat and smart speakers. \u201cAll the basic systems in your house can work together to make your life better whether you want security, comfort, energy savings or convenience,\u201d explains Eric Smith, Co-Founder and CTO of the company.\nPartnering with national and global service providers, OliverIQ aims to scale their SHaaS platform rapidly, offering comprehensive product support, unlimited online and phone support, in-home assistance, and security system monitoring. This model makes OliverIQ\u2019s SHaaS platform the first-of-its-kind solution that simplifies smart home device interoperability for the consumer. By uniting various connected devices through the OliverIQ software which will be embedded either in common household devices such as routers, set top boxes, or the OliverIQ hub, along with a single, easy-to-use application backed by round-the-clock technical support, OliverIQ will bring a reimagined and completely accessible smart home to the market.\nI ran over to the convention center to visit with my good friend Peter Weedfald, Senior Vice President Home & Consumer Sales & Marketing for Sharp Electronics Marketing Company of America. Peter gave me a private tour of their new Video Display products, including the new Aquos home entertainment display that is packed with exciting technology you really have to see to believe.\nBottom line: Sharp is delivering competitively priced displays with cutting edge technology, and on the high-end Aquos display, audio that forstalls the need for a seperate sound bar. Look for them this year across the country at select A/V retailers.\nPeter also took me over to the Central Hall show floor and their huge (and packed!) booth to look at the wealth of technology they are developing. Transparent glass for video displays, ultra-quiet appliances, minituraized sensors, etc. Sharp is on the cutting edge of so many innovations that we\u2019ll be following up with Peter this year on a feature magazine article and deep diving into the nuts and bolts of this amazing company.\nThe highlight of any CES over the past 15 years has been our Legacy Awards event at the Venetian Hotel that honors the most remarkable women in our industry. Listening to the achievements of these fantastic role models is riveting and the networking of attendees is off the charts. Bravo!\nSee our full recap here.\nThe Nobi Ceiling is a ceiling-mounted version of Nobi\u2019s award-winning AI-powered Smart Lamps that detect and prevent falls and monitor health and activity patterns, significantly improving the safety and well-being of older adults. The Nobi Ceiling offers the same combination of elegant design and cutting-edge AI technology Nobi is known for, ensuring older adults can age independently and with dignity. Already a proven care techdevice in the European market and senior living facilities in the U.S., Nobi also announced plans to bring its full line of smart lamps directly to U.S. consumers in 2024.\nI talked with Niels Coch, Head of Nobi USA and we discussed Living in Place and the interior design professionals who work in this space. Since they are also likely involved with lighting design, this seems like a great fit. So any of you designers looking for more info, visit nobi.life or contact Niels at niels.coch@nobi.life\nWe were only in town for two nights, so dinners consisted of our traditional visit to dine with friends at Bouchon\u2019s in the Venetian (always wonderful!) and new favorite Yardbird which is also in the Venetian. Yardbird has the most awesome fried chicken and waffles, so if you haven\u2019t visited, do yourself a solid and get there!\nYou may also like\nTidying Up\nHurricane Strength Coffee\nLand & Sea Entertainment\nEric Meets Eric\nBasalte \u2013 A Love Story\nA Glimpse of the Future\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Technology Designer."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 11 most exciting tech trends of 2024, according to CES 2024\nA postcard from the near future, courtesy of CES 2024\nCES 2024 is over, and what have we learned? Well, mainly not to put our hands in wearable ovens or indecently expose ourselves in smart showers. But also, some more serious lessons about where tech is headed in 2024. Yes, this year's CES gave us some fascinating glimpses of how gadgets could change our lives this year \u2013 and we've rounded up all of those flashes of insight below.\nIn short, it's going to be another fun, eventful year in tech. There'll be some slight annoyances \u2013\u00a0for example, ChatGPT being shoehorned into absolutely everything, and manufacturers tempting us with massive TVs that we can't really afford. But there'll also be some exciting shifts, from the arrival of the first proper AI hardware to the emergence of Bluetooth Auracast and neural headphones.\nAs fun as they are, we've shied away from some of CES 2024's more exuberant flourishes like transparent TVs and personal robots in our list below. Instead, you'll find a list of all the trends and technologies that are likely to have a genuine impact on your tech life in 2024 \u2013\u00a0for better or worse. So take a break from your floundering tech resolutions for a moment and join us on a ride through this year's biggest tech trends, as predicted by CES...\n1. Mini-LED TVs are about to get massive...\nTV are always one of the biggest stories of CES and one of the big trends this year was truly massive mini-LED models. TCL, which revealed that its ultra-large TV category grew 600% in 2023, showed off a monstrous 115-inch mini-LED model at CES called the QM891G, while its new QM8 TVs will be available in sizes ranging from 75-98 inches.\nNot to be outdone, Hisense fought back with a 110-inch model in its premium ULED X lineup (with an eye-searing 10,000 nits of peak brightness). But the good news for our wallets is that these increasingly vast mini-LED sets are also likely to be (relatively) affordable this year, certainly compared to OLED.\nOn that theme, Hisense also revealed that'll be launching a 100-inch regular QLED model in 2024 \u2013 which, if history is any guide, should be temptingly affordable for its size.\n2. ...and OLED TVs will get much brighter\nNot to be outshone by their feisty mini-LED and microLED rivals, OLED TVs were also bigging up their credentials at CES 2024\u00a0\u2013 and this year, we're likely to see them get much brighter. The most obvious example was the new LG C4, which we discovered is indeed much brighter than last year's C3, despite both sets using the same core OLED panel.\nThis boost comes from both improved processing and a redesigned micro lens array (MLA). And that isn't the only upgrade OLEDs will get in 2024 \u2013 the new Samsung S95D has a 'Glare Free' display that impressed us so much that we said called it \"a reason to choose the flagship if you have a bright room\". If you need a new TV, it's likely to be a very good year to upgrade.\n3. Qi2 wireless charging will finally go mainstream\nCES 2024 may have delivered its dose of wacky ideas like wearable ovens, but it was also about the dawn of useful new tech standards \u2013 and one of those is Qi2 wireless chargers. This is very good news for smartphones, in particular Android phones, as Qi2 supports a minimum of 15W charging, the same as Apple MagSafe.\nUnfortunately, we're still waiting for smartphones (other than the iPhone 15 series) to arrive with Qi2 support. But when they inevitably do this year, CES 2024 has ensured that we won't be short of wireless chargers to choose from.\nThere were several Qi2 products flaunting their wares at the show, with our pick being Satechi's folding 3-in-1 model (above). It'll be available to buy for $130 (around \u00a3105 / AU$195) when it goes on sale in Q2 (sometime between March and May).\n4. Bluetooth Auracast will change headphones\nLike Qi2 charging, Bluetooth Auracast was another tech standard that had its breakout moment CES 2024. We were so impressed after trying Auracast at CES that we concluded that \"it'll change our relationship with headphones\".\nWhy so? Auracast's key skill is allowing your compatible headphones to tune into devices that you're not paired with. And this will soon give us a whole range of benefits \u2013 from letting you tune into the gate announcements at the airport so you don't miss your flight to listening to a sports bar's TV screen.\nThe other benefit of Auracast is that it can broadcast to several devices simultaneously \u2013\u00a0for example, letting a co-worker quickly share the audio from their Windows laptop or iPhone (with a password to stop random listeners) or allowing those with hearing aids to easily tune into an public speaking event. It's still early days for Auracast with little hardware support so far, but expect to hear a lot more about it in 2024.\n5. AI gadgets usher in next-gen voice assistants\nSmartphones have devoured most handheld gadgets over the past decade, but the gadgets could yet make a comeback in 2024 \u2013\u00a0particularly if the new Rabbit R1 is anything to go by.\nThe mysterious handheld gizmo, which promises to let you talk to your favorite apps using natural language and end the age of endless phone swiping, was one of the unexpected stars of the show.\nTime will tell if it lives up to that early hype, but it's set a blueprint for other AI gadgets to follow this year \u2013\u00a0we just hope half of them look as good as this Teenage Engineering-designed sidekick.\n6. E-Ink will personalize our laptops our phones\nE-ink isn't a new technology and neither is the idea of using it on laptop covers, but at CES 2024 it looked like the concept had finally matured enough to go mainstream. The Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE concept laptop (above) was one such example, using E-Ink Prism tech to let you add not just pictures but animations to the cover. Stickers suddenly look a bit old hat.\nThe Chinese accessories company Infinix also used the same technology to make concept smartphone covers that can change and maintain their colors without consuming any extra power. While both Lenovo and Infinix's examples are still at the concept stage, we're expecting to see more fully-fledged implementations this year.\n7. Smart rings will take the baton from smartwatches\nSmartwatches weren't exactly in short supply at CES 2024, but there was a distinct shift in wearables hype towards smart rings. They aren't a new concept, as owners of the Oura Ring will attest \u2013 but this year will see an explosion of competitors, potentially including the long-awaited Samsung Galaxy Ring.\nAt CES, we saw Amazfit Helio Ring impress with its health-tracking potential, while the Evie smart ring returns after launching last year. Not that all smart rings are designed to track your sleep or steps \u2013\u00a0the Lotus ring (above) is effectively a wearable controller that lets you control home appliances, albeit ones made by Lotus itself.\nYes, competition is already strong among the best smart rings, but in 2024 we're going to see them hit smartwatch levels of popularity.\n8. Neural headphones are ready to read your mind\nThe\u00a0best headphones\u00a0are no longer just about delivering super-duper audio quality with an immersive sound stage, isolating active noise cancellation, and a comfy design that makes you forget you\u2019re wearing a pair of cans. Rather they aim to add exciting new strings to their bows; this year, it\u2019s all about neural technologies.\nThat\u2019s right,\u00a0at CES 2024 we saw headphones that can read your mind. The Naqi Neural Earbuds are designed \u201cas a safe, non-invasive alternative to brain implants\u201d that could offer you full control over a Windows or Mac computer \u2013 including browsing the net and playing games \u2013 by using gyroscopic, muscle, and brainwave sensors.\nThen there\u2019s the MyWaves Technologies Pebble with a puck that you suction to your forehead. While you sleep it will scan your brain waves and play you a bespoke music playlist that should help you get your 40 winks. Naturally, some of the products sound more impressive \u2013 and appealing \u2013 than others, but expect to see more neural tech creeping into your headphones in 2024 and beyond.\n9. ChatGPT will be shoe-horned into everything\nLast year's great breakout star, ChatGPT, hit such heights that it's now destined for an inevitable fate in 2024 \u2013\u00a0being shunted in every consumer tech device imaginable, whether it's a good idea or not.\nCES 2024 was full of such examples, from the creepy WeHead \u2013 which gives the chatbot an unsettling face \u2013\u00a0to Volkswagen announcing that it's bringing ChatGPT into its cars for AI-based conversations.\nGiven ChatGPT has a propensity to hallucinate and make things up, we're not sure it's something we want to take advice from while driving a large hunk of metal down the freeway. Expect a lot more of this in 2024 \u2013\u00a0for good and bad.\n10. Smart home tech will become invisible\nThe smart home continued to flounder in 2023, as the Matter standard failed to gain much traction. But at least the hardware will look good this year, if the best smart home tech of CES 2024 was anything to go by.\nThe main theme this year was home tech that disappears into the background or, even better, is completely invisible. This was the case with XGIMI Aladdin, a ceiling light that's also secretly a projector and Bluetooth speaker. The Baracoda BMind, which won the 'best wellness tech' category in our Best of CES 2024 awards, is also a mirror with hidden generative AI powers that can both understand and improve your mental health.\nBut on on a more day-to-day level, we also saw big tech players like Samsung and LG finally make TVs the natural center of the smart home. Samsung introduced a new dashboard called Now Plus to its televisions, while LG TVs became Matter-compatible Google Home hubs. Will this be the end for Nest hubs? Let's hope so \u2013 the fewer devices, the better, in our book.\n11. The Apple Vision Pro will be undercut by cheaper rivals\nApple skipped CES 2024, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from all the talk about its Vision Pro headset. Just as the convention kicked off, Apple officially confirmed that the\u00a0Vision Pro will start shipping in the US on February 2, with preorders launching on January 19.\nIn response, CES was full to the brim with \u2018Vision Pro rivals\u2019 all vying to show you they can deliver what Apple\u2019s spatial computer promises at a fraction of the cost. Xreal explicitly called its\u00a0new Air 2 Ultra glasses an affordable alternative to the Vision Pro\u00a0in its official press release.\nAsus\u2019 AirVision M1 smart specs don\u2019t boast the same kind of mixed-reality capabilities, but certainly have a name that feels a lot like an Apple product. And while Sony has yet to say how much its rival will cost, its\u00a0VR headset for the \u201cindustrial metaverse\u201d\u00a0(we think we just threw up a little) certainly looks set to challenge Apple\u2019s headset in the professional space.\nWith a\u00a0Samsung XR/VR headset\u00a0on the way and others also gearing up to release spatial computing gadgets, expect a lot more Vision Pro rivals to materialize in 2024 \u2013 with most of them celebrating how much cheaper they are than Apple's headset, which starts at a cool $3,499 (that's around \u00a32,800 / AU$5,300).\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
