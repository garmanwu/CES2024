        "raw_content": "Hi, what are you looking for?\necoustics.com\nNew Products\nBrane\u2019s X Portable Speaker Delivers Powerful Bass Performance: CES 2024\nThe Brane X is a unique rugged and portable Bluetooth speaker with built-in subwoofer that claims 10x the bass of competing models.\nBy\nPublished\nFlipboard\nReddit\nPinterest\nWhatsapp\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nNot everything at CES 2024 featured a massive screen or drone technology; portable Bluetooth speakers were extremely popular this year and one in particular really stood out from the rest.\nThere is no question that it is difficult for smaller brands to stand out in a category dominated by Sonos, JBL, Klipsch, and Bose, but Brane Audio merits a serious look for its Brane X portable speaker.\nThe Brane X was first shown at CES 2023 in January, but did not enter the market for sale until October 2023. We were intrigued by the prototype that we saw last year and really wanted to give the production version some listening time at the show.\nWhat is Brane X?\nWhat separates the Brane X portable speaker from the pack is that it is the first to incorporate a built-in subwoofer. Brane Audio claims that it can produce 10 times the sub-bass of other speakers in its class. Is that really the case?\nThe Brane X is built on new driver technology that breaks the most important law of audio, Hofmann\u2019s Iron Law. Hofmann\u2019s Iron Law states that you can have two, but not all three, of the following in a speaker: low bass, a small size, and efficiency.\nAll other speakers on the market today have to give up one. Most commercial portable speakers today compromise on low bass so that they can market something small and wireless.\nIn addition to the inclusion of a subwoofer, the Brane X includes features you would expect from a\u00a0 smart speaker: stereo sound, waterproofing, 12-hour battery life, Alexa integration, adjustable EQ, and free control app.\nWhat I Thought\nI was thoroughly impressed with the Brane X. Despite its compact size, it not only delivered excellent bass but a very clear midrange and treble range. In addition to Brane\u2019s official demo playlist, they allowed me to make a couple of requests for songs with deep bass content. My picks were \u201cMagic Man\u201d (Heart) which has a bass slide that can test the limits of any speaker, and \u201c7th Heaven\u201d (Angelina Jordan) which has a distinctive acoustic double bass intro that can reveal how much bass texture a speaker can reproduce. In both cases, the Brane X did better than I expected.\nSpecifications\nThe Brane X is available for $599, exclusively on braneaudio.com.\nMore from CES 2024\nHome > Latest > New Products > Loudspeakers > Wireless Speakers > Brane\u2019s X Portable Speaker Delivers Powerful Bass Performance: CES 2024\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best audio products at CES 2024\nMy pick of the top audio highlights to look out for in the year ahead\nCES 2024 may be wrapping up, but this year's event has been an amazing insight into what to expect in the world of consumer tech for the year ahead. The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding. The 64GB of onboard storage is expandable to 2TB via SD card, meaning your personal collection of audio files can be played back using the FiiO Music app. Streaming applications for all the best music streaming services (and more) can be downloaded and installed via either the Google Play Store or FiiO Store apps to deliver audio in its native quality.\nThe Full-HD 6-inch color touchscreen display on front is designed to provide easy system navigation, and the R9 comes supplied with a Bluetooth remote control too.\nThe FiiO R9 will be available from mid-January, priced at $1,499 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,239). For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

While the Brane X became commercially available in October, this will be the company's first public showcase. Starting today, the Brane X is available for purchase exclusively on braneaudio.com.\nAfter the Brane X earned widespread acclaim from Wirecutter, TechCrunch, and Billboard at CES 2023, there has been significant anticipation for its release from the global audio community. Called \"a miracle of applied physics and electro-magnetic engineering\" by TechHive, the Brane X enters the portable speaker market as the first and only speaker in its class to have a built-in subwoofer. With its breakthrough Repel-Attract Driver (R.A.D.) technology, the Brane X boasts 10 times the sub-bass compared to other portable speakers.\n\"The overwhelmingly positive reviews from our CES 2023 showcase put Brane Audio on the map before our October pre-order launch,\" said Joe Pinkerton, CEO and co-founder of Brane Audio. \"This year, we invite everybody to visit us for a demo and hear the Brane X for themselves. Audiophile or not, you'll definitely hear the overwhelming difference. We can't wait for people to experience the music they love in a whole new way.\"\nThe R.A.D. is the most significant innovation in audio driver technology in over a century. Because of the R.A.D., the portable speaker breaks Hofmann's Iron Law, which states that in order to produce deep bass, a speaker must be either large or draw a tremendous amount of electrical power.\nThe Brane X achieves a tenfold increase in deep bass without increasing size or power consumption. Compared to conventional small speakers in the same subwoofer range, it burns only 1/10th of the power. Using a combination of moving and stationary magnets, the R.A.D. creates a force that is equal and opposite to the force caused by large air pressure changes within a speaker enclosure. This produces new levels of deep bass that no other small, portable speaker can achieve.\nThe speaker also includes all the bells and whistles of the smart speakers consumers have come to expect -- it's waterproof, has a 12 hour battery life, stereo, Alexa integration, Spotify Connect, adjustable EQ, and a free, user-friendly app for phones.\nThe Brane X is retailing for $599 exclusively on shop.braneaudio.com. It's available in the U.S. only, but Brane Audio has plans to expand shipping globally in 2024. To learn more, visit braneaudio.com\nAbout Brane Audio\nBrane Audio is a sound technology company that is unlocking a radically new experience of sound.\nThe company's flagship product, Brane X, is the first mobile speaker in its size class with an internal subwoofer. Brane's breakthrough Repel-Attract-Driver (R.A.D.) delivers a 10x increase in sub-bass without any sacrifice in size or power consumption.\nR.A.D. represents the most significant innovation in audio driver technology in a century and breaks Hofmann's Iron Law by using a proprietary array of permanent magnets to cancel internal air pressure forces. This novel force cancellation design allows Brane speakers to be compact, efficient, and capable of producing deeper bass than any comparable speaker on the market.\nBrane Audio was founded in 2015 and is proudly based in the live music capital of Austin, Texas.

        "raw_content": "Brane X portable speaker packs a hell of a punch in a small package\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of Brane Audio yet, but trust me on this one: You will. One of my highlights at CES in Las Vegas today was listening to the company\u2019s debut speaker, the Brane X, side-by-side with some other well-known speaker brands. The company\u2019s founder has a background from high-precision magnetics, and after exiting his previous company, decided to apply this expertise to another space where magnets are important: Speakers.\nThe company\u2019s first product is the $600 Brane X, which is opening for pre-orders imminently. The big innovation is the company\u2019s Repel-Attract Driver (RAD). It use a combination of moving and stationary magnets to create a force that is equal and opposite to the force caused by large air pressure changes within a speaker enclosure. The result is the ability to move a large amount of air (and therefore punch a lot of bass around), in a small package that the company claims consumes 10% of the power that a conventional-tech subwoofer would.\n\u201cWe developed a new way of making audio. Specifically, we have a novel subwoofer. That uses a technology we call \u201crepel attract driver\u201d or RAD. It uses magnetic forces to cancel out the air pressure forces that are inherent when you\u2019re creating low subwoofer notes. Using traditional technology, there\u2019s even a law \u2013 Hoffman\u2019s law \u2013 that says, can\u2019t have deep bass, an efficient speaker and have it be compact. As you make a subwoofer smaller, the air pressure gets higher and higher, and you\u2019re drawing more and more power,\u201d explains Joe Pinkerton, co-founder and CEO at Brane Audio, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBy canceling that pressure force with a magnetic force, it stays in its container. That means all you have to overcome its own inertia. It is a factor of roughly 100 times more efficient in the subwoofer range. That enables us to make it a tenth of the size and draw a tenth of the power.\u201d\nBrane Audio showed off its speaker alongside the Sonos Move, blowing it out of the water. Image Credit: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps\nYou\u2019ve already done the math, dear reader: Smaller, lighter, and less power-hungry equals interesting tech for portable speakers. And that\u2019s exactly what the company built in the Brane X. It contains an 8-inch subwoofer in a portable speaker that can run on battery power for 12 hours. It also has all the other bells and whistles you\u2019d expect from a high-end portable speaker: It has Alexa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and can run Spotify. In addition to the aforementioned bass-pumper, it contains a pair of tweeters and a pair of mid-range speakers, so it retains its power to play stereo sound. The speaker is IP 5x rated, meaning it is more resistant to rain than your BBQ or pool party.\nIn the suite where the tech was demoed, I found myself checking behind the sofa whether the company had hidden additional speakers: A huge amount of bass, plus a weirdly immersive soundscape coming from a box the size of a small toaster was a distinctly uncanny experience. I couldn\u2019t locate the other speakers, and the team assured me that yes, it all really came from their little box.\nBrane Audio\u2019s subwoofer uses an FPGA to balance its magnet exactly where it needs it. Image Credit: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps\nPinkerton started Active Power, a company in the energy space in the early 1990s that created huge 15,000-pound, magnetic-bearing flywheels for power storage. The precision needed to use a combination of static and dynamic magnets to keep these flywheels exactly balanced using an axial magnetic bearing meant developing an extremely precise feedback loop. A while after taking the company public in 2000, he started a Clean Energy Labs to start looking for other opportunities. One of the technologies the company looked into was using graphene to create more efficient switches.\n\u201cAs we were switching it at 5,000 times a second. We were like, \u2018wow, that\u2019s making a lot of sound for its size,\u2019 and that was just a chip-level device,\u201d Pinkerton laughs. From there, he wondered what would happen if they were trying to make sound on purpose. \u201cWe span Brane Audio out of Clean Energy Labs in 2015, and just said \u2018hey, let\u2019s make this membrane-based speaker.\u2019 We worked on that for and we worked on that for several years and were going to launch something in 2020. Then COVID hit, and the factory shut down.\u201d\nFrom there it was back to the drawing board \u2014 but Pinkerton wasn\u2019t ready to let the technology rest quite yet.\n\u201cOur experience is something a normal audio engineer would have no idea even existed. It took us years to figure out to perfect the technology,\u201d Pinkerton says, describing the path to a final, launchable speaker.\nThe speaker is big for a portable speaker; it\u2019s more of a small boombox than the kind of speaker you can just lob in your hand luggage for a trip overseas. It seems like it\u2019s better for a speaker you bring with you on a road trip, move from room to room in the house, or plonk down outside for a pool party.\n\u201cThis is\u00a0 sneak peek of the Brane X. We\u2019re doing a full-blown launch at South by Southwest in Austin in mid-March,\u201d Pinkerton concludes, and suggests that the company has speakers with its tech in smaller form factors and with more modest price points on the drawing board."
