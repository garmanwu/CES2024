The Consumer Electronics Show (CES), known for being the largest and most influential consumer electronics exhibition in the world, has been a cornerstone of the global consumer technology industry since its inception in 1967.\nFrom January 9th to 12th, this historic event, originating from 1967, attracted tech elites and innovators from all corners of the globe.\nThis year, over 130,000 attendees and exhibitors from 153 countries gathered to witness the latest breakthroughs from tech and automotive giants.\nThe lineup included not only tech behemoths like Google, Amazon, Qualcomm, Sony, and Samsung but also automotive leaders like Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Marelli, Hyundai Mobis, and Valeo.\nChinese exhibitors, as reported by Reuters, were particularly prominent, with 1,114 companies occupying more than a quarter of the booths. This significant presence not only demonstrates China's strength in high-tech and new energy sectors but also underscores its growing importance on the global tech stage.\nCES, an annual event, is more than just a celebration of tech innovation; it's a barometer for the future of the automotive industry. From advanced autonomous driving assist systems to core chip technology, and to upgraded cabin experiences, CES 2024 reveals groundbreaking new technologies in the automotive sphere.\nDespite a slight decrease in electric vehicle (EV) displays at CES this year, the participation of brands like Mercedes, Honda, and the emerging Vietnamese automotive force VINFAST\nhighlighted the vitality and innovation in the EV sector.\nFurthermore, renowned automotive brands such as Ford, BMW, Hyundai, and Chevrolet showcased their latest in-car technologies.

BlackBerry's QNX real-time operating system, known for its security, played a pivotal role in developing safe and reliable automotive systems ranging from assisted autonomous driving to cockpit displays.\nCES 2024 showcased the latest advancements in Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) technology, including software systems in various vehicles and interactive demonstrations, along with collaborations with AWS and other partners in innovative automotive technology development.\nAMD's exhibit was also noteworthy. Their Versal AI Edge XA adaptive SoC and Ryzen Embedded V2000A series processors provided robust technological support for the future of infotainment systems, advanced driving safety, and autonomous driving.\nParticular Highlights from Chinese Exhibitors at CES 2024:\nWeRide: Leading the Way in Intelligent Mobility\nEstablished in 2017, WeRide (Chinese: \u00e6\u2013\u2021\u00e8\u00bf\u0153\u00e7\u0178\u00a5\u00e8\u00a1\u0152) is a global leader in L4 autonomous driving technology. With operations in over 26 cities worldwide, WeRide has accumulated over 25 million kilometers in autonomous driving, covering smart mobility, freight, and sanitation.\nAt CES, WeRide presented its latest product, Robobus (an L4 level autonomous minibus), and offered on-site test drives. This vehicle, the world's first pre-installed production Robobus, can reach speeds of up to 40 km/h.\nXPENG AEROHT: Revolutionizing Urban Air Mobility\nFunded by the chairman of XPeng Motors, XPENG AEROHT (Chinese:\u00e5\u00b0\ufffd\u00e9\u00b9\ufffd\u00e6\u00b1\u2021\u00e5\u00a4\u00a9) is Asia's largest flying car enterprise, merging intelligent car and modern aviation technologies. At CES 2024, XPENG AEROHT showcased the AEROHT flying car, drawing global attention.\nThis vehicle is capable of both ground travel and vertical takeoff through unique propeller technology, offering a new possibility for urban air travel and tourism. XPENG AEROHT's groundbreaking product not only displays China's strength in the global tech innovation sector but also paints a picture of a more intelligent, convenient, and futuristic urban air travel.\nHesai Technology: Disruptive ADAS LiDAR Products\nA global leader in LiDAR development and manufacturing, @Hes (NASDAQ: HSAI) (Chinese: \u00e7\u00a6\u00be\u00e8\u00b5\u203a\u00e7\u00a7\u2018\u00e6\u0160\u20ac) offers products widely used in passenger and commercial vehicles supporting Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, unmanned delivery vehicles, AGVs, and other intelligent robotic applications.\nAt CES, Hesai introduced its flagship product, AT512, a long-range ADAS LiDAR with a compact design, industry-leading 300-meter range (at 10% reflectivity), and resolution enhancements.\nAdditionally, Hesai unveiled the new ultra-slim ET25 ADAS LiDAR, designed for easy integration behind vehicle windshields, enhancing aerodynamics and protecting the LiDAR from dust and debris. The ET25 offers a 250-meter range at 10% reflectivity and received the 2024 CES Innovation Award for Best New Product.\nIn summary, CES 2024 was not just a tech fest but a crucial platform for showcasing innovative automotive technologies.

Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

With a GDP of approximately $3.89 trillion, the Golden State configures between Germany and the United Kingdom. Thanks to Hollywood, Silicon Valley, manufacturing, and agricultural industries, California is one of the major economic engines of the United States.\nThere are over four million small local businesses here that employ nearly 50 percent of the state\u2019s workforce. While many contributing factors fuel the economy, California\u2019s biggest industries are a tighter list. Here\u2019s a roundup for you.\nThese are the Largest Industries in California\n1. Agriculture\nAccording to 2022 statistics, California\u2019s farms and ranches received $55.9 billions for their output. Yes, billion with a \u201cb\u201d.\u00a0 As of 2021, California's agricultural exports totaled $22.5 billions. Excluded from this total is the impact the industry has on other sectors, including shipping and warehousing\u2014altogether, the trio makes up California\u2019s biggest industries.\nIn case you didn\u2019t know this about the Golden State\u2019s Central Valley, the region yields more crops and farm-based goods than any other U.S. state. This agricultural hub is where the magic happens\u2014asparagus, grapes, lettuce, orange, rice, shelled almonds, tomatoes, and milk being the main produce.\nDoes your business rank among the best in California?\nRecomended businesses\nShow me California.com Recommended Businesses near\nCategories\nDoes your business rank among the best in California?\nLearn more about our selection criteria and vetting process.\n2. Film and Television\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why the movie industry was established in sunny California, we\u2019re here to answer your question. There\u2019s more than one reason behind it. Sure\u2014over 300 days of sunshine make for stunning filming locations. However, here are a few more things at play behind one of the largest industries in California.\nMovies were becoming more and more popular in the 1900s, and an increase in production was necessary in order to meet the demand. This mostly had to do with the weather, but California also had non-union labor at the time. This made film production significantly cheaper than on the East Coast. Pair this with the fact that practically any SoCal location could stand in for a movie set, and you\u2019ve got yourself an up-and-coming industry.\nNeed help with a home improvement project?\nGet a free quote today!\nEnter Your Zip Code\nEnter Your Zip Code\nNowadays, far beyond the glitz and glamour, California\u2019s film and television industry is a vital part of the state\u2019s economy. La La Land creates content that beams all over the world, in turn employing hundreds of thousands of people. The industry also impacts many other sectors, most notably film tourism. If you\u2019re a movie buff thinking of visiting your favorite filming locations, no place is better than the Golden State.\n3. Travel and Tourism\nIt should not be surprising that travel and tourism are California\u2019s most vital engines for economic growth. Defined by big, ambitious ideas, California has been a powerful leader in this industry. The state draws visitors not just from other states, but also from around the world.\nTravelers spend hundreds of millions of dollars while vacationing here, bringing in $114.9 billions into the state\u2019s economy according to 2019 statistics. This sort of spending brought $12.2 billions in local and state tax revenue. As a result, the industry provided jobs to 1.2 million California residents.\nThere\u2019s so many places worth visiting - it\u2019s nearly impossible to list them all. According to a TV commercial titled Living the Dream, the most popular hotspots include Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Disneyland, Napa Valley, Pebble Beach, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco, Yosemite, Venice Beach, and more. The next time you\u2019re traveling, make sure to add these destinations to your itinerary.\n4. Tech\nSilicon Valley is home to thousands of tech companies, and hands down one of the best regions to live in if you want to work in tech. It wasn\u2019t always that way.\nIn the 1940s, when computers were still the size of rooms, a man named William Shockley co-invented the transistor at Bell Labs. This later became known as the computer processor. In 1956, Shockley left Bell and founded his own company which made transistors out of silicon and not germanium. That was quite innovative for the time. A curious journalist named Don Hoefler wrote a three-part report about the semiconductor industry in 1971, titled Silicon Valley USA. Obviously, the name caught on.\nNeed help with a home improvement project?\nGet a free quote today!\nEnter Your Zip Code\nEnter Your Zip Code\nWith growing popularity, tech became more and more synonymous with the Silicon Valley industry. Especially since companies like Atari, Apple, Oracle, eBay, Yahoo, Paypal, and Google were founded in the area. Better yet, most\u2014if not all of these companies\u2014are leaders in their respective industries. Software, social media, robotics, fiber optics, and medical instruments companies create jobs and generate tax revenue.\n5. Service\nWhen it comes to the service sector, the Golden State is nothing short of impressive. Consisting of professional, business, education, and health services, as well as financial activities and leisure, this industry makes California a great place to live and work. It hosts the largest banks in the U.S.\u2014expect to find Wells Fargo, Charles Schwab Corporation, Silicon Valley Bank, and CIT Bank here. Colleges, universities, and other educational institutions also fall under this sector.\nThe University of California contributes a GDP of about $32.8 billion dollars annually to the economy. Throughout the years, 70 faculty and stuff members of the univercity have been awarded with the highest honor of all - with 71 Nobel Prizes.\nFastest Growing Industries in California\n6. Healthcare\nAsk any California resident to identify the largest single component in their thriving economy, and chances are they will reply with high-tech, motion pictures, or agriculture. They will rarely mention the healthcare industry. However, over the last half of the century, the Golden State\u2019s medical care industry has become by far one of the state\u2019s largest growing economic activities. As one of the biggest growing industries in Los Angeles and the state, healthcare surpasses all other employment rates.\n7. Construction\nConstruction is among the fastest-growing industries in the Golden State, employing five percent of the state\u2019s private workforce. In the summer of 2019, seasonally adjusted construction employment topped 900,000 for the first time in 12 years. Despite the slower growth rate in construction employment, California contractors still outshine their counterparts. That's all thanks to the neverending projects.\nOne such construction project is the award ceremony for the 2028 Olympics, which will be hosted in the City of Angels. This is already starting to spring forth numerous building ideas, including new sports venues and hotels.\nNeed help with a home improvement project?\nGet a free quote today!\nEnter Your Zip Code\nEnter Your Zip Code\nNeed help with a home improvement project?\nGet a free quote today!\nEnter Your Zip Code\nEnter Your Zip Code\nInspiration delivered straight to your inbox.\nAwesome!
