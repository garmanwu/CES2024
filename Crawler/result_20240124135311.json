Some of them were local brands, while others were high-end imports.

Their model had the #sideskirts sunk in on the front door as before, but it also had a rectangular opening with an air filter installed below the rear door.

        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

Some of them were local brands, while others were high-end imports. I couldn't help but notice how the side skirts (#sidespoilers) on these vehicles sunk in on the front door and then gradually recovered on the rear door. It was a good design that works well for the speed limit of 120km/h on Chinese highways.\nA couple of years ago, Honpe Tech unveiled a new #carprototype that boasted an even safer design. Their model had the #sideskirts sunk in on the front door as before, but it also had a rectangular opening with an air filter installed below the rear door. It was an innovative solution to improving airflow and reducing drag while driving.\nWhen driving on the highway, which one will be much safer in your opinion? And tell me about something you've seen a car driving on the #autobahn road in Germany.\n364 followers\nI said no way to read a young girl's heart, but the industrial designer from Apple made it and Honpe Tech is able to prototype it.\nThe cherry pink Apple 15 you will get in a couple weeks may be under production in China's Shenzhen, Zhengzhou, or India's Tamil Nadu. And the approximate output of all the series of Apple 15 may reach up to 75 million sets.\nWill you book the Apple 15 series with the industrial design in cherry pink? Don't get it lost in your cozy room.\n#isaidnoway #apple15 #cherrypink #industrialdesign\nJoin now to see what you are missing\nSimilar pages\nHONPE Technology SRL\nManufacturing\nTurin, Torino\nHonpe Prototyping Mexico\nIndustrial Machinery Manufacturing\nGuadalajara, Jalisco\nGFDS Global Future Designs and Solutions Inc.\nEntertainment Providers\nAnkara, \u00c3\u2021ankaya\nDefence Leaders\nEvents Services\nChelmsford, England\nISRINGHAUSEN GmbH & Co.
