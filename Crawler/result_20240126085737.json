        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CISA\u2019s \u2018Secure by Design\u2019 directive faces challenging road to adoption\nThe harbinger of things to come for software developers came\nearlier this spring when CISA Director Jen Easterly singled out the private\nsector during a speech at Carnegie Mellon University for the continued flood of\ndata breaches plaguing the U.S.\nIn her view, the private sector has become too comfortable\nshifting the safety burden for products to consumers -- which has subjected\nthem to endless patches, updates and privacy risks -- rather than making sure\nthe products are safe when they hit the market.\n\u201cThe situation is not a sustainable one,\u201d Easterly says. \u201cWe\nneed a new model where consumer safety is front and center in all phases of the\ntechnology product lifecycle \u2014 with security designed in from the beginning \u2014\nand strong safety features enabled right out of the box, without added costs,\u201d\nEasterly says.\nThis was followed by the release of Shifting\nthe Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for\nSecurity-by-Design and -Default -- joint guidance urges software\nmanufacturers to take urgent steps necessary to ship products that are\nsecure-by-design and -default.\nEasterly acknowledged this effort will require a \u201csignificant\nshift\u201d in how technology is produced, including the code used to develop\nsoftware. But she argues adopting the guidelines will help both organizations\nand technology providers.\n\u201cIt will mean less time fixing problems, more time focusing\non innovation and growth, and importantly, it will make life much harder for\nour adversaries,\u201d Easterly says.\nSenior Execs Called Out\nCISA\u2019s new guidelines were developed with recommendations\nfrom the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nand international partners in Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, New\nZealand and the Netherlands.\n\u201cSecure-by-Design\u201d means technology products are built in a\nway that reasonably protects against malicious cyber actors successfully\ngaining access to devices, data and connected infrastructure. Software\nmanufacturers should perform a risk assessment, CISA says, to identify and\nenumerate prevalent cyber threats to critical systems, and then include\nprotections in product blueprints that account for the evolving cyber threat\nlandscape.\n\u201cSecure-by-Default\u201d means products are resilient against\nprevalent exploitation techniques out-of-the-box without additional charge.\nThese products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities\nwithout end users having to take additional steps to secure them.\nAmong other things, CISA\u2019s directive calls on companies to\n\u201cembrace radical transparency and accountability. Software manufacturers should\npride themselves in delivering safe and secure products, as well as\ndifferentiating themselves among the rest of the manufacturer community based\non their ability to do so.\u201d\nCISA also called on manufacturers to build organizational\nstructure and leadership to achieve these cyber goals, including senior\nexecutives prioritizing security as a critical element of product development.\nThere has been a mixed reaction to the guidelines in the cybersecurity\nindustry. Some have criticized the document for being too vague or aspirational,\nwhile others believe the guidelines are just what is needed to move the needle\non product safety.\nHenrik Plate, security research for Endor Labs, says it\u2019s surprising\nthat CISA\u2019s document goes into detail on SQL injection while it stays\nhigh-level in other areas. \u201cComparable to the approach taken by the authors of\nthe OWASP Top 10, for example, it would have been possible to speak more\nbroadly of injection vulnerabilities rather than specifically highlighting SQL\ninjection attacks,\u201d he says.\nPlate says the document already refers repeatedly to the\nSecure Software Development Framework (SSDF), which is also known as National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) SP 800-218. So he sees the CISA\ndocument as being \u201cclearly linked\u201d to other regulatory efforts following\nPresident Biden\u2019s executive order requiring software suppliers of federal\nagencies to provide self-attestations regarding their secure software\ndevelopment practices.\n\u201cWe appreciate that the (CISA) document explicitly refers to\nthe necessity to, \u201cacquire and maintain well-secured software components from\nverified commercial, open source, and other third-party developers\u201d -- which\nhas been the root cause of numerous high-profile supply chain attacks observed\nin the past few years, including the vulnerabilities included in Apache Log4j\nor Apache Struts,\u201d Plate says.\nMore broadly, Plate says the core principles for secure\nsoftware development, such as security by design and default, don\u2019t change\nregularly because they have been formulated in abstract terms to apply to a\nwide range of domains \u201cand remain agnostic of specific technologies.\u201d\nBut the CISA guidelines are still valuable, he notes, due to\nthe shared effort and joint communication of international government agencies,\n\u201cwhich shows broad alignment and agreement on the principles.\u201d\nThe fine print on safe products could prove to be tricky because\nit could be hard to prove.\n\u201cSoftware security differs from other software features and\nqualities because it\u2019s difficult to measure the level of security provided by a\ngiven software product or service,\u201d Plate explains. \u201cThis makes it hard for\ndevelopers and consumers to understand whether a given product or service is\nsecure \u2018enough\u2019 or more secure than that of another provider. Also, given\nenough time, effort and motivation, adversaries can compromise most of today\u2019s\nsoftware.\n\u201cIn other words, claims that a given software or service is\nsecure and does not have any vulnerabilities can hardly be proven by their\ndevelopers, and cannot be verified by software consumers.\u201d\nPlate says adds developers can only prove the presence of\ndefects during testing once they\u2019ve found a bug, but not their absence.\n\u201cThis particular feature of security can impact developers\u2019\nmotivation to work on security \u2013 as opposed to developing tangible features\nthat can be appreciated more directly by customers -- and customers\u2019\nwillingness to spend more for secure products that might have less features,\u201d\nhe says.\nChuck Brooks, president\nof Brooks Consulting International and a globally recognized expert in cybersecurity\nand emerging technologies, agrees the tenets for Secure By Design/Default have\nbeen around for a while, but the onus on the private sector to implement them\nhas been lacking.\n\u201cMoreover, the\nthreat landscape has changed,\u201d Brooks notes. \u201cSophisticated actors, including\nstate-sponsored, have enhanced their capabilities to exploit and breach via\nartificial intelligence and machine learning and sharing of threat tools, and\nbecause of geopolitical motivations.\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s not\nonly software developers that must their game, but also hardware developers -- as\nthe Internet of Things has become a major launching point by criminal hackers\ninto supply chains and for DDos attacks.\u201d\nBrooks doesn\u2019t\nagree the document is too aspirational, noting that much of the critical\ninfrastructure in the U.S. is being modernized, \u201cand there is an opportunity to\nput security as a priority in the renovations.\nBecause much of\nthe critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, Brooks\nsays it makes sense for CISA to push hard to get that sector to make\ninvestments.\n\u201cIn the long\nrun, it will take a close collaboration that includes cooperative R&D, and\ntechnology and threat sharing between the public and private sectors to better\nmitigate the cyber and physical threats from adversaries,\u201d he says.\n\u201cPassing laws\nwill eventually come into play, especially if there is a catastrophic breach\nthat harms national security. There is a learning curve in Congress on what the\nprudent path for both cybersecurity and emerging technologies entails. Some of\nthese directives by CISA are certainly spurring some cyber awareness among\nlegislators and industry.\u201d\nSome observers\nquestion whether the new guidelines will be enough to motivate software and\nhardware vendors to drive down risk.\nPlate says\nthose decisions should not be taken by individual developers. Secure software\nmust have buy-in from top management, be part of organizations\u2019 core values and\nbe reflected in corresponding policies and guidance, he notes.\n\u201cSecure\ndevelopment activities across the software development lifecycle consume\ndeveloper resources and impact the flow of features and functionality. The time\nspent by developers to implement security features or run security tests cannot\nbe used for developing the next fancy product feature,\u201d Plate says.\n\u201cAgain,\nthe nature of security, and the difficulty in measuring the level of security,\nmakes it hard to estimate whether a developer has done enough, or whether\nanother security test case or threat model will bring up a higher severity of vulnerability.\u201d\nBrooks\nbelieves a renewed focus on security in the development phase could slow down\ninnovation a bit, \u201cbut for others, particularly those involved in operating and\nprotecting critical infrastructure, it will make business sense,\u201d he says.\n\u201cColonial\nPipeline and Solar Winds, along with a whole host of recent visible breaches,\nshow that security needs to be operational and not just a revenue cost for\ncorporations and organizations -- or they may not stay in business or at least\noperate with tarnished reputations,\u201d Brooks says.\nAnother\nchallenge facing CISA\u2019s security guidelines is that code is constantly\nchanging, as are the users, attacks and technologies available, Plate says.\nSoftware\nengineering is often compared to other engineering disciplines like civil\nengineering, he says -- but one important difference is the threat landscape in\nsoftware development evolves constantly, \u201cwhile the risks stemming from, for\nexample, weather conditions that threaten the products of civil engineers such\nas bridges or buildings, are generally more stable over time. Moreover,\nattackers of IT infrastructure act intelligently.\u201d\nBrooks\nbelieves there are solutions to that.\n\u201cArtificial\nintelligence and machine learning have a significant role in enhancing threat\nmodeling capabilities, especially with automation,\u201d he says. \u201c In addition,\nsharing lessons learned on a global basis can help bring best practices to\ncoding, including with Open Source.\u201d\nCISA releases cybersecurity best practices for smart cities\nCISA and NSA release Enduring Security Framework Guidance on Identity and Access Management\nLatest in Cybersecurity\nThe anatomy of an innovative security program\nImmersive Labs expands executive leadership to drive cyber resilience"

The looming election and mounting threats set the stage for a high-stakes year, intensifying the urgency to decipher the unfolding landscape.\nToday, leading experts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) provide their insights on the coming year and speak to rising challenges including artificial intelligence, great power competition, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, and more.\nAll quotes may be used with attribution. To arrange an interview, please contact Alexa Whaley at awhaley@cnas.org.\nRichard Fontaine, Chief Executive Officer:\nAs 2024 begins, U.S. policymakers face their most challenging international environment in at least two decades. Russia stands to reap the benefits of any Western exhaustion with supporting Ukraine. Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, the Gaza war, and attacks by Iranian proxies threaten to spark wider violence across the Middle East. Furthermore, China wishes to absorb Taiwan and project influence everywhere, North Korea remains a weapons test away from crisis, Iran is just weeks from a nuclear breakout, and Venezuelan leaders talk openly about annexing their neighbor's territory. And this \u201cparade of horribles\u201d reflects only the crises we can identify \u2013 add to them one or two more that, while impossible to identify now, will no doubt appear sometime in 2024.\nThe growing Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis wishes to reshape the world in ways directly contrary to the values and interests we hold dear. Through a combination of military moves and threats, diplomatic engagements, and economic influence, these countries wish to enlarge the space available for statist autocracy and make the world less hospitable for democratic capitalism. As a result, the stakes are high, the need for U.S. and allied action significant, and the alternatives to our global leadership deeply unattractive.\nAmerican leaders need to set priorities. Support for Ukraine and Israel should continue. So too should the many moves to enhance the U.S. position in Asia and balance against rising Chinese power. These efforts will be difficult during a tumultuous election year. They are also necessary. Actions taken today are shaping the world in which we will live tomorrow.\nThe good news is that the United States and its partners have everything necessary to prevail in this contest of interests and ideals. It requires only the political will and cohesion to muster them in common cause. That's no easy task in a political year like 2024, but it is a vital one.\nPaul Scharre, Executive Vice President and Director of Studies:\nWith wars underway in Europe and the Middle East, the Biden administration\u2019s challenge will be to support America\u2019s partners while avoiding directly entangling the United States. The administration has been wisely restrained in responding to Russia\u2019s invasion, supplying Ukraine with the necessary arms to defend itself while avoiding some of the more dangerous proposals pushed by hawks at the start of the war that would have risked direct U.S. involvement. The Biden administration will need to similarly manage the difficult task of supporting Israel, while keeping the United States distanced from the war. With the United States striking back at Iranian proxies and Hezbollah and Israel trading fire across the Lebanese border, the Administration must be careful not to allow the United States to get drawn into a wider regional conflict.As election season heats up, it will be a reminder of just how low foreign policy is on the agenda for most Americans. The American people are tired of wars and foreign entanglements. Yet America remains indispensable around the world, not just in Europe and the Middle East but perhaps most critically in Asia, where American power and diplomacy are needed to counter a rising China. National security policymakers will need to navigate these twin realities\u2014the necessity of American involvement overseas and the pull of isolationism at home\u2014to craft policies that advance America\u2019s interests while avoiding overcommitment. Already, Republican opposition to supporting Ukraine is jeopardizing further U.S. aid. Nearly half of Republicans think the United States is giving too much aid to Ukraine. The calamitous outcome of the Afghanistan withdrawal is a reminder of what happens when U.S. policymakers pursue an agenda that is too ambitious for what the American people are willing to support. Eventually, they\u2019ll elect a President who will simply pull the plug. American engagement is needed in the world; for that engagement to succeed, it must be sustainable.\nCarrie Cordero, General Counsel and Robert M Gates Senior Fellow:\n2024 will stress test whether the rule of law and institutional protections applied since the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol will hold, or whether a toxic concoction of political divisiveness, a fractured domestic information environment, and an increasing domestic threat landscape will give way to political violence. The last U.S. presidential election did not result in a peaceful transfer of power. Instead, inflammatory political rhetoric combined with a legal strategy to alter the election outcome, the existence of domestic violent extremist groups willing to engage and lead other citizens in violence, and insufficient law enforcement preparedness resulted in deaths, injuries, and a delay of the election certification. Since then, the U.S. Department of Justice has prosecuted hundreds of individuals for participation in the attack on the U.S. Capitol from charges ranging from trespass to seditious conspiracy. The Special Counsel has charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States, among other charges, in connection with an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election. The District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, has charged numerous individuals in connection with election interference efforts. Each of these cases has strengths and weaknesses; and the outcome of the pending cases is anything but certain. Against this backdrop of unresolved legal accountability for the events of the past election looms the coming presidential election. The 2024 presidential campaign takes place in an environment of persistent domestic threats against public officials of all political parties and at all levels: local, state and federal, elected officials, judges, civil servants and even volunteers; Republicans and Democrats. This increasing atmosphere of political violence manifests through swatting incidents, online harassment, and threats of physical harm. In large part, the proper functioning of the 2024 U.S. election will depend on the ability of the campaigns and election itself to proceed in an environment free of violence. The 2022 midterm election cycle was able to proceed relatively peacefully. This year, the freedom and safety with which candidates can campaign, election administrators can do their jobs, court personnel can handle the ongoing election related cases, and voters can vote may provide the strongest indicator as to whether U.S. democracy will emerge from the stress test in good shape.\nVivek Chilukuri, Senior Fellow and Director, Technology and National Security Program:\nIn 2024, the global conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) will shift from broad speculation about risks to the nitty gritty of governance. In the United States, AI governance will mature even as legislation from Congress remains highly unlikely in an election year. Federal agencies will primarily drive AI governance as they meet a thicket of deadlines from the Biden administration\u2019s AI Executive Order. For example, the Order directs agencies to develop best practices for AI safety and security, issue guidelines for responsible AI use in areas like law enforcement, health care, and education, and require companies developing the most advanced AI models to share their safety measures and red-team test results. We can also expect states to fill the void of federal AI laws, just as we\u2019ve seen with privacy policy. At least twelve states have already passed laws to ensure AI developers comply with minimal rules and standards governing AI, and three have laws protecting citizens from algorithmic discrimination. At the same time, AI copyright cases will continue to wind their way through federal courts, with far-reaching consequences for the future training, application, and profitability of advanced AI models.Abroad, other nations will continue to set the pace for AI governance\u2014allowing U.S. policymakers to learn from successes and missteps, but also risking U.S. leadership in shaping global AI standards. The EU AI Act still has a few procedural hurdles to clear, but this year should see the EU\u2019s first prohibitions against AI applications that pose \u201cunacceptable risks\u201d take effect, such as social scoring and untargeted scraping of facial images. China, which already has three AI regulations governing algorithmic recommendations, synthetic content, and generative AI, could also expedite its policy process and announce a more comprehensive AI Law. The efforts underway will help bring the lofty AI debates of 2023 down to earth this year, as governments and industry grapple with the more humdrum realities of regulation, reporting, and implementation.\nLisa Curtis, Senior Fellow and Director, Indo-Pacific Security Program:\nThe recent restoration of military-to-military communications between the United States and China could portend calmer overall relations between the two nations in the year ahead. Beijing\u2019s decision to resume military talks may indeed reflect its desire to avoid any crisis with the United States during the U.S. presidential election campaign season. Still, Taiwan will remain a major source of friction between Washington and Beijing, and this Saturday\u2019s election in Taiwan adds a layer of uncertainty to the situation. Additionally, brewing tensions between China and United States\u2019 treaty ally, the Philippines, over a small Philippines\u2019 outpost in the South China Sea could also throw a spanner in the works, especially if there is an incident involving loss of life due to Chinese maritime aggression. The Biden administration is likely to continue building on progress made in nurturing alliances and partnerships throughout the Indo-Pacific region last year, a critical element of establishing deterrence in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will soon visit the White House again\u2014this time for a state-level visit. The Biden administration will further continue to prioritize relations with India, despite facing one of the biggest challenges to bilateral ties in the last decade with the uncovering of an Indian plot to assassinate a Sikh activist in the United States. The Biden administration\u2019s continued commitment to building closer defense and security ties with India demonstrates the importance President Biden attaches to India\u2019s role in stabilizing and securing the Indo-Pacific. The recent large-scale terrorist attack in Tehran conducted by the Afghanistan-based Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) will shake up that region in unexpected ways and lead to more concerted efforts in Washington to prevent a similar attack by the Sunni extremist group against western targets. The attack highlights the perils of ignoring Afghanistan and the witch\u2019s brew of terrorist groups operating there. The Taliban fights ISKP, but their support for other terrorist groups and atrocious treatment of women and girls fosters a supportive eco-system for extremist ideologies and terrorism to thrive. The Biden administration must step up its game in Afghanistan and develop a strategy with like-minded partners that both heads off the terrorist threat and blunts extremist ideologies, many of which are fostered by the Taliban leadership itself.\nAndrea Kendall-Taylor, Senior Fellow and Director, Transatlantic Security Program:\nThe Transatlantic community should buckle up for 2024, as it is bound to be a turbulent year. Ukraine will remain on the defensive for much of the year, with its ability to sustain its defensive lines hinging critically on the will of the West\u2014and especially the United States\u2014to sustain its economic and military support. Russian President Putin is riding confidently into the new year, and because he likely sees 2024 as pivotal, he will increase pressure not just on the frontlines in Ukraine but on our democratic societies. Getting former President Trump elected may very well top his New Year\u2019s resolutions. The Allies have an opportunity to make the 75th NATO Summit in Washington a truly historic one, but so far, there is little to suggest that it will be remarkable. Meanwhile, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East will continue to polarize publics and electorates, paving the way for far-right parties and leaders to gain traction. Even if a far-right wave in Europe is unlikely, the uptick in support for these parties will re-shape political agendas and impede the effective functioning of European institutions at a time that Europe can ill afford it. And although the Transatlantic alliance is stronger now than ever, so too is the cooperation between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. 2024 may well be remembered as the year that this axis of upheaval fully coalesced, bringing with it the turmoil and conflict that would entail. \u202f There is plenty of potential that 2024 could outperform this gloomy forecast. In fact, the most critical factors shaping the transatlantic trajectory in 2024 are decisions that Americans and Europeans will themselves make. Will we sustain aid to and support for Ukraine? And who will we elect to office? A series of the right decisions could lead 2024 to turn out alright, and actually set the stage for a more promising 2025.\nEmily Kilcrease, Senior Fellow and Director, Energy, Economics, and Security Program:\nEconomic security themes will be top of mind for policymakers in 2024, with concerns about China and Russia dominating the conversation. If the administration is serious about addressing national security risks associated with outbound investment, expect to see final regulations for its proposal to regulate U.S. investments in China in the critical chips, AI, and quantum sectors. These same sectors will be central to export control work in 2024, including the question of whether to impose new controls on Chinese companies\u2019 access to U.S. cloud computing services. The trade agenda is likely to wither away in 2024. Having failed to secure agreement on the trade pillar of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework at the November APEC Summit, the United States missed a critical moment to finalize the deal in advance of the U.S. presidential elections. Further progress looks unlikely. Instead, expect trade debates in 2024 to focus less on affirmative initiatives with partners and allies and more on defending U.S. economic interests from China. A recent report from the the House Select Committee on the CCP set the scene, with far-reaching recommendations on revoking China's privileges under the World Trade Organization. At the same time, the Biden administration may finally finish its review of the 301 tariffs imposed under the Trump administration, and policymakers are considering whether tariffs can address rising concerns over China\u2019s growing market share in electric vehicles and legacy chips. These debates over tariffs will heat up in 2024, though whether anything will be implemented remains uncertain. On the Russia front, work will continue apace to tighten sanctions and export controls, while addressing stubborn concerns over evasion. Western electronics continue to find their way onto the battlefield in Ukraine, despite purportedly strict export control regimes to prevent this. In addition to continued enforcement efforts, the sanctioning countries may need to take a hard look at whether western suppliers are doing enough to ensure that their products are not aiding the Russian military machine.\nKatherine Kuzminski, Deputy Director of Studies and Director, Military, Veterans, and Society Program:\nThe Department of Defense and the military services invested significant resources and attention to process improvements for military recruitment over the last two years, which now promise to pay dividends and turn the tide on the military recruitment crisis in 2024. New approaches to training, selecting, and incentivizing uniformed recruiters have the potential to increase recruiter effectiveness. Strategies mobilizing current service members, such as the Air Force\u2019s We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) program, align incentives across the force and encourage those currently serving to communicate the value of service to their hometown communities. Programs aiding potential recruits to meet military standards, such as the Army\u2019s Future Soldier Prep Course, provide pipelines of new candidates who previously would have been disqualified from service. Reimagined recruiting campaigns based on updated market research make the case for military service for a new generation. DoD and military department examinations of and experiments with the ways in which standards can evolve without affecting the quality of initial recruits, such as modernized body composition standards, relaxed tattoo policies, and increased age limits, expand their access to individuals who have a propensity to serve.\nHowever, even as the military services reap the benefits of their years of effort in 2024, it will also be important that they maintain momentum. Moreover, it will be vital that they are supported by a whole-of-government effort to elevate military service as a compelling option for American youth. In order to counter misperceptions of military service, leadership from the White House and bipartisan coalitions in Congress and across statehouses will be a necessary to bridge the civil-military divide and introduce the next generation to the calling of military service.\nJonathan Lord, Senior Fellow and Director, Middle East Security Program:\nIn 2024, the ongoing Israel-Hamas War will continue to reverberate throughout the Middle East, and America\u2019s Middle East policy. As the United States approaches a very consequential presidential election this November, the Biden administration will attempt to write a positive third act to this dark chapter of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Biden believes a pathway to a two-state solution must follow the ongoing war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu categorically does not. While disparate visions between Biden and Bibi likely mean a permanent peace agreement is not forthcoming, pressing policy questions in need of more immediate answers this year persist.\nArguably more important than debating \u201cthe day after,\u201d there continues to be no discernible plan for \u201cthe day in between.\u201d A credible and professional military force is needed to provide security, services, and increased aid to Gazans for the foreseeable future\u2014as it will take considerable time to clear the rubble, unexploded ordnance, and to rebuild homes and communities destroyed in the conflict. Unless President Biden can wrangle Israel, Palestinians, regional Arab, and international partners and allies into hammering out a costly, but critically-necessary interim mechanism to stabilize the lives of two million displaced and vulnerable Palestinians, the conditions in Gaza will deteriorate further, making a durable cessation of hostilities ephemeral, and conditions for lasting peace elusive. But absent U.S. leadership and presence on the ground, will any other nation step into the breach? Likely not, and thus far, no administration official has dared suggest U.S. forces play such a central role in yet another Middle East conflict.\nOpening up the aperture to the broader region, Iran\u2019s proxies and partners have opportunistically used the Israel-Hamas War to drive the Middle East into a state of chaos. While the Biden administration has addressed the threats posed by militias in Iraq and Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen in isolation, and with remedies of varying levels of military aggression, seemingly absent is a coherent policy that meaningfully holds accountable or implicates the source of all this mayhem: Iran. If President Biden cannot articulate a plan of action to more directly and aggressively confront Iran for its role in enabling these regional agents of terror in the Middle East soon, expect to hear about it on the campaign trail and on the debate stage this fall.\nIn 2024, we should also expect to see the ominous continuation of the Iranian regime\u2019s effort to expand its military capabilities and its economic resilience by forging stronger ties with Russia, China, and North Korea. It is here that the Biden administration should seek opportunities to further animate and utilize America\u2019s own partnerships and alliances in each theater of operation where this developing axis poses greater threats. While President Biden drew some linkages to the array of threats posed to the United States and its allies when arguing for a defense budget supplemental bill this past October, he should consider a revamped National Defense Strategy that more explicitly links the threats posed by revisionist powers and addresses them head-on.\nStacie Pettyjohn, Senior Fellow and Director, Defense Program:\nThe greatest challenge for the U.S. Department of Defense in 2024 is managing the iron triangle, or the tradeoffs among resources, force structure, and readiness, for current and future threats. The Biden administration enters its final year with two ongoing conflicts\u2014Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza Conflict\u2014which have required U.S. military aid, additional force deployments, and senior leader attention. At the same time, China\u2019s revisionism, growing conventional and nuclear arsenal, and stated intent to unify with Taiwan, poses a long-term challenge to regional security and the U.S.-led international order. Ensuring that the United States can respond to ongoing simultaneous challenges while still preserving the resources and readiness and develop the right force structure to meet future threats is a tall order.\nThere are initial signs that the out-of-cycle deployments to Europe and the Middle East intended to deter adversaries and reassure allies and partners are eroding readiness, leaving forces less prepared for the future fights they may face. Additionally, the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB) has already felt the squeeze as it has scrambled to re-arm Ukraine and Israel with 155mm rounds and air defense missiles. DIB deficiencies have heightened the tension between producing more of what is currently needed and the long-range munitions that may be required in a potential future conflict with China. The resourcing challenge is even more stark when the stockpile depth required for protracted conflict is considered. Beyond the traditional DIB, the Pentagon continues to struggle to tap into commercial industry and non-traditional defense companies, and identify how to leverage existing authorities to more rapidly field at scale emerging technologies.\nA key test of whether the Pentagon can really move fast is the Replicator initiative, the Deputy of Secretary of Defense\u2019s plan to acquire thousands of attritable drones in two years to counter China. But Replicator raises broader questions about priorities for future force structure. Should the United States optimize its force and produce high numbers of low-cost attritable drones? Or is this big bet merely extrapolating a lesson learned from Ukraine and applying it erroneously to future operating environments, like the Indo-Pacific? Forthcoming CNAS defense program research sheds light on how drones have been employed in Ukraine and how they could impact a future U.S.-China war over Taiwan.\nThe bill for the long overdue modernization of American nuclear forces is also coming at the same time that the Pentagon is attempting to upgrade its conventional forces. This further complicates the competition for resources as the Department considers the conventional-nuclear force mix that meets the changing strategic balance and considers how to simultaneously deter two nuclear armed great powers and manage escalation in the context of a conventional war.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has tough choices to make in 2024. It will need to make the right decisions within the delicate balance of the iron triangle about how to deter threats in the present without under preparing for the demands of future warfare. At the same time, the Pentagon needs to figure out how to strengthen its industrial base and more quickly acquire new technologies. Managing risk over time is perhaps the greatest challenge for any administration and only time will tell whether the Biden administration will get it right in 2024.\nAll CNAS experts are available for interviews.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

The annual must-pass legislation for US military funding is now headed to President Biden for his signature.\nPartisan fights over defense spending for Ukraine and controversies over women\u2019s health care and gender-affirming rights generated a lot of headlines in the months leading up to the bill\u2019s passage. Most of the hardline culture war provisions were ultimately stripped out of the final legislative package and much of the Ukraine funding is still mired in debate. The bill also contained a stop-gap four-month reauthorization of the controversial Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enables the US government to spy on foreign nationals, and sometimes US citizens and residents, which was due to expire at year-end.\nAs is typical for all annual NDAAs, this year\u2019s 3,000-plus page legislation is filled with many large and small cybersecurity-related provisions. The following sections summarize some of the more consequential cybersecurity provisions in the Act.\nBoosting nuclear weapons and systems cybersecurity\nFollowing a concerted push by a group of bipartisan House lawmakers, the NDAA creates within the Department of Defense a \u201ccybersecurity risk inventory, assessment, and mitigation working group\u201d charged with developing a comprehensive strategy for identifying nuclear weapons information technology environments facing cybersecurity risks and implementing risk mitigation actions.\nThe bill also directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a cross-functional team to develop and oversee the implementation of a threat-driven cyber defense construct for the systems and networks that support the nuclear command, control, and communications, commonly called the NC3 mission. This team will comprise personnel from all the military departments, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the National Security Agency, the United States Cyber Command, the United States Strategic Command, and any other organization or element of the Department of Defense determined appropriate by the Secretary.\nNDAA focus on artificial intelligence\nConsistent with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and the still uncertain impact these new systems will have on military operations and foreign diplomacy, the NDAA contains major sections that give the Pentagon and US State Department several new AI-related responsibilities.\nThe bill establishes a Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer Governing Council for the military to provide policy oversight to ensure the responsible, coordinated, and ethical employment of data and artificial intelligence capabilities across Department of Defense (DOD) operations and missions. The Department\u2019s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer (CDAO) will head the Council.\nAmong the many duties assigned to the CDAO under the bill are cybersecurity-related tasks, including:\nThe bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic plan for the development, use, and cybersecurity of generative artificial intelligence, including a policy governing the use of, and the defense against, adversarial use of, generative artificial intelligence. It further requires the Defense Secretary to complete a study \u201cto assess the functionality of artificial intelligence-enabled military applications, research and development needs related to such applications, and vulnerabilities to the privacy, security, and accuracy of such applications.\u201d\nIn terms of the State Department, the bill establishes an office of a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, who will, among other things, act as the principal advisor to the Secretary of State on the ethical use of AI and advanced analytics in conducting data-informed diplomacy. It also establishes a program, the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership, and promotes best practices and common standards for a national approach to cybersecurity.\nThe bill further establishes in the State Department a cyberspace, digital connectivity, and related technologies (CDT) fund to advance a secure and stable cyberspace by, among other things, helping countries prepare for, defend against, and respond to malicious cyber activities and adopt national strategies to enhance cybersecurity.\nOther noteworthy NDAA cybersecurity provisions\nOf the many other provisions in the NDAA that mention cybersecurity, the following are worth noting:\nRelated content\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nCynthia Brumfield is a veteran communications and technology analyst who is currently focused on cybersecurity.
