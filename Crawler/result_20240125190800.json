Tested at 12.7 cm on hard non-porous surfaces.\u00a0 In testing at 6.5 cm on hard non-porous surfaces, UVCeed was shown to reduce SARS CoV2 by 99.99% in 64 seconds.\nWhen antibacterial wipes were introduced in 2000 they where revolutionary for their time \u2014 but they have many challenges.\nNot all wipes kill viruses\nPotential to spread pathogens from one surface to another\nCannot be used on all surfaces or fabrics\nWipes vs. UVCeed*\nUVCeed is a disinfecting* device with a downloadable app for your phone.\nThe device attaches magnetically to the back of your phone. (Magsafe phones are ready to go. Older models are provided a metal plate that will attach to your phone or phone case.)\nThe device pairs wirelessly to the app. The app uses the phone\u2019s camera to recognize objects and calculate distance and energy.\nOnce UVCeed is set up, all you need to do is point the phone camera at the object and hold the treat button on the app down. The UVCeed device then activates the non-visible UVC light. The UVCeed app will let you know how far to hold the phone from the object and will let you know when the object has been disinfected*.\nUVCeed was invented by an orthopedic surgeon and an engineer. With six kids and two dogs, Dr. Peter Bonutti wanted the ability to disinfect items as easily as he did in the OR. As a physician he understood the limitations of wipes and wanted to harness the power of UVC light.\nWorking alongside his friend and engineer, Justin Beyers, they applied machine learning and artificial intelligence to build the first UVC disinfecting* device that can be used anywhere, anytime.\nDr. Peter Bonutti, M.D., Co-Founder & CEO\nDr. Bonutti is a surgeon, inventor, author, professor, consultant, and entrepreneur with over 30 years of experience. He is the founder of Bonutti Research, a medical device incubator that has developed products and technology used around the world and maintains his clinical and surgical practice, which focuses on knee and hip arthroplasty and integration of robotics into surgical procedures.\nDr. Bonutti is a pioneer in Minimally Invasive Surgery, has over 500 patents and applications and has developed more than 700 licenses and multiple FDA-approved products to-date.\nMajor corporations leveraging his technology include: Hitachi, Medtronic, Kyphon, Covidien, US Surgical, Biomet, Arthrocare, Synthes, Zimmer/Biomet and Stryker.\nHe is a prolific speaker, lecturing internationally, and has trained over 100 surgeons on his surgical techniques. In his career, Dr. Bonutti has received more than a dozen industry honors and awards for his achievements.\nEducation:\nDr. Bonutti earned his medical degree at University of Cincinnati College ofMedicine and completed his Orthopaedic Surgery Residency at Cleveland ClinicFoundation with international fellowships in Canada, Australia, and Austria.\nJustin Beyers, Co-Founder\nJustin has nearly 20 years of experience designing and manufacturing medical devices including ultrasonics, orthopedic, neuromodulation and ENT.\nIn addition to UVCeed, Justin serves as director of research and development at the medical device company Realeve and at Bonutti Research, a medical device incubator that has developed products and technology used around the world.\nEarlier in his career, Justin served as electrical engineer at Motorola where he was a member of the design and manufacturing team for General Motors\u2019 OnStar System.\nJustin is named as an inventor on 100 applications, 35+ patents, and multiple publications. He holds a BSE in computer engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago.\nBonutti Technologies was founded in 1990 by Dr. Peter Bonutti to develop medical technologies to improve health care. Located in Effingham, Illinois, Bonnutti technologies has over 400 patents, more than 750 licenses and employees a skilled team of engineers. \u00a0Dr. Peter Bonutti pioneered minimally invasive knee surgery and still practices. He is also a prolific inventor, and a respected advisor to the medical device industry.\nVisit the Bonutti Technologies website\nTo learn more about opportunities to invest in UVCeed, please reach out to us."
