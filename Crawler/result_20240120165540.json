        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

One that caught ZDNET's resident robot vacuum expert's eye is the Dreame X30 robot vacuum and mop. This robot vacuum features an anti-tangle feature that cuts any hair that may be tangled in the brush rollers.\n\"The cutting heads are carefully positioned to do this, carefully tucking away the heads to ensure that your floors and carpets aren't scratched as the robot moves along,\" according to ZDNET's Beth Mauder.\nAside from this feature, the Dreame X30 features 8000Pa of suction power, dual oscillating mop heads, and automatic carpet detection to lift its mop pads up to 10.5mm. It's available for preorder at the early bird special of $1,240, down from its $1,700 retail price.\nHonorable mentions\nOther brands like Roborock and Ecovacs also launched new products at CES 2024. Roborock launched a new S8 Max series of robot vacuums and mops available in April 2024, including S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra, both of which will feature an alternative refill and drainage system that connects to a home's water supply.\nEcovacs also announced a new variant of the Deebot X2 Omni, the Deebot X2 Combo, available at the end of March for $1,599. This variant makes the Omni station, where the robot vacuum docks to empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, also function as a charging dock for a new Ecovacs handheld stick vacuum.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\nBest energy management solutions\nEcoFlow stole the home energy spotlight at CES 2024 with the launch of its largest portable battery to date, the Delta Pro Ultra. Combined with an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2, the DPU inverter and battery combination can also serve as a home backup system that can be charged with AC, solar, or gas generators.\nThe introductory price of $4,999 buys the Delta Pro Ultra with 6kWh capacity, and users can stack up to five batteries under each inverter, combining up to three inverters with one Smart Home Panel for a total of 90kWh.\nHonorable mentions\nImpressive features aside, EcoFlow isn't the only company showcasing energy solutions at CES. Savant demoed a new Power Storage System, a smart panel and backup solution that works with the Savant professional app to help users save money on energy costs by switching from grid to backup easily.\nAnker also officially launched the Solix F3800 for sale after a successful Kickstarter campaign, as well as a smaller portable battery, the Anker Solix C800 Plus.\nLockly Visage Facial Recognition Smart Lock\nBest for home security\nImagine coming home with arms full of grocery bags and being able to unlock your door by simply facing it, as if it knows exactly who you are, because it does. Lockly launched a new residential smart lock that supports facial recognition technology, the Lockly Visage.\nThis is even more convenient than using a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key to unlock your door -- \u00a0but don't worry, the Lockly Visage also supports both of those options for unlocking. And if you're still feeling old school, you can also unlock it with a keypad or physical key.\nThis Matter-enabled smart lock will be available this summer for $349.\nHonorable mentions\nSmart home brand Abode also launched a new Wi-Fi HaLow camera with an ultra-long transmission range of over 1.5 miles. The battery-powered Abode Edge Camera could be placed anywhere on your property and never lose internet connection, as long as it's within 1.5 miles of your router. The Abode Edge Camera will launch later in Q1 for $200.\nPhilips also launched a new 5000 Series smart lock with palm recognition technology that lets users unlock their doors without touching them. This lock also has a doorbell button on the front and comes with a chime in the box that remains plugged in inside the home.\nPanasonic delivers AI assistance\nBest in smart appliances\nCES 2024's AI theme collided with the smart home, as Panasonic announced a new collaboration with Fresco, a smart kitchen platform leader, to introduce an advanced cooking AI assistant for Panasonic kitchen appliances. This will begin with the new Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 multi-oven.\nThe AI assistant will be able to customize recipes based on dietary preferences and restrictions, ingredient substitutions based on what's available in your pantry, and adjustments of serving sizes and cooking settings.\nHonorable mentions\nRevolution Cooking's new Macrowave Oven is the perfect replacement for a microwave, air fryer, countertop oven, and broiler in one. This device is smart enough to do it all: it seamlessly switches between microwaving leftovers and air-frying wings with the touch of an LCD screen. It comes with a sturdy price tag of $1,800 however.\nBoth Samsung and LG took to CES to showcase their new all-in-one washer and dryer combos, complete with AI integrations to optimize laundry cycles and reduce energy use.\nSeveral companies also showcased new tech for the furriest family members at home, including the Sevvy Smart cooker, Hisense Smart Built-in Dishwasher with Autodose and AutoDry, an RCA automatic pet feeder and a Smart Bird Feeder, Tineco Floor ONE S7 combo floor cleaner, among many others.\nThe best smart home robots\nSamsung revamped Ballie, its home robot companion, which failed to take off after being showcased at CES 2020. Ballie is a round smart home hub that can patrol your home using its built-in camera, and its built-in projector can project images on walls, floors, and ceilings.\nAlso: Samsung adds new SmartThings features, including Map View\nEcovacs launched a new model of its window cleaning model that can reach new places. The Winbot W2 Omni comes with a portable station that carries a battery so you can use it to clean windows inside and out.\nBeabot is launching a new AquaSense Pro robot pool cleaner that can clean not only floors and walls but also the water surface and clarify water. It's available for pre-order at $1,699.\nRobot lawnmowers:\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe best headphones of CES 2024 so far\nFrom indoor solar to light-based internet, photonics offers a brighter future"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best smart home tech of CES 2024: fresh ideas from Philips, Samsung and more\nOur favorite smart home tech of CES 2024\nSmart home tech has long been a mainstay of the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013\u00a0and that's proven to be the case again at CES 2024. From sci-fi smart locks to more eccentric ideas like AI pillows, the show offers a glimpse of some of the tech flourishes that could be heading to your home this year.\nAfter dashing around the CES show floor and almost indecently exposing ourselves in Kohler's new smart showers, we've rounded up all of the announcements that are worthing knowing about here. Some of the headlines include next-gen smart locks, digital shower systems, and speakers that are disguised as picture frames.\nStill, those are just the start of some of the smart home innovations we've stumbled across at the world's biggest tech show. Elsewhere, we've also tripped over some impressive robot vacuums from the likes of Roborock and Matic. Naturally, there have also been some stranger ideas like the anti-snoring pillow.\nLooking to spruce up your home with some new tech this year? Here's our pick of the CES 2024's best smart home offerings so far.\nSmart security\nLockly Visage\nIn the age of Face ID if feels pretty backwards to still be shoving a metal key into our front doors to unlock them, but that could soon change. Lockly's new Visage smart lock ($349, around \u00a3275 / AU$520) has built-in facial recognition and can replace your traditional deadbolt.\nIf you'd rather not go quite that futuristic, the Visage will also support Apple HomeKey when it gets Matter certification, letting you unlock your front door by tapping your iPhone or Apple Watch on the lock or using Siri commands. It's due to go on sale in the US this summer, with international availability yet to be announced.\nPhilips Wi-Fi Palm Recognition Smart Deadbolt\nIf you don't fancy using the Lockly Visage's face recognition to unlock your door, Philips had an interesting alternative at CES 2024 \u2013 the first smart lock with palm recognition.\nThe catchily-named Philips Wi-Fi Palm Recognition Smart Deadbolt ($359, around \u00a3285 / AU$535) works by detecting your unique palm vein pattern, which Philips says gives it \"unparalleled security\", and can store up to 50 of these palm patterns.\nThe lock also works with Alexa or Google Assistant, so you can check on its status with voice commands, and it acts as a doorbell, too. The sci-fi accessory will be going on sale in the \"first half of 2024\" in the US, though no international launch has been confirmed.\nSmart home accessories\nKohler Anthem Plus\nKohler's 'digital showering' concept sounds like a recipe for electrocution, but we were mighty impressed with its Anthem+ Digital Control and System (starts at $2,800, around \u00a32,200 / AU$4180) at CES 2024. It promises to serve up a multi-sensory showering experience that lets you customize the water, light, sound, and even the\u00a0steam.\nThe controller mounts on a wall and has a touch-sensitive interface that lets you control most different shower types and also tweak the spray zones, if you're lucky enough to have one with those powers.\nNaturally, it also connects to the Kohler Konnect app, which gives you voice control via Alexa and Google Home, and launches in February 2024. Frankly, there's a danger we might never leave the shower, so it's probably a good thing that it's so expensive.\nMotion Pillow\nAn AI-powered pillow might sound like tech overstepping the mark, but bear with us \u2013\u00a0what if we said it might stop you or your partner from snoring? That's the pitch behind the Motion Pillow ($420, around \u00a3330 / AU$630), which picked up a CES 2024 innovation award.\nThis inflatable pillow (don't worry, it's made of memory foam, like many of today's best pillows) is joined by a Motion System Unit, which identifies snoring sounds and will slowly inflate the offending person's pillow. This gently turns their head to the side, opening their airways to create some peace.\nThe companion app also handily gives you insights into your sleep as well as letting you adjusting settings, and the Motion Pillow is available to buy now (with a special CES 2024 discount).\nSamsung Music Frame\nLike the IKEA and Sonos collaboration that produced the Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker, Samsung has made an invisible speaker than can secretly pump out your tunes from behind your choice of photo or art.\nWhile it's a shame there's no digital screen like the best digital photo frames, the Music Frame can act as either a standalone Bluetooth or Wi-Fi speaker, or as part of your home theater setup as a TV speaker, rear speaker or subwoofer.\nIn some ways, the idea is great \u2013 it's a space-saving bit of kit that hides technology from sight, which is what all the best smart home kit should do. But as TechRadar's Senior Audio Staff Writer Becky Scarrott argues below, it also breaks almost every rule of building of a good audio setup. There's no word on pricing or availability yet, but when the Music Frame does arrive, it's probably going to divide opinion.\nSmart lighting\nNanoleaf Essential Matter series\nNanoleaf makes some of the best smart lights around and it again lit up CES 2024 with a trio of announcements \u2013\u00a0including its first outdoor lights.\nIts Essential Matter series consists of three models, with two of them being string lights that are designed to bring mood lighting to your back yard or balcony to create mood lighting. Nanoleaf's Permanant Lights, meanwhile, are designed for tricky-to-reach areas on your house like above windows. They're all due out in Spring, though there's no pricing yet.\nThat wasn't the end of Nanoleaf's announcements, though. Arguably the most interesting is that the Nanoleaf Skylight (above), which it announced back at CES 2023, is finally available for pre-order on\u00a0Nanoleaf\u2019s website for $250 (a three-pack) with an Expansion Pack available for $70, with shipping in late January 2024.\nGovee AI Lighting Bot\nWe're currently pretty obsessed with Govee's Curtain Lights and the brand has now previewed a new AI-powered way to interact with its smart lights at CES 2024.\nCalled the AI Lighting Bot, the system is currently in its early development, but promises to give you a chatbot assistant that answers natural language requests (for example \"I want a Christmas effect\") and save you from manual smart light tweaking.\nWhile that sounds interesting, its two less nebulous announcements could have a bigger impact on your lighting in 2024. The Sync Box Kit 2 is designed for gamers who want lights that react to on-screen action and combines an RGB strip, two light towers and an HDMI box.\nThe Neon Rope Light 2, meanwhile, is a flexible smart light that can bend and flex to your desired shape and be modified using its companion app. Both the Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 are due out in the first half of 2024, but unfortunately there's no pricing yet.\nXGIMI Aladdin\nAnother example of smart home tech that disappears into the background of your home, the XGIMI Aladdin is a ceiling light that's also secretly a projector and a Bluetooth speaker.\nWhile it isn't part of any smart home platforms like Matter, the Aladdin is still worthy of a place in this list because we're bigs fans of invisible, versatile home tech. It plugs into your existing light socket and can project a 1080p image that's up to 100 inches in size.\nNothing to worry the best projectors, then, but ideal for a quick movie in a bedroom, and you also get 360-degree sound from its built-in Harmon Kardon speakers. There's no price or release date for the Aladdin yet, but the Japanese model it's based on retails for \u00a5129,800 (which is around $895 / \u00a3700 / AU$1,330).\nRobot vacuums\nRoborock S8 Max Series\niRobot and Eufy currently dominate our guide to the best robot vacuums, but Roborock announced some new contenders at CES 2024 that could shake things up \u2013\u00a0its new S8 Max Series.\nThe high-end robo-vacs come with a new \"high-speed sonic mopping\" system and some serious suction power. The S8 Max promises 8,000Pa (pascals) of power, while the higher-end promises 10,000Pa \u2013 considering that standard vacuum cleaners offer between 2,500-3,000Pa, both promise to give your floors a thorough clean.\nInterestingly, both models also have a little robo-arm with a brush and mop that can reach into trickier spots. The pricier S8 MaxV model (costing $1,800, around \u00a31,415 / AU$2,690) has AI for better obstacle avoidance plus a voice assistant, but if you don't those then the S8 Max might be better bet for $1,600 (\u00a31,260 / AU$2,395). Both will be available in April 2024 in the US, with no international launch announced yet.\nMatic robot vacuum\nThe Matic Robot vacuum isn't brand new, having launched with a subscription model in early 2023. But it has effectively relaunched at CES 2024 \u2013 now being available for a pretty hefty standalone price of $1,795 (or $1,595 right now) \u2013\u00a0and does promise to fix a few of the common pitfalls with the little autonomous helpers.\nOne of those is the privacy concerns that some of us understandably have about a robot mapping our homes. To assuage those concerns, the Matic has no cloud connection and keeps its mapping stored locally, while limited its connection to smart home systems like Alexa or Google Home.\nThe Matic also promises to be better than your average robo-vac when it comes to dodging obstacles in your home, thanks to its five RGB cameras, and it also combines both mopping and vacuuming powers. With gesture commands and a relatively quiet 55db operating noise, it certainly sounds like a dirt-busting powerhouse \u2013 which you'd hope for the price.\nEcovacs Winbot W2 Omni\nIt's not a robot vacuum, but Ecovacs has made this next-gen version of its robotic window cleaner, which could be a higher priority for you depending on the state of your glass. It promises to bring a host of improvements over the original Winbot X (which arrived at CES 2018), including superior navigation and better hardware for edge-to-edge cleaning.\nThe robot's climbing system has powerful anti-slip slip and, crucially, anti-dust driving treads to help it avoid ruining the cleaning work it's just done. It's compatible with most window types, including floor-to-ceiling windows and even mirrors. Ecovacs didn't announce any pricing or a release date for the Winbot W2 Omni, but as a guide the current version costs $339 (around \u00a3265 / AU$505).\nHome batteries\nEcoflow Delta Pro Ultra\nWith blackouts and power outages becoming as common as extreme weather events, home batteries that are effectively giant smartphone power banks are becoming more popular \u2013\u00a0and the Ecoflow Delta Pro Ultra is one of the best, and most versatile, so far.\nThe Delta Pro Ultra can be used as both an emergency backup and also a (relatively) portable battery for all of your daily or EV needs. With a power capacity of 6kWh and a 7200W output (plus 5.6kW of solar input), it's capable of powering your whole home, or intelligently offsetting your daily energy costs. It'll also give your EV a handy top-up and you can stack multiple batteries, too.\nBut the Delta Pro Ultra can also be detached from its Smart Home Panel 3 based and wheeled around on its base to wherever you need a power. It has tons of outlets, including two with USB-C, two more with USB-A, four standard 120V outputs and more.\nNaturally, it isn't cheap at $4,999 (around \u00a33,925 / AU$7,465) for a single inverter and battery kit, plus $1,599 (around \u00a31,255 / AU$2,390 for the Smart Home Panel 2 (which integrates it with your house). But you can buy both together for $7,199 (\u00a35655 / AU$10,750) in the US and it's hard to think of a more useful home gadget.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Trending News\n53\nEmail\nEmail\nEmail\nLast week, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) denied a second challenge to a patent where the petitioners were co-respondents in an ITC investigation.\u00a0 In\u00a0Shenzhen Silver Star Intelligent Tech. Co., Ltd. v. iRobot, IPR2018-00761 (\u201cthe \u2019761 IPR\u201d), the Board applied the\u00a0General Plastic\u00a0factors and exercised its discretion pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 314(a) and denied institution against iRobot\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 7,155,308 (\u201cthe \u2019308 Patent\u201d).\u00a0 The \u2019308 Patent was also the subject of an unsuccessful challenge in IPR2017-02078 (\u201cthe \u20192078 IPR\u201d), which was filed months earlier. \u00a0The Board found that although petitioners in the \u2019761 IPR and the \u20192078 IPR were not the same or related entities, denial was appropriate because the entities were co-respondents in a related patent infringement Investigation brought by iRobot at the International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d), Inv. No. 337-TA-1057.\u00a0 In a concurrence, one patent judge advanced the notion that in addition to current considerations, the Board should add a factor that asks whether petitioners are co-defendants in a patent litigation where the challenged patent is asserted.\nWhen determining whether to exercise its discretion to deny a petition filed against a previously challenged patent, the Board applies the non-exhaustive\u00a0General Plastic\u00a0factors.\u00a0 In\u00a0General Plastic, a precedential decision, \u201cthe Board articulated a non-exhaustive list of [seven] factors to be considered in evaluating whether to exercise its discretion, under U.S.C. \u00a7 314(a), to deny a petition that challenges a patent that was previously challenged before the Board.\u201d\nIn the \u2019761 IPR, the Board found that because the second petitioner not only had access to iRobot\u2019s Preliminary Response from the \u20192078 IPR Petition, it used iRobot\u2019s arguments therein to form its invalidity arguments (third factor) and waited months after identifying the prior art before filing (fourth factor), the third and fourth factors weighed strongly against institution. In addition, the Board found that the Petitioner was aware of four of the five prior art references asserted in the Petition, as they were also asserted in the \u20192078 IPR Petition and in the related ITC Investigation, and thus was aware of those references for five and half months prior to filing the Petition.\u00a0 Petitioner was further criticized for not adequately explaining the time gap (fifth factor). Thus, the Board found that factors three, four, and five all weighed strongly against institution. The Board noted that factor two, which is somewhat related to factor five, also weight against institution because the Petitioner knew about the art when the first petition was filed.\nThe Board found that factor one weighed in favor of institution because Shenzen Silver, the petitioner in the \u2019761 IPR, had not previously filed a petition directed at the same claims of the \u2019308 Patent.\u00a0 It reasoned that although Shenzhen Silver and Shenzhen Zhiyi are co-respondents in the related ITC investigation and were served with patent infringement complaints in the district court at about the same time, the entities are not related. The Board also determined factors six and seven, which address the finite resources of the Board and consider the requirement to issue a final determination not later than one year after institution of IPR, to be neutral.\u00a0 It rejected iRobot\u2019s arguments that the twelve grounds asserted in the Petition would strain the Board\u2019s resources, and that the Petition would be more difficult for the Board to review in a year than any other petition.\nAfter weighing these factors, the Board determined that denial of institution was appropriate. Of particular note, during its discussion of the third factor, the Board noted that \u201cthe timing of Petitioner\u2019s filing in this case raises the potential for abuse, because Petitioner had ample opportunity (almost three months) to study the arguments raised by Patent Owner regarding the commonly challenged claims of the \u2019308 Patent.\u201d\u00a0 This is consistent with how the Board has approached other instances where a follow-on petition was filed after receiving a patent owner response in a previously-filed IPR by the same party.\nThe concurrence suggested that the Board should consider an eighth factor in situations such as here, where the petitioners in the serial IPR petitions are co-defendants in litigation. Analysis of this factor could also include a rebuttable presumption that an after-filed petition should be denied under\u00a0General Plasticwhere the after-filed petition was filed after an earlier filed petition has received a preliminary response or institution decision.\u00a0 This, the concurrence reasoned, \u201cwould provide useful guidance and emphasis on how strongly timing issues may dictate the outcome when there are similarly situated defendants.\u201d\nAs the law continues to develop regarding the Board\u2019s application of its discretion to institute IPR in similar factual circumstances, parties considering filing IPR petitions should consider the timing and possible collaboration of IPR petitions where similarly situated defendants are involved, and patent owners should carefully review who has filed petitions and when to determine if the\u00a0General Plastic\u00a0factors apply.\nCurrent Legal Analysis\nMore from Mintz\nUpcoming Legal Education Events\nSign Up for e-NewsBulletins\nFooter Menu 1\nFooter Menu 2\nFooter Menu 3\nLegal Disclaimer\nYou are responsible for reading, understanding and agreeing to the National Law Review's (NLR\u2019s) and the National Law Forum LLC's \u00a0Terms of Use and Privacy Policy before using the National Law Review website.

The PTAB relied on the General Plastic factors\u2014a non-exhaustive list of seven factors\u2014to exercise its discretion under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 314(a) to deny the follow-on petition. General Plastic Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Canon Kabushiki Kaisha, IPR2016-01357, Paper 19, \u00a7 II.B.4.i (PTAB Sept. 6, 2017) (precedential).\nLitigation began in April 2017 when patent owner iRobot Corp. filed complaints in the ITC and district court, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,155,308 (\u201cthe \u2019308 patent\u201d), against Shenzhen Silver Star and others, including Shenzhen Zhiyi Technology Co., Ltd. Shenzhen Zhiyi brought the first challenge to the \u2019308 patent in an IPR petition filed September 8, 2017. After the patent owner filed a Preliminary Response to that petition in December 2017, the PTAB denied institution on March 12, 2018. Shenzhen Silver Star filed the second IPR petition challenging the \u2019308 patent, the petition at issue here, on March 8, 2018.\nThe PTAB held that, on balance, the General Plastic factors supported a decision denying the second petition\u2014four factors weighed against institution, two factors were neutral, and one factor weighed in favor of institution. Shenzhen Silver Star, Paper 15 at 14. The factors weighing most strongly against institution were the third factor (\u201cwhether at the time of filing of the second petition the petitioner already received the patent owner\u2019s preliminary response to the first petition or received the Board\u2019s decision on whether to institute review in the first petition\u201d) and the fourth factor (\u201cthe length of time that elapsed between the time the petitioner learned of the prior art asserted in the second petition and the filing of the second petition\u201d). Only the first factor (\u201cwhether the same petitioner previously filed a petition directed to the same claims of the same patent\u201d) favored institution.\nIn a concurring opinion, Administrative Patent Judge William V. Saindon reasoned that similarly situated defendants should ordinarily file their petitions around the same time:\nGiven petitions filed by two or more similarly situated defendants, there is a rebuttable presumption that a later-filed petition will be denied under General Plastic if that later-filed petition is filed after an earlier-filed petition has received a preliminary response or a decision on institution.\nThe concept behind this is that, all things being equal, if two or more co-defendants are sued around the same time, they should, within reason, file their petitions around the same time; it is generally unfair for one defendant to wait for a \u201ctest case\u201d to go through the inter partes review process by another defendant before filing their own petition.\nId. at 16\u201317.\nTo specifically address timing issues in cases with similarly situated defendants, Judge Saindon proposed an additional factor for consideration in the \u00a7 314(a) analysis:\n8. the extent to which the petitioner and any prior petitioner(s) were similarly situated defendants or otherwise realized a similar-in-time hazard regarding the challenged patent.\nId. at 18.\nJudge Saindon cautioned that there might be legitimate reasons not to deny petitions filed after a preliminary response or institution decision. Id. In such cases, \u201cpetitioners are encouraged to explain timing differences relative to the filing of previous petitions by similarly situated defendants.\u201d Id. at 18\u201319.\nThis case is a reminder that the one-year time bar of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(b) serves as a \u201chard ceiling,\u201d which the PTAB understands it is \u201cfree to lower as fairness dictates.\u201d Id. at 18 n.2. In addition to satisfying the one-year time bar, petitioners should consider filing IPR petitions \u201caround the same time\u201d as other similarly situated defendants.\nadd to folder:\nFiled under\nTopics\nPopular articles from this firm\nIf you would like to learn how Lexology can drive your content marketing strategy forward, please email [email\u00a0protected].\nMore from PTAB Litigation Blog\nRelated practical resources PRO\nRelated research hubs\n\u00a9 Copyright 2006 - 2024 Law Business Research"

The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts. The site is features Digital Realty data center campuses to the west and north.\nDuPont Fabros Technology co-founder and CEO Hossein Fateh stepped down from the company in February 2015, and in 2016 founded CloudHQ. The company says it has built and leased 2.4 million square feet and 320MW of data center capacity since its formation. In 2020 Fateh formed Cloud Capital to acquire, manage, develop, and operate data centers.\nCloudHQ has existing and planned data center developments in Ashburn and Manassas, Virginia; London, UK; Milan, Italy; Frankfurt, Germany; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The company is in the process of developing large-scale campuses in Mount Prospect, Illinois, and outside Paris, France.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletters\nMore in North America\nDCD>Connect | New York 2024 Delegate List\nAccelevation Holdings forms data center-focused business unit\nDiscussion\nVIP Private Dinner - by invitation only\nMore in Construction & Site Selection\nData Center Construction Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nCyrusOne seeks planning permission for Dublin data center\nEpisode\nPanel: What really needs to be adapted to accommodate AI at scale & pace\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.
