In contrast, the newly announced Snapdragon XR2+ Gen2 platform promises to accelerate a new wave of MR experiences by upgrading to a dual 4.3K per eye resolution at 90 frames per second with 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp and immersive experiences.\nThe latest reference design pushes the envelope to dual 4K display resolution on the XR2+ Gen2 Platform by making use of a new generation of 3P Pancake lens customed design by Goeroptics with an industry-leading microOLED display. This improves visual acuity with a 95\u00b0 display FOV and a PPD of 44 with improved contrast and reduced ghosting. To better accommodate the popular use-cases in enterprise such as collaborative workplaces and in consumer such as gaming and social networking, binocular, polychromatic video-see-through (VST) is also enabled with a resolution of up to 6MP. An optimized four camera six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) architecture promises a higher accuracy tracking solution. Goertek's reference design can also natively support hand-tracking solution Gemini, offered by Ultraleap.\nThese reference designs based on the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Platform and Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 Platform are a continuation of the Snapdragon-based VR & MR reference designs that Goertek has been building with Qualcomm Technologies since 2015. Over the years, based on Qualcomm's powerful XR computing platform, Goertek has been committed to the hardware development and mass production of VR&MR products to help brand manufacturers quickly bring excellent VR&MR products to market.\n\"Qualcomm Technologies has collaborated with Goertek on XR reference designs for many years,\" said Said Bakadir, Senior Director, Product Management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \"With our new Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 and Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processors, we are excited to deliver premium VR and MR devices powered by Snapdragon platforms to help accelerate time to market for OEMs.\"\nMarvin Chang, Corporate Vice President, Global Head of Marketing, Goertek, Inc. said:\"\u00a0Based on the powerful computing power of Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platforms, combined with Goertek's one-stop solution capabilities in XR products, especially its rich experience in R&D and mass production of XR optical components, this reference design will help MR/VR products achieve more realistic virtual content and better integrate with the real world, allowing users to experience a more natural and realistic immersive experience.\"\nAbout Goertek\nGoertek Inc. is a global leading high-tech company which was established in June 2001, and listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2008, with focus on the R&D, manufacturing and marketing of high-precision components (Acoustics, Optics, Microelectronic, and Enclosure parts) and smart hardware (VR/AR, Wearable, Hearable, Home and others)\nSnapdragon is a trademark or registered trademark of Qualcomm Incorporated.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' Valentine's Day Line -- Here's When It Launches Online\nA New 'Barbie' Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie's Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nWhere to Stream the 2024 Oscar-Nominated Films Online\nTory Burch x Humberto Leon\u2019s New L.A.
