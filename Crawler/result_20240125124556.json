Daqin New ENERGY Tech (Taizhou) focuses on the development of overseas household energy storage product R&D and production. It is one of the first excellent enterprises in China to deploy overseas energy storage markets. The two parties have joined forces to give full play to their respective advantages, and through complementary resources, they will jointly rapidly expand the market share of overseas household energy storage products.\nIn terms of performance, Pret expects a net profit attributable to the parent of 200 million to 250 million yuan in 2022, a year-on-year increase of 742% to 953%. According to the company, the main reason for the large increase in net profit in 2022 is that the sales revenue of the main automotive-modified materials has achieved a relatively large increase, and the sales volume of products has continued to grow.\nIn addition, Pret completed the major asset reorganisation of Highstar in August 2022, and Highstar became a holding subsidiary of Pret.\nFor queries, please contact Michael Jiang at michaeljiang@smm.cn\nFor more information on how to access our research reports, please email\nservice.en@smm.cn\nSMM Events & Webinars"
