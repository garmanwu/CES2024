With hAIsten AI, they will demonstrate how to train AI models using multiGPUs without coding and deploy AI with a single click.\nhAIsten\u00a0AI, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that speeds up AI development with just a few clicks, will be unveiled at CES 2022 following unprecedented interest in Avalanche Computing's low-code solutions at CES 2021.\nhAIsten AI aims to improve time-consuming process with a single click\nAI development is typically a time-consuming process that takes more than a year, with the involvement of costly high-quality talent such as data scientists, engineers, domain experts, and managers. The model inference process alone can take another 12 to 24 months before deployment kicks in. After an AI model is completed, developers still need to spend time and hire engineers to deploy their AI models.\nThe so-called traditional way of developing AI also eats up a massive amount of time, as waiting for computing takes up to 80% of that time. Both these time and cost barriers keep small businesses from competing on a level playing field with larger businesses with deeper pockets.\nhAIsten AI is a game changer: the low-code AI software leverages multi-GPUs to speed up AI development and shortens the AI development cycle from years to months.\nhAIsten AI features accelerated model training with multiple GPUs and test multiple algorithms within a short period, one-command AI model deployment, and real-time dashboard monitoring so users can monitor their model training status and manage all models for better AI operations. Everyone will be able to use hAIsten AI to create AI applications with just a few clicks, making AI accessible for all.\nAvalanche Computing (Taiwan) co-founder and CEO Jay Chen said, \"We are really excited to share hAIsten AI with CES 2022 participants and believe this tool will revolutionize how data scientists train their algorithms, creating more parity in the AI development space.\"\nCo-founder Jason Huang concurred, adding, \"Our technology enables teams to bring their new products to the market faster, supporting their competitiveness in the fast-evolving AI arena.\"\nhAIsten AI supports AI model training and deployment on both cloud and edge devices. It is compatible with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure cloud solutions as well as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and OpenVino hardware.\nAbout Avalanche Computing Taiwan Inc.\nAvalanche Computing is a deep tech and hyper-scale computing startup based in Taipei, Taiwan and California, U.S. that focuses on providing low-code tools to speed up AI development and make programming life easier. Led by a team with experience in AI and big data industries, Avalanche Computing's newest SaaS product \u2013 hAIsten AI \u2013\u00a0 supports NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Intel hardware.\nAvalanche Computing has won multiple awards for its AI solutions, including two Best Startup (Taiwan and APAC) by EE Times Awards Asia, Deep Tech Pioneer by Hello Tomorrow, and two AI awards from AI media in the U.K. Avalanche Computing was one of only 10 software pitch teams in the selectUSA summit, Hello Tomorrow Deep Tech Pioneer, and made the top 10 at the Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge 2021.\nFor more information, please visit avalanc.com\u00a0or read our blog\u00a0to stay updated on AI development trends.

With hAIsten AI, they will demonstrate how to train AI models using multiGPUs without coding and deploy AI with a single click.\nhAIsten\u00c2\u00a0AI, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that speeds up AI development with just a few clicks, will be unveiled at CES 2022 following unprecedented interest in Avalanche Computing's low-code solutions at CES 2021.\nhAIsten AI aims to improve time-consuming process with a single click\nAI development is typically a time-consuming process that takes more than a year, with the involvement of costly high-quality talent such as data scientists, engineers, domain experts, and managers. The model inference process alone can take another 12 to 24 months before deployment kicks in. After an AI model is completed, developers still need to spend time and hire engineers to deploy their AI models.\nThe so-called traditional way of developing AI alsoeats up a massive amount of time, as waiting for computing takes up to 80% of that time. Both these time and cost barriers keep small businesses from competing on a level playing field with larger businesses with deeper pockets.\nhAIsten AI is a game changer: the low-code AI software leverages multi-GPUs to speed up AI development and shortens the AI development cycle from years to months.\nhAIsten AI features accelerated model training with multiple GPUs and test multiple algorithms within a short period, one-command AI model deployment, and real-time dashboard monitoring so users can monitor their model training status and manage all models for better AI operations. Everyone will be able to use hAIsten AI to create AI applications with just a few clicks, making AI accessible for all.\nAvalanche Computing (Taiwan) co-founder and CEO Jay Chen said, \"We are really excited to share hAIsten AI with CES 2022 participants and believe this tool will revolutionize how data scientists train their algorithms, creating more parity in the AI development space.\"\nCo-founder Jason Huang concurred, adding, \"Our technology enables teams to bring their new products to the market faster, supporting their competitiveness in the fast-evolving AI arena.\"\nhAIsten AI supports AI model training and deployment on both cloud and edge devices. It is compatible with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure cloud solutions as well as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and OpenVino hardware.\nAbout Avalanche Computing Taiwan Inc.\nAvalanche Computing is a deep tech and hyper-scale computing startup based in Taipei, Taiwan and California, U.S. that focuses on providing low-code tools to speed up AI development and make programming life easier. Led by a team with experience in AI and big data industries, Avalanche Computing's newest SaaS product \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hAIsten AI \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0 supports NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Intel hardware.\nAvalanche Computing has won multiple awards for its AI solutions, including two Best Startup (Taiwan and APAC) by EE Times Awards Asia, Deep Tech Pioneer by Hello Tomorrow, and two AI awards from AI media in the U.K. Avalanche Computing was one of only 10 software pitch teams in the selectUSA summit, Hello Tomorrow Deep Tech Pioneer, and made the top 10 at the Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge 2021.\nFor more information, please visit avalanc.com\u00c2\u00a0or read our blog\u00c2\u00a0to stay updated on AI development trends.
