The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI. Govee, a smart lighting maker from Shenzhen, is advertising the use of generative AI to help people create specific moods, like asking for a backdrop that is evocative of the Hong Kong skyline or Barbie Dreamhouse.\nXpeng is among the major electric vehicle makers at the show, where it will be demonstrating its new \u201cflying car\u201d, the AeroHT.\nTikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance have been under intense political scrutiny in Washington over data privacy and national security concerns. This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.\n\u201cWe like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don\u2019t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cInstead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.\u201d"

        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

At CES 2024, we can expect to see everything from TVs to laptops, from smartphones to smart tractors. Basically if it runs off of electricity, it'll be at the show.\nCES 2024 technically starts tomorrow, but there have already been a ton of announcements, and the week is just getting started. We're live on the show floor, though, and we'll continue to update this article each day with the latest CES 2024 announcements.. Not everything will actually come to market, but we will get a pretty good idea what products will look like over the next year or so.\nCES 2024: When Is It Happening?\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST). However, unlike many other trade shows which are all about the main keynote, CES is a more prolonged beast. Tech manufacturers from all over the world will have their own keynotes, or will just have gadgets on the show floor to show off.\nThis is why it's a good idea to stay tuned to IGN, as we'll be keeping our eyes open for the strange new technology that is scattered around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nWhat is CES?\nCES stands for the Consumer Electronics Show, an annual industry-only tradeshow that features all the newest technology coming to market over the next couple of years. The show isn't really meant to show new products per se, but rather the tech and trends that are going to be powering the new products.\nEverything Announced at CES 2024 So Far\nNvidia Launches Super-Powered Graphics Cards\nNvidia has announced three new graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super, replacing the RTX 4080, 4070 Ti and 4070, respectively. This is a classic mid-generation refresh looking to convince more folks to upgrade their PCs. The first of these cards to hit the market will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, which comes out on January 17, but don't worry, all three will be out by the end of the month.\nMSI Is Here to Claw Some of the Handheld Gaming PC Market From Asus and Valve\nThe best handheld gaming PCs are here to stay, and the latest is the MSI Claw. Rather than being powered by the AMD Z1 chip, like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally, the Claw is powered by the new Intel Core Ultra processor, backed by Intel Arc graphics. Onboard graphics are usually a bad word when it comes to PC gaming, but this time around both Intel and MSI seem confident in what this chip can do. I know I'm excited to put it through its paces, and see how it compares to the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally.\nApple Swoops In With a Surprise Vision Pro Announcement\nWhile Apple technically isn't here in Las Vegas for CES, the Cupertino giant did take some of the spotlight when it suddenly announced a release date for the Apple Vision Pro, the company's take on a VR/AR headset. Preorders for the headset go live January 19th, and it will officially hit the market on February 2. That's not much longer to wait for a product that we thought was going to keep getting pushed back. Let's just hope it's worth that $3,499 price tag.\nSony and Honda Drive Cars With a DualSense Controller\nSony and Honda teamed up at CES to show off the Honda Afeela driven with a Sony DualSense controller. That's exciting for sure, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just a tech demo and not something that is guaranteed to come to market. And, honestly, it's probably safe to assume it will, at least any time soon. Doesn't stop it from looking cool as hell, though.\nWhat To Expect From CES 2024\nTL;DR: Here's What to Expect\nIt's hard to even think about CES 2024 without bringing up AI. Not only have AI-based language models like Chat GPT been the center of conversation all year, but both Intel and AMD have announced new processors that'll have silicon dedicated to AI workloads. Couple that with the fact Apple has had a Neural Engine built into its processors since the M1 hit the market in 2020 means that LLMs (language learning models) and AI-based image generation are going to be processed locally on the best laptops, rather than in the cloud.\nDon't worry, gaming is totally going to be affected by this too. Ever since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in 2019, Nvidia's graphics cards have shipped with Tensor Cores which are purpose-built to handle machine learning workloads. This is the hardware behind the hugely-successful DLSS, or Deep-Learning Super Sampling. So, you can expect Nvidia to show up in Vegas to show off what's coming next for their own special AI upscaling secret sauce.\n2023 has also been huge for handheld gaming. The Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have all made waves for basically being a Nintendo Switch that can run all your favorite Steam games on the go. However, all of these systems are basically using the same AMD Z1 chipset. It'd be nice to see AMD come out with a new chipset that can show off the next generation of handheld gaming. Or, even better, if Nvidia or Intel came out with something similar that can introduce some competition to that space.\nBeyond gaming, we're likely to hear something from smartwatch manufacturers, especially after Apple announced it would stop selling its flagship smartwatches, according to a report from 9to5Mac. This comes via a lawsuit around Apple using imported blood oxygen level-monitoring technology. So, either we're going to see a new company take on this challenge or we're going to at least hear some kind of discussion about how best to move forward.\nCES 2024 is going to be full of surprises too. Every year the LVCC show floor is packed with inventive little gadgets that really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as we'll keep it updated with the coolest tech CES 2024 has to offer.\nIGNRecommends"

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Sony first exhibited at CES in 1977, forty-six years ago, and since then, CES has remained an important venue for Sony to introduce its latest technologies and initiatives, as well as convey various messages to the world. At CES 2024, Sony will showcase various technologies and initiatives that support creators, based on Sony's purpose to \"fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\"\n\"CES 2024\" Sony Press Conference (online distribution)\nDate and time: January 8, 2024, 5:00 p.m. PST\nHow to watch: Sony Square\nWe're sure you're curious about what will be announced at CES 2024, so for more information, please watch the live stream of the press conference on January 8th(PST). In this blog, we would like to look back on the history of Sony at CES.\nWhat is CES?\nCES, currently held in Las Vegas every January, originally started as a consumer electronics trade show under the name \"Consumer Electronics Show.\" It is one of the world's largest technology trade shows and was first held in New York in 1967. It has since continued for more than 50 years, while undergoing various event frequency changes and taking place in a number of different host cities, including Chicago.\nSony and CES\nSony exhibited at CES for the first time in June 1977, at the Summer CES held in Chicago. The company newsletter at the time stated, \"The CE Show is an event held twice each year, in winter and summer, and is equivalent to Japan's audio fairs and electronics shows, where we give `big demonstrations' of audio products at the venue.\" At the time, CES was more of a consumer electronics trade show, and for Sony it had a strong meaning as a place to unveil new products. For example, at the 1982 Summer CES, the Sony booth set up a \"Future Corner\" featuring a spaceship and exhibited the world's first CD player, which was about to be released at the time, as well as the innovative Mavica Prototype, which could record still images on floppy disks and was a precursor to the electric still camera.\nProposing renaming CES as the \"Creative Entertainment Show\" in 1990\nIn 1990, Akio Morita, then chairman of Sony, was the first Japanese person to provide the keynote speech at CES, an event where executives from leading companies give presentations. In his speech, Morita touched on the products that Sony had developed to date, emphasizing that the consumer electronics industry had entered an era in which new forms of entertainment were being created. He also cited the spread of movie video software and music CDs as an example, saying, \"I leave it up to you whether you believe CES still means \"Consumer Electronics Show\". But by looking back at the past, and peeking over the horizon at the future, I believe the letters CES could be better read as, \"Creative Entertainment Show.\" It is clear that the words \"creative\" and \"entertainment\" have been extremely important to Sony ever since then.\nIn 2019, about 30 years after Morita took the stage, current chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said, \"Sony is a Creative Entertainment Company\". He also stated, \"Working with creators, Sony's professional grade technologies support creators across the entertainment industries to produce compelling content\", which would form the foundation for Sony's current Identity.\nRecently, CES has been increasing its presence as a place where the world's latest technologies can be experienced, not only those from electronics manufacturers but also the automotive, semiconductor and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as various startups. Sony has also gradually changed the approach of its exhibitions, contributing to the possibilities of entertainment and making CES one of the most important venues for introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators. What kind of \"future cutting-edge technology\" do you think will be introduced this year?\nSony's press conference at \"CES 2024\" will be available to watch on Sony Group Official YouTube from January 8, 5:00 p.m. (PST), (archived viewing available). In addition, \"Sony Square\" will gradually release video content related to on-site exhibitions. Please look forward to it!\nIntroducing the Upcoming \"Sony Creators Conference\": Technology Conference for the Creative Community\nSony will hold the first-ever \"Sony Creators Conference \" in Los Angeles on Tuesday, August 8 and Wednesday, August 9 (local time). The event will feature talks and panel discussions by creators from across the Sony Group, including games, technology and film, as well as a keynote speech from Senior Executive Vice President and CTO Hiroaki Kitano. In this blog, we will introduce the main objectives of the event and the lineup of talk sessions that will also be made available online. We invite you to tune into the event for a glimpse into a future at the intersection of creativity and technology.\nWhat are the growth narratives across Sony\u2019s diverse businesses?The \u201cBusiness Segment Meeting 2023\u201d provides a platform for each business unit to share its story\nOn May 24th and 25th, Sony Group Corporation held its \"Business Segment Meeting 2023\u201c, where management from the Game & Network Services, Music, Pictures, Entertainment, Technology & Services, and Imaging & Sensing Solutions segments explained the growth stories of their business.\nContributing to Creativity through Management with a Long-term View, and Achieving Growth through Evolution of Diversity - Sony Corporate Strategy Meeting 2023 -\nSony held the \"Corporate Strategy Meeting 2023\" at its headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo on May 18. Kenichiro Yoshida, Chairman and CEO, spoke on the theme of \"Contributing to Creativity through Management with a Long-term View, and Achieving Growth through Evolution of Diversity.\" In his presentation he provided an overview of Sony's businesses, which originated in sound and have expanded through management from a long-term perspective, and introduced a number of initiatives related to the pursuit of Kando centered on Sony's Purpose. President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki also took the stage and underlined how Sony aims to achieve further growth by continuing to evolve the diversity of its people and businesses, and explained the growth strategies for each business.
