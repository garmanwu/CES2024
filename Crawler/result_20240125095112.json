        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nKeep your lights on for a whole month with this new EcoFlow portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra can power your home appliances for up to a month.\nForget power banks or small power stations: Today at CES 2024, EcoFlow, one of the leaders in portable power and eco-friendly energy solutions, unveiled not just a power station, but a residential power backup system designed for long power outages and daily use -- the EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nThe Delta Pro Ultra been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree for its exceptional design and groundbreaking technology, the company said. A single EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra unit has a power capacity of 6kWh, and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input -- enough power to run an entire home. (ZDNET's Maria Diaz got to test the Delta Pro Ultra in her home, and was impressed.)\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nUsing separate stackable units allows for rapid expansion of storage and output. And to make sure that you don't run out of power, the system is compatible with a variety of energy sources, including solar and gas.\nThat not enough power?\nThe Delta Pro Ultra can be tied into your existing solar panel setup, and allows power inputs up to 16.8kW. With the addition of expansion packs, the power capacity can be expanded to a whopping 90kWh, which is enough to power essential appliances in a home for up to a month.\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra can even charge your EV.\n\"In the face of increasing energy insecurity due to grid failures and extreme weather, we have developed Delta Pro Ultra along with Smart Home Panel 2 to address these challenges,\" Brian Essenmacher, EcoFlow's head of North American business development, said in a press release. \"We aim to empower individuals with the freedom to choose the best power solutions in daily use for their households and give them peace of mind during power outages.\"\nAlso:\u00a0The best portable power stations you can buy\nOne of the concerns that consumers have with such systems is longevity, especially given the price (we'll come to that in a moment), and to counter this EcoFlow has used EV-grade lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries that are designed to offer over 10 years of daily use, spanning some 3,500 discharge cycles before reaching 80% of original capacity.\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra inverter and battery kit will be available for for $4,999, and the Smart Home Panel 2 (which integrates the Delta Pro Ultra with your home) available for purchase at $1,599, or as a bundled package with Delta Pro Ultra for $6,399 until Feb. 9. After that, the prices will rise to $5,799 for Delta Pro Ultra, $1,899 for Smart Home Panel 2 and $7,499 for the Delta Pro Ultra bundle.\nRelated\nWinter is here: This backup power station could come in handy - and it's $200 off\nThe best home battery and backup systems of 2024\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra is the home backup system we needed during a recent storm"

Comprising an impressively large, smart whole-house battery generator and backup system, EcoFlow\u2019s DELTA Pro Ultra has already been recognized with a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honor for its design and technology.\nThe DELTA Pro Ultra is designed to be a residential power back-up system that, according to EcoFlow, can handle both extended outages and daily use. The battery can hold a total capacity of anywhere from 6kWh to 90kWh with 7.2kW output, allowing it to power household essentials such as lights and refrigerators for up to a month at max capacity.\nThe system itself is modular, with a single battery having a max capacity of 6kWh and being stackable in groups of five under a single inverter with a grand total of three inverters capable of being connected to the company\u2019s newly launched Smart Home Panel 2, adding up to the 90kWh total potential capacity.\nEcoFlow does note, however, that for simpler installations, installers can forgo the Smart Home Panel 2 and use either a transfer switch or inlet box to connect the battery to the home grid. Either way, an electrician will be required when hooking the DELTA Pro Ultra up to the grid.\nFor those that do use the Smart Home Panel 2, apart from the added battery capacity, users can see a significant upscaling of the output of the system to 21.6kW, which EcoFlow touts can handle even the most demanding of households. It also helps ramp up the energy efficiency of the system, decreasing total energy needed overall.\nThe Future of Digital Lighting & Control\nUsers can even use the EcoFlow app to individually control appliances on the Smart Home Panel 2, which provides 12 loads of circuit-level control in addition to providing automatic switchover, energy monitoring and EV charging scheduling.\nRelated: Energy Management at \u2018Big Boom Window\u2019 for Integrators\nAnd the battery itself is quite versatile when it comes to energy input, being able to be charged through AC power, solar panels and gas generators. For solar, the DELTA Pro Ultra can integrate with both existing rooftop solar systems and flexible solar panels, featuring solar input from 5.6kW up to 16.8kW.\nBecause of this, EcoFlow is quick to point out that while the battery shines in emergency situations, it\u2019s also capable of helping offset energy expenses while also excelling in off-grid applications due to its modular and scalable nature.\nIn emergency situations, however, EcoFlow boasts a 0ms switchover for devices directly connected to the DELTA Pro Ultra Inverter, while the Smart Home Panel 2 reportedly guarantees a fully automated whole-home switchover in under 20ms. The system also comes with a storm detection feature as well that allows it to prep storage in anticipation of an oncoming storm.\nEcoFlow also promises effective use up to 10 years on the DELTA Pro Ultra, assuming daily use of the device, with effective use being defined as the battery reaching 80 percent of its original capacity, so even beyond that timeframe, the DELTA Pro Ultra is still kicking for those who don\u2019t mind the slightly reduced capacity.\nAccording to EcoFlow, the DELTA Pro Ultra is meant to provide a solution to both the growing instability of US power grids as well as the surge in extreme weather events that have been occurring across the country, focusing less on the energy management aspect of the home, as previous battery and smart panel solutions have, and focusing more on energy security.\nThe DELTA Pro Ultra will be available starting Jan. 9 on the EcoFlow website and Amazon.com. Users can purchase DELTA Pro Ultra (inverter and battery) for $4999, placing the offering the more affordable end of the spectrum as far as home energy management options are concerned. The Smart Home Panel 2 is available for purchase at $1599, or as a bundled package with DELTA Pro Ultra for $6399 until February 9. After that date, prices will be set $5799 for DELTA Pro Ultra, $1899 for Smart Home Panel 2 and $7499 for the DELTA Pro Ultra bundle.\nIf you enjoyed this article and want to receive more valuable industry content like this, click here to sign up for our digital newsletters!\nARTICLE TOPICS\nARTICLE TAGS\nSHARE\nSHOW NEWSLETTER\nCE Pro\nContent Types\nNewsProductsProjectsCompaniesDownloadsWebcastsPodcastsEvents\nSpecials\nCompany Info\nAboutContact UsCustomer ServiceAdvertise with Us\nSubscribe\nConnect\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInYouTubeRSS Feed\nCategories"
