The market is segmented into compressor type, absorption type and thermoelectric type car refrigerators, with each type catering to different consumer needs.\n\u00f0\u0178\u201c\u0160As travel and outdoor activities gain more and more attention from people, the growth prospects of the car refrigerator market are promising, providing opportunities for product innovation and market expansion.\nMore in: https://lnkd.in/gQdDijxP\n333 followers\n\"Colku Shines at 2024 Beijing ISPO Exhibition with Innovative Refrigeration Product\"\n\u00f0\u0178\u201c\u0160Beijing, 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As a leader in the refrigeration industry, Colku recently demonstrated its innovative products at the 2024 Beijing ISPO exhibition and achieved remarkable success.

These products attracted the attention of many exhibitors with their excellent performance and innovative technology.\nMore in: https://lnkd.in/g5Gqcwdi\n333 followers\n\"Why long-haul truck drivers are turning to parking air conditioners\"\n\u00f0\u0178\u2020\u2022Compared with the original parking air conditioning system, the biggest advantage of parking air conditioning is its energy consumption pattern. While stock vehicle systems rely on the engine to operate, parking air conditioning is designed to be used when the engine is turned off, typically relying on the vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battery or an independent power system such as solar panels.\n\u00f0\u0178\u2020\u2022This means that even during long periods of parking, the driver can enjoy continuous cooling or heating without placing additional strain on the engine. In terms of installation location, the parking air conditioner is usually installed in the sleeping compartment of the truck, which is different from the front integrated position of the original vehicle air conditioner. The different installation positions make parking air conditioning a flexible supplementary option, providing extra comfort especially for drivers who need to park for long periods of time.\nMore in: https://lnkd.in/gn5cGXCq\n333 followers\n\"ISPO Beijing 2024, Colku Invites You To Explore The Fun Of Outdoor Sports With New Car Refrigerators And Camping Refrigerators!\"\nColku Company made its debut as an exhibitor at the 18th Asian Sporting Goods and Fashion Exhibition in ISPO Beijing 2024.

So, I called this repair service again because it had previously provided outstanding response time and a durable fix when the washer failed and these more traditional services also could not respond within a reasonably short time. I am pleased to report an identical outcome for the dryer as was the case for the washer. The same technician did both services and I was quite pleased with his knowledge and communication clarity.
