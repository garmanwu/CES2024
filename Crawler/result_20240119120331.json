Specifically, Walmart revealed:\nBut adaptive retail is not limited to search and discovery; it\u2019s about creating personalized, seamless and flexible shopping experiences from start to finish.\n\u201cWhile omnichannel retail has been around for decades, this new type of retail \u2013 adaptive retail \u2013 takes it a step further,\u201d said Suresh Kumar, global chief technology officer and chief development officer, Walmart Inc. \u201cIt\u2019s retail that is not only eCommerce or in-store, but a single, unified retail experience that seamlessly blends the best aspects of all channels.

Of the 120,000 items in a Supercenter, 75% meet the size and weight requirements for drone delivery.\nOur associates\nWhile many companies concentrate on developing exceptional technology for their customers, Walmart is also focused on providing the same level of experience to its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Last August, the company launched a GenAI tool for U.S. and Canada campus-based associates called\u00a0My Assistant, which was created in-house by Walmart\u2019s tech team.\nToday, Walmart announced plans to\u00a0expand its proprietary My Assistant tool. In the year ahead, campus associates in 11 countries will be able to interact with My Assistant in their native language. From speeding up the drafting process, to serving as a creative partner, to summarizing large documents, My Assistant is changing how associates work and solve problems.\nSociety\nAs a company that develops tech for good, Walmart has been on a journey to reduce the impact of its operations on the environment since 2005. Currently powering more than 47% of its operations with renewable energy and on track to power more than 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2035, Walmart also announced ambitious clean energy goals at CES.\nBy the end of 2030, the company aims is to advance its transition toward emissions-free energy by enabling up to 10 gigawatts of new clean energy projects into service on- and off-site \u2013 the equivalent of the annual power consumption of more than 2 million households. This will enable tens of thousands of U.S. households to save on their electricity bills.\nAbout WalmartWalmart Inc.

Delivering that will be tricky\nWalmart is joining the AI, drone and tech race. But delivering on the promise of a high-tech shopping future \u2014\u00a0where its rivals have failed \u2014 won\u2019t be easy.\nThe bigbox retailer held a keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas for the first time, featuring CEO Doug McMillon, a plethora of executives, and even Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\nIts overarching pitch through the hour-long presentation was this: Consumers are going to have a much faster, more convenient time shopping at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club.\nCES is the largest consumer tech conference of the year \u2014 but it\u2019s also a major sales convention, where companies put on flashy presentations to attract both investors and customers, often before actively implementing the new technology.\nIn that vein, this year\u2019s conference was, naturally, all about AI.\n\u201cThe underlying principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way around. This path enables people to do things in more efficient and enjoyable ways,\u201d McMillon said.\nWalmart is jumping on the AI trend for now. The company said it\u2019s implementing it in everything from its supply chain to its app, along with developments to drone delivery and shopping at Sam\u2019s Club.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Walmart has not rolled out its plans nationwide yet. Many of its announcements are currently in select markets, though the company said it plans to roll them out this year.\nDrone delivery\nWalmart has already made 20,000 drone deliveries in the past two years, but in 2024 it is going all in on the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. The superstore announced that it is offering drone delivery for up to 75%\u00a0of the Dallas area\u2019s population, or about 1.8 million homes.\nBut drone delivery as a concept isn\u2019t new, and Walmart\u2019s timeline to take off in Dallas is remarkably short.\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos revealed delivery drones on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d nearly a decade ago, but the technology has long faced regulatory, technical and financial problems for tech companies.\nWhile companies from UPS to Volkswagen initially started out bullish on using drones for their business supply chains, hurdles have remained and stymied tech delivery for both smaller startups and huge retailers like Amazon or pharmacy chains.\nThe money at stake is substantial: A Fortune Business Insights\u00a0report has estimated that the commercial drone market will balloon to nearly $47.4 billion by 2029.\nFirst, however, companies must navigate regulations, consumer skepticism and the actual safe return of their technology.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration regulates commercial drone deliveries, and they have high standards to meet.\nFor example, CNBC reported last year that FAA required Amazon\u2019s Prime Air to complete hundreds of hours of flying without incidents and submit data to the agency before a broader rollout, and that was after it allowed clearance for testing.\nWalmart has similarly ambitious plans. Its delivery expansion includes 30 towns and municipalities, which the retailer says will lead the retail industry.\nDrone deliveries take between 10 to 30 minutes, the company said. Around 75% of the 120,000 items in the superstore meet the size and weight requirements for a drone delivery, Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart US, said during the presentation.\nAmazon\u2019s Prime Air said it wants to expand drone delivery to Italy and the UK by the end of 2024, as well as a third US state.\nWalmart is partnering with drone startups\u00a0Wing\u00a0and\u00a0Zipline, according to a press release.\nExit tech that\u2019s new for customers\nOne of the most universal experiences of Sam\u2019s Club shopping \u2014 showing your receipt before leaving the store \u2014 will soon be no more.\nUsing AI and computer vision technology, the new exit tech builds on its established \u201cScan & Go\u201d feature on Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s app. In Scan & Go, customers scan their items on the mobile app as they go through the store and pay on the app, bypassing the checkout line.\nWalmart didn\u2019t specify how AI would be used, but said it would be \u201cworking in the background to continually speed the process.\u201d\nAmazon launched a similar concept in 2016 with its Go stores in 2016, its checkout free system hailed as the future of shopping. But by March 2023, it had closed eight of its 29 cashier-free stores, another sign of the tech giant\u2019s cost-cutting efforts last year.\nTechnology at the exit takes images of carts and verifies payment for all the products in real time. It\u2019s currently running as a pilot in 10 Sam\u2019s Club locations, but the company plans to expand the technology to all of its locations by the end of the year.\nGenerative AI\nThrough a partnership with Microsoft, Walmart said it is revamping its generative AI usage. Generative artificial intelligence\u00a0\u2014 the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools \u2014\u00a0is the latest buzzword in tech, but its practical applications remain untested.\nThe company didn\u2019t announce any new ventures, but said it was using AI to build on its existing app and InHome service.\nWalmart launched the GenAi search experience for Apple customers on Tuesday, who have the latest version of the app.\nNormally, customers who need to shop for a Super Bowl party search for items on the Walmart app individually, the company said. With GenAi search, they can instead search \u201cfootball watch party\u201d and shop every relevant item they need in the search.\nWalmart also announced advancements in its InHome service, which it debuted in 2019 to deliver groceries straight into customer\u2019s refrigerators.\nWalmart employees wear a camera when they enter customer homes, allowing the customer to watch the process live. The customers have to use an existing smart lock, a garage keypad or a smart lock from InHome.\nThe program has had some hiccups.\nWalmart already uses a network of independent contract drivers on its in-house Spark delivery platforms, which Walmart said in June 2023 operates in all 50 states. Business Insider interviewed Spark drivers, who said customers would get confused their deliver for InHome delivery, asking drivers to bring the products inside the house.\nThe new replenishment tool for InHome uses AI to anticipate needs and orders. The company said its \u201calgorithm learns what customers purchase regularly, how much of these items they purchase and the frequency of those purchases.\u201d\nAmazon Key has a rival in-garage delivery, which is exclusive for Prime members, compatible with certain smart garages. The service costs $1.99 per order for a one to two day delivery time.\nWalmart\u2019s InHome currently costs $19.95 a month or $138 a year.\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "raw_content": "More drone deliveries, new AI tech: Here's a guide to what Walmart unveiled at CES 2024\nShopping at Walmart and Sam's Club is about to get easier.\nWalmart on Tuesday unveiled several new and upcoming offerings that aim to improve the customer experience, from generative AI-powered search tools to technology that will do away with the receipt check lines at Sam's Club.\n\u201cWe build technology to serve people and not the other way around,\u201d Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. \u201cWalmart\u2019s purpose is to help people live better and, today, more than ever, advances in technology make it feel like anything is possible.\u201d\nMcMillon took the stage Tuesday afternoon at the CES consumer technology convention in Las Vegas to highlight the company's latest innovations.\nAI-powered receipt check at Sam\u2019s Club\nNew AI-powered technology at Sam\u2019s Club intends to do away with the long receipt-check lines near the exits.\nThe retailer plans to leverage AI and computer vision technology to confirm that members have paid for all of the items in their carts. Sam\u2019s Club has so far launched the technology at 10 locations as part of a pilot program, with plans to expand to its nearly 600 clubs by the end of the year.\n\"At Sam's Club, we care about every second a member spends with us. So eliminating even the few seconds it takes to scan a receipt at the exit door is well worth it,\" said Megan Crozier, the chief merchant at\u00a0Sam's Club, at CES.\nCEO McMillon acknowledged that some of Walmart's innovations will shift employee roles.\n\"No doubt some tasks will go away and some roles will change. And some of them should, like the ones that involve lifting heavy weight or doing repetitive tasks,\" he said. \"As that's happening, we're designing new roles that our associates tell us are more enjoyable and satisfying and also often result in higher pay.\"\nMore Walmart delivery drones in Texas\nAfter more than 20,000 drone deliveries over the last two years, Walmart is expanding the service to 1.8 million additional households in the Dallas Fort-Worth metroplex. The company says this is the first time a U.S. retailer has offered drone delivery to this many households in a single market.\n\u201cDrone delivery is not just a concept of the future, it\u2019s happening now and will soon be a reality for millions of additional Texans,\u201d Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation\u00a0and automation for Walmart U.S., said in a press release. The new hubs are expected to launch in the coming months, with the expansion complete by the end of the year.\nRoughly three-fourths of the items in Walmart's Supercenters meet the size and weight requirements for drone delivery, with items delivered in 30 minutes or less. The Texas deliveries will be completed through partnerships with on-demand drone delivery providers Wing and Zipline.\nWalmart also offers drone deliveries in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Utah and Virginia.\nAI-powered tools\nWalmart announced Tuesday that a new generative AI-powered search experience is now available on iOS, and available to all platforms later this quarter.\nThe new search allows customers to search by specific use cases. If a customer is throwing a Super Bowl party, for instance, they can search \u201cfootball watch party\u201d to find relevant items instead of typing in multiple searches for things like chips, chicken wings and soda.\nWalmart says the search tool will account for \u201ca variety of other factors\u201d like location and search history to yield better results.\nWalmart also shared details on its new InHome Replenishment tool, which uses AI to help fill customers\u2019 carts with necessary items right when they need it.\nThe new offering expands upon the InHome grocery delivery service launched in 2019, which carries orders directly to customers\u2019 doorstep, garage or kitchen fridge. InHome Replenishment will use a personalized algorithm to anticipate customers\u2019 needs and place orders that are delivered directly to their kitchen. Customers will have the option to skip items that are not needed, add additional items to their order and adjust their delivery date.\n\"It's personalized and adjusts based on your changing needs,\" said Whitney Pegden, vice president of new propositions and pre-transactions at Walmart U.S. \"Not only are we going to get you what you need, we're going to get it to you when you need it and even where you need it, right to your refrigerator.\"\nWalmart has not yet announced when this new service will launch.\nVirtual try-ons\nWalmart also shared that it is working on a new augmented reality (AR) experience called Shop with Friends.\nThe social commerce platform is set to let customers create virtual outfits to share with their friends for feedback. The outfits will be displayed on a virtual model with a size and shape similar to the customer.\nWalmart has not yet announced when this feature will be available.\nMore EV chargers\nWalmart in 2023 announced plans to deploy a nationwide network of fast electric vehicle chargers across thousands of stores and clubs by 2030. Now, Walmart says it plans to start rolling out the chargers this year.\n\"Using partner technology, these chargers will be Walmart-owned and -operated so that we can use best-in-class chargers and deliver a Walmart charging experience. One that is convenient, reliable and affordable,\" said Vishal Kapadia, senior vice president of energy transformation at Walmart."

These enhanced search results will span categories, rivaling Google\u2019s SGE (Search Generative Experience), which can recommend products and show various factors to consider, along with reviews, prices, images and more.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nAhead of CES, the company had\u00a0demonstrated an AI shopping assistant that would let customers interact with a chatbot as they shopped, to ask questions and receive personalized product suggestions, as well. At the time, Walmart teased that a generative AI-powered search feature was also in the works. It suggested customers could ask for things like a \u201cunicorn-themed birthday party\u201d and get results like unicorn-themed napkins, balloons, streamers and more. Now the feature is rolling out on mobile devices, iOS first.\nAnother potentially promising use of AI involves the replenishment of frequently ordered items.\nWalmart will initially test this use case with Walmart InHome Replenishment, which will use AI and its existing replenishment expertise combined to create automated online shopping carts for customers with items they regularly order. Because it\u2019s only available through the InHome program, these items are then delivered to a customer\u2019s fridge in their kitchen or garage using the smart lock-powered InHome delivery service, but it will not be a subscription service.\nThe company also noted that customers will be able to remove items from their basket, as needed, and the service will adjust to customer\u2019s changing needs over time.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nHowever, if the feature works well, it\u2019s not hard to imagine how it could be put to use to offer replenishment of other household items as well, similar to Amazon\u2019s Subscribe-and-Save.\nSurprisingly, Amazon has not yet leveraged AI to do the same (i.e. to augment or replace Dash Replenishment). However, the online retailer has been putting AI to work in other ways, including by helping connect customers with the right product by summarizing product reviews, highlighting key attributes or helping them find clothes that fit.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nAnother new Walmart product making a debut at CES is \u201cShop with Friends,\u201d an AR shopping tool that lets customers share virtual outfits they create with their friends and then get feedback on their finds. The tool combines Walmart\u2019s AI-powered virtual try-on tech, launched last year, with social features.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nCEO Doug McMillon referred to the suite of new products as something he called \u201cadaptive retail\u201d \u2014 that is, retail experiences that are personalized and flexible.\n\u201cWhile omnichannel retail has been around for decades, this new type of retail \u2014 adaptive retail \u2014 takes it a step further, said Suresh Kumar, global chief technology officer, and chief development officer, Walmart Inc., in a statement shared ahead of the CES keynote. \u201cIt\u2019s retail that is not only e-commerce or in-store, but a single, unified retail experience that seamlessly blends the best aspects of all channels. And for Walmart, adaptive retail is rooted in a clear focus on people,\u201d he said.\nThe company touched on other ways it\u2019s employing AI, as well.\nWalmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club will introduce an AI and computer vision-powered technology that helps solve the problem of waiting in line for receipt verification when exiting the store. The pilot, currently running in 10 locations, will confirm members have paid for their items without requiring a store associate to check their charts. Instead, computer vision tech will capture images of customers\u2019 carts and AI will speed the process of matching cart items to sales. Walmart expects to bring the tech to its nearly 600 clubs by year-end.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nIn another area, Walmart\u2019s generative AI tool for store associates, My Assistant, will be expanded to 11 countries outside the U.S. in 2024, where it will work in employees\u2019 native languages. Already, the tool has become available in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua and is on track for launches in India and South Africa. My Assistant helps employees with writing, summarizing large documents and offering \u201cthought starters\u201d to spark creativity, Walmart says.\nImage Credits: Walmart\nOn the matter of AI, McMillon stressed that the company wouldn\u2019t prioritize the technology without considering the potential implications. Instead, Walmart\u2019s \u201cunderlying principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way around,\u201d he said.\nStill, McMillon admitted that AI will mean some jobs will be eliminated.\n\u201cNo doubt some tasks will go away and some roles will change. And some of them should, like the ones that involve lifting heavy weights or doing repetitive tasks,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cAs that\u2019s happening, we\u2019re designing new roles that our associates tell us are more enjoyable and satisfying, and also often result in higher pay. So we\u2019re investing to help our associates transition to this shared future,\u201d McMillon added.\nDuring the keynote, McMillon also brought Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella onstage, after announcing that Walmart used large language models from Azure OpenAI alongside its own retail-specific models.\nNadella spoke broadly about the breakthroughs made possible with generative AI, including in areas like coding, productivity apps, like Microsoft\u2019s own, healthcare, education and more, adding that with new technology, \u201cone has to be mindful that you want to be able to amplify the opportunity with it\u2026and then also be very mindful of the unintended consequences of this technology.\u201d\nOutside of AI, Walmart is looking to other new technology for faster deliveries.\nThe company announced it\u2019s expanding its drone delivery service in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro to 1.8 million households, or 75% of the metroplex area. The deliveries, which take place in 30 minutes or less, are powered by Wing and Zipline. Walmart also notes that 75% of the 120,000 items in a Walmart Supercenter meet the size and weight requirements for drone delivery. To date, Walmart has done over 20,000 drone deliveries in its two-year trial.\nWalmart experiments with generative AI tools that can help you plan a party or decorate"

The new functions allow customers to search for products by use cases instead of by brand or product name. For instance, a customer could search \u201cfootball watch party\u201d and receive suggestions for chips, wings, drinks or a TV.\n\u201cWe use large language models, including OpenAI and (Microsoft-owned) Azure, along with our own models that are retail and Walmart-specific,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cIt\u2019s our models and our data that put the finishing touches on this improved experience. Our new search fundamentally changes the way customers engage with us.\u201d\nOther mobile platforms are expected to roll out this quarter, he said.\nDuring the keynote, McMillon brought Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on stage to discuss the implementation of AI. Nadella spoke broadly about its power, noting that Microsoft founder Bill Gates once spoke about the power of \u201cinformation at your fingertips.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we have in 2024 now is expertise at our fingertips and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for all of us,\u201d Nadella said during the keynote.\nAnother AI function introduced during the keynote was Walmart InHome Replenishment. The service uses AI to learn a customer\u2019s purchase patterns and determine the right pace to restock standard items.\nOther technology announcements from Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, included the expansion of its drone delivery service in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro area, where a two-year trial has been conducted. Walmart executives noted that packages could be delivered from stores up to 10 miles away within 30 minutes.\nThe program is targeted at shoppers who need last-minute purchases like cooking ingredients, over-the-counter medications and last-second gifts. Walmart said about three-in-four items in a super center\u2019s inventory meet the size requirements for drone delivery.\nMcMillon and his team also introduced a beta augmented reality program called \u201cShop with Friends\u201d that lets customers share virtual outfits they created with friends to get feedback on their shopping.\nAnd the company is improving its scan-and-go shopping technology for Sam\u2019s Club shoppers. Some exit queues \u2013 where customers normally must get their receipt scanned before leaving the shopping warehouse, often resulting in lines \u2013 will incorporate AI and computer vision technology to confirm purchases as the customer leaves. The program is in use at 10 locations and is expected to roll out to the nearly 600 Sam\u2019s Clubs by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe care about every second a member spends with us,\u201d Megan Crozier, chief of merchandising for Sam\u2019s Club, said during the keynote. \u201cSo eliminating even the few seconds it takes to scan a receipt at the exit door is well worth it.\u201d\nOther technology advances are meant to improve the company\u2019s supply chain, increasing deployment of robotics at warehouses and the expansion of fast electric vehicle chargers at the company\u2019s stores and clubs.\nMcMillon used part of his speech to acknowledge the potential jobs lost to technology.\n\u201cNo doubt some tasks will go away and some roles will change,\u201d he said. \u201c And some of them should, like the ones that involve lifting heavy weights or doing repetitive tasks. As that\u2019s happening, we\u2019re designing new roles that our associates tell us are more enjoyable and satisfying, and also often result in higher pay.\u201d\nThis year marks the return of Walmart to the four-day technology trade show.

And number two, it can orchestrate the movement of very different products that need to be stored in very different ways.\nForecasting customer demand needs to happen very accurately, but far enough out for our suppliers.\nWe built an industry leading forecasting system that is smart. It's automated and it uses a patent pending machine learning model that predicts customer behavior, and it helps us accurately forecast how much of a product is needed and where. It incorporates dozens of different types of data like historical sales data, but also things like weather forecasts popularity and how an item is trending on social media. We also built artificial intelligence into how we orchestrate the optimal movement of our inventory. The main job is to have the product where our customers needed the most.\"\nMemberships\nResearch\nServices\nFollow Us\n\u00a9 Copyright Constellation Research Inc. 2010 - 2024.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nWalmart makes a rare CES appearance to promote AI-powered shopping\nThe new generative AI-powered search functions are available on iOS and Android mobile devices and on the company\u2019s website.\nWhen Walmart announced it would be holding a CES keynote for the first time, we were admittedly a little skeptical. Now it all makes sense, though: America\u2019s largest retailer came to CES 2024 in Las Vegas to talk about AI. In a joint announcement on Tuesday, the company said that it\u2019s teaming up with Microsoft to build what it bills as AI-powered shopping experiences. In his keynote, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon described how the integration of AI across its website and apps will be used to study shopper behavior and suggest future purchases.\nAs you might expect, given Microsoft\u2019s involvement, the artificial intelligence underpinning these experiences will be powered by large language models made available through this partnership with Microsoft. The AI it plans on deploying will use a combination of retail-specific search functions based on Walmart\u2019s own proprietary technologies and Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI service.\nWalmart\u2019s new generative AI-powered search functions will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices as well as through the company\u2019s website. The new search features will give shoppers more options for interacting with the retailer\u2019s digital inventory. For example, instead of searching for items like soda and chips, a shopper can look for product recommendations for specific events like a birthday celebration or game day watch party by telling the website, in natural language, what they need help shopping for.\nDuring the keynote, McMilon said that the algorithms are designed to highlight relevant product categories after a search that will \u201cserve up a curated list of the best items.\u201d These new algorithmic shopping initiatives will directly compete with Google\u2019s AI search tool SGE and Amazon\u2019s large language model-powered product listing program.\nWhile it seems that most of the efforts on the AI front are consumer-facing, the company said new AI search functions will not just help shoppers. It will also expand tools available to store associates intended to help streamline job-related tasks and workflows. This can also be seen in its announcement that at Sam's Club, which is owned by Walmart, employees will soon no longer need to check shopping receipts as people leave stores. Instead, it will deploy an AI tool that verifies customer purchases.\nAdditionally, Walmart teased \u2018Walmart InHome Replenishment,\u2019 which also will use artificial intelligence to predict what items in a shopper\u2019s cart need to be replenished in a timely manner. This offering will be added as an extension to its \u2018InHome\u2019 program that became available to Walmart+ shoppers in 2019.\nAside from AI, the retailer also teased plans to weave augmented reality into its shopping experience. The company teased \u2018Shop with Friends,\u2019 a beta social commerce offering that uses augmented reality to allow shoppers the option to share virtual outfits with friends for feedback while shopping. Lastly, Walmart will expand its drone delivery testing program to more shoppers in Texas as a starting point. 1.8 million additional households will get access to drone delivery services that help shoppers get items as fast as 30 minutes.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

The show attracts throngs of people \u2013 more than 100,000 attendees and 3,200 exhibitors this year \u2013 from all over the world looking to get a glimpse at what the future holds.\nArmed with a very good pair of walking shoes, I braved the mobbed halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center to specifically get a peek at the tech innovations likely coming to the grocery industry. I saw plenty of metaverse vendors (\u201cimmersive metaverse experience\u201d!), connected fleet technologies, haptic solution providers, hologram customer service kiosks, autonomous grocery delivery vehicles (electric, of course), AI supply chain solutions, virtual reality and augmented reality tech, and incredible advancements in wearable shopping and health devices.\n[Read more: \"The Grocer\u2019s Guide to Tech\"]\nBut it was Walmart\u2019s panel session on Jan. 4 that truly laid out a vision for the future of the grocery retail industry.\nWalmart Chief Revenue Officer Seth Dallaire moderated the session, which also included Walmart Chief Economist John List; Cheryl Ainoa, SVP of New Business and Emerging Technology; Julie Barber, EVP of General Merchandise; and Jill Toscano, VP of Media.\nWalmart presented a three-pronged, omni approach to how it views the path forward for food retail. The approach is called Customer Centricity and is focused on retail media, augmented reality and social commerce. Walmart says it plans to leverage these three technologies, with the help of its partners, to \u201csuper-serve\u201d the evolving American shopper and be their first choice for everything, whether it\u2019s private brand toilet paper, fresh rotisserie chicken or a new pair of jeans.\nBarber, an 18-year Walmart veteran, elaborated on the first prong of Walmart\u2019s approach: retail media and data analytics. Her team meets with the teams at Walmart Connect (the retailer\u2019s ad business) and Luminate (the retailer\u2019s data platform for suppliers), and that \u201chelps us make decisions about what the customer might want to buy or what they have been buying and how we should think about that. Then we can build a plan with the supplier, \u2018Okay, these are the products we need.\u2019 And once we get those products we then say, \u2018How are we going to make sure that they show up in store and online?\u2019\u201d\nData Refinery\nList, who joined Walmart just nine months ago as the company\u2019s first chief economist, said his directive is to think about where the company can use economics and data to make the customer experience better, to make Walmart better.\n\u201cYou often times read that data is the new oil, that data will be the most valuable resource on earth. It's fundamentally not true. It's the data refinery, just like it's the oil refinery, that gives oil the value,\u201d List said. \u201cWe all have data, we all have a ton of data. The difficult part is to try to refine the data and then say something that's reasonable that makes a customer experience work and improve. \u2026 We need to be good little refiners to actually drive business decisions.\u201d\nBarber says one particular area of category interest for Walmart is in the health and wellness space.\n\u201cWalmart spent a lot of time during COVID thinking about what's the technology that we need to have in our stores for our associates and for our customers. So I think there's a lot of areas, there's a lot of ground to cover,\u201d she commented.\nBarber said Walmart has evolved into more than just a \u201cstores business\u201d and has gone full omni.\n\u201cWe've moved from many people, suppliers thinking Walmart's a stores business and I think we started proving over the last few years we're much more than a stores business. We're have a very strong omni-business and it's growing,\u201d Barber said. \u201cWe're seeing suppliers now come to us and say, \u2018Hey, we heard you did this with one of your private brand products and it\u2019s sold out.' Or what you did with online events and bestselling products. And people are really starting to see that. We have a lot of traffic on our site and we have a lot of traffic in our stores.\u201d\nAccelerating AR\nAinoa explained Walmart\u2019s accelerating adoption of augmented reality. \u201cOur mission with emerging tech is simple: How do we initiate the inspiration and the discovery of a need and then how do we shorten the distance, time and friction from the point of inspiration or need identification to actually fulfill that need? Whether that inspiration is in a Walmart store or in a Walmart app or is on a social channel or while watching your favorite show on Roku. However a consumer gets inspired or creates a need, we want to reduce the time and distance that it takes to fulfill that need.\u201d\nShe said that the retailer plans to use more AR and AI not just in paths to purchase but also to power associate tools.\nAinoa then talked about how Walmart is now doing a lot of things online first, a departure from previous strategy.\n\u201cWe do see trends of things that go online first. Maybe it even starts on a third-party marketplace,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing is we know so much data about the customer that we're able to say, \u2018We think based on the customer that's buying these probiotics, this subset of stores, it's really important to go in.\u2019 Each week our team is getting those Pinterest search terms and trends and all those things and they're saying, \u2018Oh wow, people are starting to look for this. Let's work with our third-party team and make sure we can get it soon. Do we think this is a long term trend? Maybe we should buy this for Halloween' or whatever it may be. We know that we have influencers out there that will say ... make a TikTok on something and the product will sell out immediately.\u201d\nAinoa also reiterated the value of Walmart\u2019s Roku partnership.\n\u201cWith TV advertising, you can\u2019t really actually ever measure truly what your results are. With our T-commerce partnership with Roku, we have direct information,\u201d Ainoa said. \u201cWe know exactly how many times it was shown, we can map it back to the actual purchases, who cares about purchasing through that channel, who also then did certain things online, who also made a booking through other ways. So we can give a real look at the customer and give them an experience that matches how they want to find things, who they want to give confidence and who they want to connect with to give them confidence in buying and give it to them how they want to get them.\u201d\nSocial Commerce\nToscano meanwhile weighed in on Walmart\u2019s exploding social commerce business.\n\u201cThe world has changed pretty significantly and one of the ways it has changed is that 302 million Americans are spending over two hours a day on social platforms,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cThat is a tremendous amount of attention that they're giving these networks.\u201d Toscano said the retailer\u2019s social commerce strategy includes re-evaluating where product discovery is now happening.\n\u201cProduct discovery doesn't happen in just the aisles and in search anymore,\u201d she continued. Toscano listed some of the things Walmart is doing in this space, including a partnership with Roku that is generating \u201csome really surprising results that we're looking to scale.\u201d\nToscano indicated Walmart is also focused on livestreams and monetizing content creation with its new Creator platform. All of these initiatives are designed to really measure the measure the impact of where marketing and media investments are placed.\n\u201cROAS is not the single source of truth anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an important metric, but it is not the metric. And so we think about high-value actions in addition to ROAS. We think about customer lifetime value, we think about contribution profit. We think about how our investments at the top of the funnel impacts the performance. Another important partner of ours was able to tell us that a very effective video ad unit of the holiday was able to increase our search by very significant percentage. Knowing that helps us make that investment decision because it's not that video that's expected to drive X amount of traffic or represent the most efficient ROAS, but we know that it has a very complimentary and positive impact. So the conversion aspect of our marketing investment and how that works together is the justification for that investment.\u201d\nWalmart\u2019s aggressive push into retail media, augmented reality and social commerce is a harbinger for what this year is bound to bring in the grocery industry, a year in which everyone will be looking to drive omnichannel profitability.\nEach week, approximately 230 million customers and members visit Walmart\u2019s more than 10,500 stores and numerous e-commerce websites under 46 banners in 24 countries. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company employs approximately 2.3 million associates worldwide.\u00a0Walmart U.S.\u00a0is No. 1 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer\u2019s 2022 list of the\u00a0top food and consumables retailers in North America.\nAlso Worth Reading\nWalmart to Phase Out Single-Use Bags in New York State\nWalmart Deploys Same-Day Drone Delivery in 3 States\nRelated Topics\nStay Fresh.

The Walmart team wanted to give CES attendees a peek into what the company has done and is doing in the technology field, seeing CES as an opportunity to highlight that, beyond convenience and low prices, Walmart is a tech-forward company.\nAfter months of content building, planning and execution, a two-story 50\u2019 x 140\u2019 museum-like walkthrough activation emerged, which Leo Events ensured would be a memorable experience for all who took the journey. Although the original idea was brought to Leo in June, the team didn\u2019t begin to work on the project until August, so with the event just five months out, there was little time to get things done before Jan. 9, the first day of CES.\n\u201cIt takes three things to make an successful event,\u201d says David Kenyon, senior vice president for Leo Events. \u201cYou can have high-quality investments, you can have and inexpensive investment or you can create an event in a truncated timeline but you only get two of those three. If it\u2019s high quality that has a short timeline it\u2019s going to incur more costs. If it\u2019s inexpensive and a short timeline the quality will suffer. They didn\u2019t have time on their side, and they weren\u2019t about sacrifice quality of experience\u201d\nThe Walmart Experience\nAs soon as visitors stepped into the doors of the activation, they were met with three screens that showed several U.S. patents owned by Walmart, related to shipping and deployment of inventory.\nTo the right of this exhibit is where the journey began.\nVisitors could see and interact with a screen that displayed a timeline running from the 1960s to 2021, noting landmark moments from the creation of discount stores in the 1960s to the formation of the Walmart Satellite Network in 1988, which remains the largest private satellite communication system in the United States to the current day. In addition to the walkthrough experience, the activation also housed five meeting spaces\u2014three on the second floor and two on the first\u2014where those interested in learning more could meet with Walmart executives.\nAfter the timeline, visitors could play a pallet building game to race against the AI that packs the pallets at Walmart distribution centers and see who could stack them the fastest. Kenyon said, on average, players stacked between 12% and 16% of what the AI could. Visitors then attended a demonstration of how Walmart uses of AR to update warehouse inventory, and later, could try an app that allows users to try on clothing virtually.\nMaking it Memorable\nOne of the most popular points of the Walmart Experience was the 4D ride that came at the end of the walkthrough, something Kenyon says almost didn\u2019t happen. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would survive the scrutiny over the year,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it did. It stuck and it\u2019s a hit. It\u2019s been run about 75 times a day; it\u2019s been packed every single day.\u201d\nRead More: Memorable Events Wash Ashore on the Central Coast\nKenyon said he wanted to create a memorable experience. All the talk about drone delivery\u2014Walmart has completed about 20,000 across seven U.S. states to date\u2014and watching the videos of the conveyor belts in the distribution centers sparked the idea of a 4D ride. Leo partnered with a park manufacturing company that has created rides for malls and amusement parks, small and large; it uses the same technology used as Disneyworld and EPCOT.\nSimilar to a ride you may experience at Disneyland or Universal Studios, Walmart\u2019s 4D ride was an immersive four-minute-and-forty-second experience that took riders along for the journey as strawberries went through the supply chain: from being grown on a farm, to \u00a0being taking through the manufacturing process in Walmart\u2019s fulfillment centers, to \u00a0being distributed to individual Walmart stores and eventually being sold to customers.\nThe 4D aspect came into play throughout the entire experience. Two rows of seats moved in all directions as visitors saw aerial shots of farms and distribution centers. Mist and air emerged from vents in front of arm rests to mimic coasting through the clouds, and the smell of strawberries wafted throughout the room via air filtration and air compression of strawberry-scented pellet packs as the on-screen strawberries made their way into a strawberry cake as part of a birthday celebration.\nLeo handled the production of the video, picking the facilities the video would be shot in and using drones piloted by a professional drone racer to take aerial shots of the farms, distribution centers and residential neighborhoods.\nAccording to Kelly Rothberger, senior associate producer for Leo, who played a large role in the construction of the activation, the ride will live on beyond CES. Its next stop is Arkansas, where shareholders will get to enjoy a viewing.\nBe the First to Know\nEverything you need in one beautiful print and digital magazine\nJan 16, 2024\nJan 9, 2024\nJan 9, 2024\nJan 8, 2024\nJan 5, 2024\nBe in touch with the hottest topics around & the breaking news around the world.\nAbout Us\nResources\nSocial Media\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Walmart Highlights Its Use of New Tech with a 4D Film\nIn 2019 (which happened to mark my first visit to CES), Google hosted a dark ride aptly named The Google Assistant Ride. So, when I heard that Walmart\u2019s CES pavilion included a 4D ride, I was intrigued. Alas, this pop-up attraction wasn\u2019t quite as impressive as some past CES rides.\nBefore I get to the ride itself, I do want to mention that the rest of the pavilion was actually pretty interesting. Upon entry, guests could see a bit of Walmart\u2019s history along with how the company embraced certain technologies along the way. Incidentally, I actually knew some of this history having visited the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas. After this short exhibit, guests could then explore some of the tech Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club locations are currently employing. For example, we were able to pick up smartphones and demo an AR technology that Walmart team members are using to quickly scan boxes and know what needs to be stocked. There were also mini games along the way, such as one where guests would try their hand at efficiently packing a pallet. Luckily, this was all digital \u2014 so no heavy lifting was required.\nAfter a few other sections, 20 guests at a time were welcomed into a theatre for our 4D adventure. Like any \u201c4D\u201d film, this attraction included moving seats, scents, and sprays. And when I say \u201csprays,\u201d I mean it as the mist emitted was not messing around.\nAs for the story of the ride, it seemed to be loosely based around a family gathering or party. In reality, though, it was simply a fly through highlighting some of the ways modern Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club facilities function. Early on, this included a Land Pavilion-esque scene showing produce. Later, we saw fresh strawberries make their way onto the truck and into the refrigerated section of your local Sam\u2019s Club. We also paid a visit to a Walmart shipping facility, following around boxes on their journey.\nYou may be wondering why exactly this film needed to be a flyover. Well, if I had to guess, I\u2019d say it has something to do with one of the final scenes. In it, we see how Walmart is currently testing drone delivery technology. As the film stated, the company has already completed more than 20,000 safe deliveries using this unique medium.\nAll in all, the Walmart 4D CES attraction wasn\u2019t too thrilling, but did have its moments. A highlight for me was a scene with a delicious looking cake that we also got to smell thanks to the 4D effects. Also, while a lot of the ride was really a recap of what\u2019d we\u2019d already learned, I still found some of the facts and examples to be genuinely interesting.\nIn all likelihood, this experience was probably a one-time thing. However, perhaps a similar ride could be brought to life in Bentonville? If not, it won\u2019t be a big loss \u2014 but props to Walmart for at least attempting to bring some theme park-like fun to this year\u2019s CES.\nItem of the Day\nArendelle Starbucks\u00ae Mug \u2013 Been There Series \u2013 Frozen\nFossil | Disney Valentine\u2019s Day Collection \u2013 January 15th\nMost Popular"
