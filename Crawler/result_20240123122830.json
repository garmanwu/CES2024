        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "2023D: Leia\u2019s Year of Groundbreaking 3D Achievements\nA Year of Unprecedented Achievements\nAs we look back on 2023, it's clear that it was a year of transformative achievements here at Leia. Each milestone, from strategic acquisitions to influential partnerships, has been a step towards a future where 3D technology is not just an option but a norm. Here\u2019s just a few of those achievements:\n\u200d\n\u200d1. Pioneering Partnerships: Joining Forces with ZTE for the Nubia Pad 3D / Lume Pad 2\n2023 kicked off with a game changing partnership with ZTE, marking our foray into global consumer technology with the Nubia Pad 3D. This collaboration, accompanied by four CES\u00ae 2023 Innovation Awards for Leia\u2019s technology, highlights our joint commitment to transcending the barriers of traditional digital content and ushering in the evolution of 3D.\nOur collaboration with ZTE is more than a partnership; it's a testament to our shared vision of making immersive 3D experiences accessible to all. The Nubia Pad 3D, equipped with Leia\u2019s switchable 2D and 3D technology, is a glimpse into a future where eyewear-free 3D viewing is not just a possibility but a reality, anywhere, anytime.\n\u200d\n2. A Quantum Leap in 3D Technology: Industry Leaders Join Forces\n2023 marked a pivotal moment for Leia with the strategic acquisition of Dimenco. This strategic move united two vanguards in the 3D world, catapulting the possibilities of immersive experiences into the mainstream. Together, we've been working to seamlessly blend our respective strengths, with Leia's foothold on the Android platform complementing Dimenco's expertise in Windows-based systems.\nLeia CEO, David Fattal, expressed an emphasis on our commitment to better aligning digital experiences to our 3D reality. This acquisition doesn't just merge technologies; it merges visions, ambitions, and, most importantly, our promise to deliver a unified, cross-platform 3D experience.\nFurther sweetening this milestone is the expansion of our content ecosystem. Imagine making a 3D video call via Zoom, streaming 3D movies, or sharing 3D photos \u2014 all soon to be accessible across a wider range of devices. We're setting the bar high and just getting started when it comes to establishing industry standards for 3D technology.\n\u200d\n3. Expanding Our Intellectual Property: Acquisition of Philips' 3D Display Patents\nOur quest to revolutionize the 3D display landscape saw another significant leap with the acquisition of Royal Philips' 3D display patent portfolio. This move, adding over 500 patents to our repository, fortifies our position as the leader in 3D display technology.\nThese patents aren't just numbers; they are beacons of innovation that will pave the way for advanced developments in 3D display technology. As we integrate these patents with our Simulated Reality (LeiaSR) technology, we're not only enhancing our product line \u2014 we're setting new benchmarks for the industry. This acquisition underscores our commitment to transitioning from a 2D > 3D viewing experience, making for a more immersive and intuitive experience.\n\u200d\n\u200d4. The Year of AI and 2M+ LeiaPix Creators\nThis year we saw incredible growth in the generative AI space with over two million of you taking your images and converting them into 3D magic! It\u2019s safe to say the world has gone spatial and we\u2019re proud to see our community at the forefront of this movement. We\u2019ve seen depth animations, tutorials, narrative storytelling, and depth map-to-mesh projects turning images into immersive volumetric scenes. Part of what drives our team is seeing your enhanced creative experience and so we have some great updates to share in the coming months that will take it even further.\n\u200d\n\u200dLeaping Into 2024\nOur journey goes beyond technological advancements; each achievement supports our mission of bringing people closer to a world where digital interactions are as real and immersive as the world around them. As we jump into 2024, we do so with the promise of continuing to innovate, inspire, and lead in the world of 3D technology.\nWishing our community a happy and prosperous 2024. May the new year bring you new dimensions of immersive experiences!"

At this year\u2019s CES 2024 in Las Vegas, one company, Leia Inc., demonstrated a better way where 3D worlds \u201cpop off\u201d a true 3D display \u2013 without needing a heavy headset or glasses.\nFounded in 2014 and the winner of four CES 2023 Innovation Awards, Leia continues to remain a leading provider of \u201cglasses-free\u201d 3D display hardware and content services for mobile devices and automotive.

Esposito recently served as the CEO of Luxexcel, which is now part of Meta Platforms, leading the company\u2019s turnaround and strategic pivot towards smart eyewear.\nDavid Fattal, the company\u2019s former CEO, will remain with the company overseeing Leia\u2019s 2D-to-3D switchable display solutions, software development kit (SDK) and AI cloud services as he assumes the role of Chief Technology Officer.\nThis announcement also comes after Leia\u2019s October acquisition of Dimenco B.V., the 3D Display patent portfolio of Royal Philips, which includes more than 500 patents. This, in combination with Leia\u2019s existing patent portfolio, brings the total number of its held patents to over 1,500, making the company the largest and most significant 3D display and software portfolio in the industry, further strengthening its IP positioning in 3D display technology.\nWhile the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the acquired patents will accelerate adoption of Leia\u2019s Simulated Reality technology (SRTM), which is currently being integrated into mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop displays. According to the company, it has also started to actively license its technology to display manufacturers and OEMs such as ZTE, Acer, and Asus, who are looking to offer full 3D solutions to its customers.\nThe Lume Pad 2\u2019s Debut at SXSW 2023\nWe spoke with Leia and Fattal last year during SXSW 2023 in Austin, Texas, having the opportunity to review the company\u2019s newest flagship 2D-3D tablet, the Lume Pad 2, ahead of its public release. Having personally and actively used the Lume Pad 2 for the past year, there\u2019s no question as to why this was by far one of the best 3D AI innovations that came out of 2023 \u2013 even with its price tag of $1,099.\nOver the past few years, companies have touted product after product \u2013 all claiming to have made the 3D experience more \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201ceasy to experience.\u201d Yet, the overall experience that most consumers have faced \u2013 the eyestrain, headaches, and dizziness \u2013 haven\u2019t changed.\nUntil the Lume Pad 2 came around. The \u201cglasses-free\u201d device allows wearers to experience realistic 3D technology without many of these concerns, separating the CES award-winning company from most of the products available in the market.\nDuring CES 2024, Leia showcased a 3D racing simulation on the SR Pro 2, a cutting-edge 8K 3D panel that upgrades the overall gaming experience, strapping players into the racing seat and watching the magic of its latest hardware \u2013 LeiaSR\u2122. While driving, players were able to feel the corners and sense the car spinning on-track with the stunning 3D visuals.\nFrom high-octane first-person shooters to strategic simulations, CES attendees were able to witness the seamless integration of 3D into some of their favorite games, showcasing how LeiaSR can be integrated into laptops and tablets to help elevate the visual and immersive impact of gaming.\nUltimately, 3D isn\u2019t a new technology, but the way Leia does it is.\nRelated\nShare:\nRate:\nAbout The Author\nAndrew Rossow is an attorney and the CEO of AR Media.

        "raw_content": "The New Leia and the Future of 3D\nFollowing Leia\u2019s recent acquisition of Dimenco, David Fattal, CEO of Leia Inc., and Maarten Tobias, Leia\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer (and former CEO of Dimenco), sat down to discuss how far 3D display technology has come in the past year, and what this acquisition means for the future of the industry.\nBesides the acquisition, we saw the launch of Dimenco-powered ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 at CES and Leia's Lume Pad 2 at MWC, both shifted the conversation to be about uses cases and costs. What else has changed in the 3D space over the past year?\nMaarten Tobias (MT): To begin with, \u201c3D\u201d isn\u2019t a dirty word in the industry like it was a few years ago. Now, though, the world is ready for it and acting to it.\nWith Apple Vision Pro \u2013 and what Nvidia is doing \u2013 3D is coming back. Our technology at both Leia and Dimenco over the last 12 months has evolved so much that the quality is not a discussion anymore, it however took more than 10 years to get here, confirming that not many companies are able to do this.\nDavid Fattal (DF): It proves that we\u2019ve both been on the right track all along as separate companies. That all starts with showing the difference good, personalized 3D can make for content.\nI agree, \u201c3D\u201d isn\u2019t a dirty word anymore! After an initial phase of inflated expectations around 2010-2014, 3D went through a period of disillusionment from which we are still recovering. But both Maarten and I are seeing that we have now embarked in an informed phase of enlightenment, with companies like Acer and ZTE launching products in the market: that are receiving very positive feedback from end consumer and ecosystem partners.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence, a lot of investment has gone directly or indirectly into the 3D ecosystem in the last few years, in gaming engines like Unity and Unreal, in compute with ever more powerful GPUs, in cloud and network infrastructure, and in VR/AR related tech. But perhaps two specifics to highlight are 1) the mastery of 3D display tech that can switch seamlessly to 2D, no more suffering image degradation for normal 2D content, and 2) the emergence of generative AI techniques for image processing, allowing magical things like on-device real-time 2D3D content conversions. We can safely say that old technical and content barriers to 3D have been lifted, at least for personal devices which is the focus of the company\u2026\nWhat do you mean by personal devices?\nDF: We mean any display meant for personal use, as opposed to shared (multiviewer) use. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, monitors, automotive and inflight infotainment\u2026all familiar devices that you are already interacting with intuitively in your daily life. We are staying out of larger screens meant for multi-viewers like TV sets, but we think our market is already very large!\nAt the most basic level, it\u2019s about delivering an incredible 3D experience, meant to blow away the person in front of the screen. In our case, a big part of that was incorporating eye-tracking into our devices. In the past, we used a passive screen that worked well-enough. However, dedicating the front-facing cameras to eye-tracking in the Lume Pad 2 opened up incredible clarity and crispness. It made the whole experience much more pleasing to the eye.\nWhile Leia has already established a robust content ecosystem, everything we have in place extends even further now that we\u2019ve incorporated eye-tracking. This includes 3D movie streaming featuring top-tier Hollywood titles, 3D photo sharing, a generative AI platform, and of course, games with great studios such as Gameloft. Then there\u2019s 3D video calling in partnership with Zoom. Video chat, in particular, is a great use-case for widespread adoption because once you experience the emotion and connection from a 3D video chat, it\u2019s really hard going back to 2D.\nMT: Common requests we receive frequently from customers are for 3D chat and 3D video-conferencing. And we\u2019ve also been targeting that...separately prior to this acquisition, but now, together, as\u00a0 a great unified solution. We\u2019re not there yet, but with the integration of both these companies we\u2019re getting closer.\n\u200d\nDid you talk about things like this at events in the past, prior to the recent acquisition?\nMT: The 3D display space until now is a small market. It\u2019s always been very friendly. We both have the same drive, passion and at the time we had a different approach, but we respected each other and we knew that we both had a common goal. Even when we were in competition, we knew that we\u2019d have to work together instead of fighting each other. Better to create a bigger pie for both of us than to have two much smaller slices.\nDF: [laughing] For a long time, I\u2019d see our two companies as competing chess masters. Both extremely good at what we do and planning out moves. I always had respect for what Dimenco produced and had such a great time whenever speaking with Maarten.\u00a0 The more we talked over time, the more we realized what we had in common.\n\u200d\nSo, David, you had an inkling for a while. Maarten, what happened when the acquisition conversation started?\nMT: When Leia approached us about the acquisition, it was a bit of a shocker \u2013 something we had to process \u2013 but we quickly realized that it made a lot of sense. A lot of customers we\u2019d been speaking with were considering multiple options. So, when you have two of the market leaders competing for the same business and pushing different technologies, some could choose to wait and see which company will win out.\nDF: These customers were excited by the fact we were joining forces. We\u2019d hear things such as, \u201cGreat! Now we don\u2019t have to choose one over the other.\u201d It unlocked conversations about making new products, but more importantly, it also brought us towards creating a standard for 3D in the market as the category leader.\n\u200d\nDavid, you mentioned that you had so much in common, were you referring to the technologies you employ? The company culture?\nDF: Honestly, both. We can talk about the technologies in a moment, but as a company we\u2019ve always referred to ourselves as a family. The Leia family started with employees and we extended that same sentiment to our community as well.\nMT: Dimenco had a similar approach. There\u2019s already a strong connection\u00a0 \u2013 not just between David and myself, but also across the teams, possibly a result of Leia having a company culture that\u2019s radically similar to ours.\nOf course, Leia acquired Dimenco, but most of the people communicate to us that culturally it feels like a merger. That also shows that we are like-minded on the market and how we want to address it.\n\u200d\nHow do you see the newly formed larger Leia immediately benefitting as you address the market together?\nDF: Previously, Leia focused on Android, catering to the mobile and automotive markets. Dimenco, meanwhile, led on Windows-based laptops and monitors for professional use. At every level, we are truly combining our strengths to address a broader market.\nFor instance, Leia\u2019s software and 3D\u2022AI accomplishes so much when leveraging our panels. We see it all as very complimentary technology that will hugely benefit all hardware for all the platforms we tackle.\nMT: In the past, as Dimenco, we\u2019d provide the APIs and rely on strong partners to create apps to leverage our screens. But moving forward we\u2019ll have a team in place, already addressing the software side that will create additional hooks specifically for our technology. It\u2019ll make for a much cleaner experience overall.\nOne of our objectives is to port Leia\u2019s applications to our platform and vice versa. Both have strengths and LeiaChat is part of that. We\u2019re keen to get LeiaChat quickly to all platforms, including devices already out in the marketplace.\nThe Leia Appstore is a perfect example of how we\u2019re complimentary. Merging what Leia\u2019s done for Android and Dimenco for Windows into one will go relatively quickly because we have the same basic principles.\n\u200d\nWhat are some of your shared basic principles, from your perspectives?\nDF: The way we look at the technology \u2013 the image processing \u2013 is similar. It\u2019s funny because we are two different companies, but there\u2019s a lot of overlap in how we handle the background tasks to make 3D work in our separate solutions. The way we\u2019ve organized, we separately had some of the same specialties and focus areas.\nFrom the beginning, Leia focused its Lightfield efforts on a backlit display. Dimenco\u2019s display technology itself was always sitting on the top layer and that, combined with the image processing they had done, got Dimenco to where it is ...and there was a lot of overlap.\nLeia, going forward, is moving away from the backlighting 3D aspect and pushing that layer towards the front with future iterations. So that helps bring yet another aspect of how we\u2019re working together into alignment.\nMT: From my perspective, Leia is a great partner from both the application / software side, but also manufacturing. There\u2019s a big, strong operations team that we simply did not have on our own.\n\u200d\nWhat will CES 2024 and the rest of next year look like for the new Leia?\nMT: We will be much more present and visible in 2024 first, with other OEMs. In the coming three-to-nine months, you\u2019re going to see more vendors offering 3D solutions coming out of our new organization. Either proof-of-concepts or new product announcements, shipping in high-volume in 2024.\nDF: This truly is the beginning of something great and we can\u2019t wait until everyone gets to see what\u2019s coming \u2014 2024 is going to be an exciting one for 3D! I can\u2019t wait to share more soon.\n\u200d"

CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 08 and features about 3,200 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 100,000 attendees. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund pours another $590 M into Magic Leap. This is happening just as Apple prepares to go head-to-head with Magic Leap with the February 2 launch of the Apple Vision Pro. Exactly one year ago, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned sovereign wealth fund added $450 M to its previous investment, giving them a fifty percent stake and overall control. This investment was not about more control, it was about giving the new CEO, Ross Rosenberg, a chance to build a business around this amazing technology in search of applications. Having awkwardly straddled the prosumer segment with limited success, in mid-2020 founder and CEO Abovitz laid off half the company and fell on his sword (resigned). Microsoft\u2019s Executive VP of Business Development, Peggy Johnson, took the reins as CEO. Soon thereafter, in 2021, $500 M of fresh funding flowed into the company, giving her running room do develop a slimmer, more focused company. Johnson supervised the launch of the critically acclaimed Magic Leap 2 and shifted the company\u2019s focus to enterprise. Today, Magic Leap says it\u2019s mainly focused on medical applications, while seeking to expand in other verticals. Johnson resigned in mid-2023, saying she had accomplished her mission there.\nRoss Rosenberg, CEO, Magic Leap\nIn an interview with VentureBeat\u2019s Dean Takahasi, the new CEO, Ross Rosenberg, said \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the third chapter in Magic Leap\u2019s history. Chapter one was about invention and the breakthroughs that were created under Rony. Chapter two was about productizing those inventions. We now have Magic Leap Two. Chapter three is about commercial adoption of that technology, which goes to customer use cases.\u201d Yikes. That\u2019s putting lipstick on a pig if I\u2019ve ever heard it. They\u2019ve been trying to commercialize the new Magic Leap 2 headset for three years. Johnson left because they\u2019re not making enough money. Rosenberg\u2019s no fool. He wouldn\u2019t have taken the job without new funding. My read is that this is some of the worst funding news in tech. If Magic Leap can\u2019t right itself with this kind of money, what is it going to take? Microsoft can afford to move on from the HoloLens, but that\u2019s all Magic Leap has got. [Full disclosure, fomer CEO Abovitz is co-host of my \u201cThis Week in XR\u201d podcast. He never breathes a word about Magic Leap. The topic is a third rail. He\u2019s shared nothing, and I don\u2019t ask.

Instead, this new breed of display uses eye tracking to create the effect and it is, well, effective. In early 2023 Leia acquired its biggest competitor, Dimenco, which was taking a similar approach to PCs as Leia was with tablets. Esposito joins the company as 3D without glasses becomes more of a thing, as this year\u2019s CES certainly demonstrated. Leia must be in good shape, since they don\u2019t appear to need a $500M investment to attract a new CEO.\nKopin CEO Michael Murray rings the bell at NASDAQ close to singal new direction for company.\nKopin [KOPN] Rings Bell at NASDAQ To Signal New Direction.

Kopin has undergone some significant changes, which Murray shared in an interview earlier today. Fan stepped down as CEO two years ago and now heads a Chinese spin-off in which Kopin owns a minority stake.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
