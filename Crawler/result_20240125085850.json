It\u2019s one of the very few arguments we have. On a whim, I ordered this to see if I could get him to use a water flosser, thinking if nothing else, I\u2019ll use it. As soon as this arrived, I set it up. It is really easy to put together. The water tank locks on with a twist. I like that it detaches because the larger hole makes it WAY easier to clean.\nEvery time I go to my dentist, he asks if I flossed every day. I tell him before I go to his office, which means obviously no. I decided to order this item, since it looked very easy to use and I really liked the black color. Upon using I noticed the water pressure was very strong at the tip. The amount of debris that came out of my teeth was impressive and was far cleaner than before using this water flosser. Comes with 4 tips, 2 tip cases, and a USB charger. Works with power banks. The size is very compact and is travel size., since it is cordless. This flosser, comes with 3 modes, so you can chose one to your liking. I liked the soft mode the best, since the normal mode is very strong. Gets the job done and satisfies the dentists minimum request to care for your teeth. Highly recommended to improve dental hygiene.\nThey have three setting \u2013 normal, slow and pulse. Normal is very hard, I\u2019m sure it would be perfect for most people \u2013 I use it on most of my teeth, but I have some implants (because of an old accident) and it\u2019s way too strong of a stream around them. The soft works mostly for them. It doesn\u2019t leak. The ends are easy to change. It\u2019s easy to charge. I recommend using it in the shower (which is what my dentist suggested) as it goes everywhere! I turned it on in the bathroom initially over the sink and it was only on for a few seconds and the place got soaked.\nSo far, so good. I received it about a month ago. My dental hygienist recommended a water flosser and told me not to spend a lot of money. I found this one and I\u2019m very satisfied. The reservoir is large and detachable which makes cleaning and filling easy. The strength of the water on \u201cnormal\u201d is strong enough to get food out from between the teeth (yes I tried). The battery lasted a solid 3 weeks before it needed charging -with use of at least once but mostly twice a day. For the price I think think was a good deal. I\u2019ll update this review if anything changes.\nNews\nNews\nWe have a regularly updated news section for any news on the oral care industry, the latest oral irrigator products announcement.\nehaitech2023-09-01T14:57:08+08:00September 1st, 2023|Comments Off on Oral Hygiene On-the-Go: Why Travel Water Flosser is an Opportunity?\nehaitech2023-07-28T14:38:20+08:00July 28th, 2023|Comments Off on Essential Water Flosser Tips For Dental Implant Oral Hygiene Care\nehaitech2023-07-28T14:40:48+08:00July 6th, 2023|Comments Off on Why Dental Irrigation: Oral Hygiene Can Lead To Health Problems!\nGet A Free Quote\nGet A Free Quote\nContact our oral care expert\uff0cfull capabilities to rely on\uff0cbest possible prices for you!\nSelect your country\nNo.28\uff0630bldg, Longwangmiao Industrial Park, Baishixia Community, Fuyong Town, Bao\u2019an District, Shenzhen\nPhone: Kyra | +86 18814488542\nMobile: Liu Xiao | +86 18814488484\nEmail: kyrawang@fly-cat.com.cn\nWeb:\nhttp://cn.fly-cat.com.cn\nContact Us"

The concept is a vision of a lower-carbon future. The company\u2019s return to CES, to be held January\u00a0 9-12 in Las Vegas, is intended to showcase its latest advancements in\u00a0energy transition solutions that customers may need to be successful in a reduced-carbon world.\n\u201cWe're learning, and we want to learn with our customers,\u201d\nsaid Mitch Tobias, Caterpillar Construction Industries strategy and planning\nmanager. \u201cThere's things that customers can do today, and there's things that\nwe're working on for tomorrow that's going to bring benefits as that comes.\u201d\nUltimately, it all comes down to the common quandary for a contractor of choosing the right size machine for the job that will still help save fuel costs and maybe reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nCat says it has been developing products focused on\u00a0productivity, performance, and efficiency.\n\"Sustainability also has been a very important category for Caterpillar for several years,\" said Mitch Tobias, Caterpillar's strategy and planning manager. \"We've really made that part of our daily DNA as we've been developing our products and how we're bringing those to market.\"\nOne of the reasons for that is the company knows that burning fuel just for the sake of burning fuel isn't necessarily the right thing to do.\n\"Not only is it good for business, but it's also good for sustainability. One of the best ways to not have emissions is to not burn excess fuel,\" Tobias said.\nSince 2011, Cat has published a sustainability report, leading the concept to be elevated to be the company\u2019s fourth area of focus in its enterprise strategy.\n\u201cCaterpillar is going to continue to expand options so customers can choose their machine choose their power for today and tomorrow,\u201d said Connie LaFlamme, Cat Global Sustainability Marketing market professional.\nCompared to previous generations of machines, Cat's current offerings have between 10% to 20% reduced fuel burn and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, more of the machines have telematics systems to manage and monitor fuel burn.\nThe ability to monitor each part of the ecosystem of the machine allows the company to provide advanced analytics, transforming data into customer insights making it easier for customers to own and operate their equipment.\n\u201cWe have a lot of technology built into our machines,\u201d LaFlamme said. \u201cIf you follow our tips on managing idle time, it's a large component of a machine\u2019s day-to-day life.\u201d\nThe 301.9 Electric mini excavator is powered by a Cat 48 volt, 32kWh battery with an approximate runtime of up to 8 hours based on average to moderate application use.Equipment World\nThe Cat experience\nAt the heart of the CES 2024 exhibit will be the battery-powered Cat\u00a0R1700 XE LHD underground loader and a 301.9 electric compact excavator.\nThe loader has a 16.5-ton payload and reaches a top speed of 11.2 mph. According to Cat, the battery charges in less than 20 minutes when paired with two of the mobile Cat MEC500 chargers.\nCat\u2019s compact electric excavator was first unveiled at Bauma 2022 as one of four prototype electric machines. Contractors had an opportunity to operate the 301.9 at Utility Expo. (Watch for an upcoming story on the model).\nThe company says the 301.9 Electric mini excavator is powered by a Cat 48 volt, 32kWh battery with an approximate runtime of up to 8 hours based on average to moderate application use. It has an onboard AC charger for overnight charging and there also is a DC fast-charging option.\n\u201cOur customer base is incredibly diverse, the markets, industries that we serve, there isn't a one size fits all solution when it comes to our battery offerings,\u201d said Dustin Childers, Caterpillar Industrial Power Systems Division global marketing manager.\nOne of the things that Cat is doing is exploring the different chemistry options that are available to determine the right battery solution while ensuring that those battery solution offerings are modular and scalable in nature for customers. That will help create consistency for the diverse fleets of equipment and industry uses.\nChilders noted that the durability of the battery packs also must be considered, based on the harsh conditions most of Cat\u2019s customers work in. Other critical pieces include the electronic components, the telematics, or digital service pieces which provide customers a viable solution to monitor and manage the battery systems.\nCaterpillar\nPlugged in\nA component of the energy transition journey is the assurance that some kind of charging infrastructure is in place. Cat will be featuring its lineup of charging solutions at CES, like the products displayed at ConExpo 2023.\n\u201cOne of the things that we want people to take away is that we are taking an approach as Caterpillar that as we release these battery electric machines to the market, we are going to provide our customers the same compatible charging solutions that they'll need for those machines at the time that the machines are released,\" said John Thomas, product application specialist Cat Electric Power Division. \u201cWe don't intend to leave that to our customers to go figure out on their own.\u201d\nCharging options for the electric models include the\u00a0Cat MEC500 Mobile Equipment Charger and the XEX60 compact energy storage solution or ESS.\n\u201cWe have what we call a compact ESS or energy storage solution, basically think of it as a battery in a box,\u201d Thomas said, referring to the XEX60.\nThe ESS units\u00a0can be used with any combination of diesel, natural gas, or renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. It is not powered by the grid it's charged from power generated onsite.\nAt ConExpo 2023, Cat displayed an ESS using solar panels to charge as an example of how a contractor could utilize the system at a site where there is no grid or utility connection.\nThat unit, the XEX60, a compact ESS, can be used in a couple of different ways. It can be set up with solar onsite or some other onsite power sources in the future such as hydrogen fuel cells or it can be taken back and forth on and offsite like a diesel storage tank.\n\"If you think of it as kind of an electric portable storage tank and so it can be taken off-site, charged or recharged and then taken back to the site which is connected to the machine as a charging power source,\" Thomas said.\nAlso being displayed at CES will be a Cat 750V electric motor and inverter, components that support a variety of machines and power systems. A 750 DC motor provides mechanical power for the machine's movement when commanded by the operator. The inverter transfers power to the electric motor from an onboard Cat machine power source like a generator or battery.\nFuture fuels\nDating back to the 1980s, Cat has been working with hydrogen and other lower carbon-intensity fuels.\n\u201cThe beauty of Caterpillar is that we like to share that information internally,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThe things that we start to learn about in a stationary power source we can also look to how we can apply that in mobile applications and bring those to customers where it makes sense.\u201d\nHe said Cat continues to work with customers to determine what solutions make sense for what applications, as well as what fuels. There is recognition that some customers may have easier access to a power grid, while others will have easier access to hydrogen.\nAdditional fuel options Cat is working with include\u00a0100% hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), B100 distilled biodiesel, and B100 standard biodiesel. Some of these are drop-in-ready options today without any retrofitting required.\nAs an example, the HVO itself does not reduce tailpipe emissions. However, over the lifecycle of a machine, in terms of sustainability, it is potentially better, according to Cat.\n\u201cThose are some of those things that we're here to help customers understand and educate them about,\" Childers said.\nMany contractors will step up and make the argument for reduced fuel emissions, however, those same customers are not necessarily educated about their varied fuel options.\n\"Many people are not familiar with current offerings that exist and how the different fuel types may work in equipment and how different reman service offerings help sustainability,\" Thomas said. \u201cI think it's a really big opportunity for our customers to get more understanding and educated about what it means to be sustainable.\u201d\nRecently,\u00a0Cat\u00a0announced the launch of\u00a0a\u00a0hydrogen-hybrid project\u00a0featuring the\u00a0Cat 13D\u00a0engine. Development of the project is slated to get underway in the first quarter of 2024.\nUnveiled at ConExpo 2023\u00a0the Cat C13D platform supports a variety of renewable fuel options in addition to hydrogen and natural gas.\nSlow change\n\"I think as you hear a lot of people talking about this energy transition it's not something that someone's going to walk in and decide we're going to flip the switch and everything's going to go to a different power source,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThere's a good reason that diesel fuel is an extremely dense power source, which is why it\u2019s used in so many applications.\u201d\nHe said diesel will be around for a while and as far as an energy transition goes, it will be a journey for both manufacturers and contractors as each transition through different types of products and technology.\n\u201cThat's why you see us doing the things that we're doing with these products, to enable us to bring the product that makes the most sense at the right time and in the right part of the journey that our customers are on,\u201d Tobias said."

        "raw_content": "Caterpillar brings electric equipment ecosystem to CES2024\nCaterpillar turned the heads of CES attendees with a monstrous, all-electric underground mining loader \u2013 but the real game-changer wasn\u2019t the big mining rig, or even the electric excavator. Instead, it was Cat\u2019s cutting-edge energy management systems to keep electric equipment charged up and ready to work.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to return to CES to showcase our advancements in energy solutions. This event is renowned as the proving ground for breakthrough technologies and global innovators, making it the ideal place for us to demonstrate our leadership in power systems and integrated service solutions, which help our customers in the energy transition,\u201d said Rod Shurman, senior vice president of Caterpillar\u2019s Electrification + Energy Solutions Division.\nTo that end, Caterpillar showcased a number of on-site generators capable of generating electric power to store in its battery energy storage system (BESS). Caterpillar says its BESS is designed for rapid plug-and-play installation and integration, compatible with any combination of diesel, natural gas, or renewable energy sources.\nGranted, fuel-agnostic energy storage is something most BESS products are capable of \u2013\u00a0but the concept of using on-site batteries for EV charging is still new enough that it might still be news to Cat\u2019s customers. In fairness, Cat\u2019s big BESS offers a comprehensive array of charging ports, making it compatible with almost any EV, charging it in about 20-40 minutes.\nCaterpillar also showcased several smaller DC chargers designed to be compact enough for a single worker to wheel up to a piece of electric equipment and charge it with electrons in about three hours.\nSpeaking of electric equipment, Caterpillar also brought out an electric drive mini excavator fitted with a jackhammer implement meant to show fleet buyers that their legacy Cat accessories would still work once they made the transition to electric \u2013\u00a0but note: Cat\u2019s excavator isn\u2019t fully electric.\nCat 301.9 electric mini excavator\nUnlike the fully-electric equipment concepts shown by Doosan Bobcat and HD Hyundai, which use electric actuators and gears to move their boom arms, the Cat 301.9 uses an electric motor to power its wheels and accessories, but still relies on conventional hydraulic oils to manipulate its arm \u2013\u00a0and that can be a problem in cold climates.\n\u201cThe electric motors don\u2019t make as much heat as the diesels,\u201d explained \u201cGreg,\u201d one the Caterpillar SMEs on the ground at CES2024. \u201cSo it can take a long time to warm up the hydraulics.\u201d\nThis might seem like a rookie mistake, but Greg clarified, \u201cThese are still really new. The first two or three I drove were converted diesel units. This is one of the first ones that was built electric from the start.\u201d\nTo Caterpillar\u2019s credit, sticking to hydraulic operation will make it easier for operators familiar with Cats to switch to electric. The fact that the hydraulic accessories fleet operators already own will work with the new electric 301.9 also helps lower the EV\u2019s barrier to entry.\nThe 301.9 mini excavator was displayed alongside its 48 volt on-board battery pack, which offers a total capacity of 32 kWh and delivers 3 hours\u2019 of continuous runtime \u2013\u00a0which is just enough to handle a full working shift above ground.\nBelow ground, you\u2019ll want something a little bigger.\nCat R1700 XE LHD underground loader\nThe crown jewel of Caterpillar\u2019s CES exhibit this year was the massive Cat R1700 XE LHD underground loader. The R1700 XE LHD offers a whopping 16.5-ton payload and a top speed just over 11 mph \u2013 a nightmare-fast speed in the tight confines of a dark underground mine, the loader\u2019s natural habitat.\nThe good news is that you won\u2019t have your lungs getting choked out by diesel fumes while you try to escape from the big Cat, because this is the only underground loader in the industry powered by onboard battery that can charge in less than 20 minutes when it\u2019s hooked up to two of the big Cat MEC500 chargers we talked about at the beginning of this article.\nThis is the first of this type of Cat battery packs, which the company claims are a modular design that will power future electric equipment models, as well as with factory integrated telematics and a\nstructure durable to endure the challenges of the job site.\nElectrek\u2019s Take\nTop comment by Mattia Francesco Bruni\nGood to know - being a machine operator the thing you hate most is smell and noise. Noise of the Hydraulic will still be there though.\nThe use of container contained batteries for charging equipment seems really clever anyway, Redox flow batteries would make a lot of sense in that case - especially on a city centre site; charging several excavator and dumper could easily get the grid down.\nCaterpillar isn\u2019t the only heavy equipment OEM hard at work developing a total job site solution to keep its new EVs charged up \u2013 but it did a fantastic job convincing people at CES that they were, and I wanted one of the bright blue CAT trucker caps badly enough not to say anything about it to their face.\nThat said, I got the chance to have Volvo Penta\u2019s Darren Tasker as a guest on The Heavy Equipment Podcast to talk about Volvo Penta\u2019s efforts to bring more sustainable, lower emission energy to remote job sites. Trust that other companies in the space, surely, are doing the same.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Electrification, as well as other alternative fueled machines, are the future. When companies the size of Caterpillar makes moves like this, it's not based on a whim, or a passing fad. With that in mind, at this year's CES 2024, Caterpillar's display will primarily focus on the new electrically powered machinery and the energy based solutions required in order to meet the ever-changing needs of the industry.\nAs jobsites increasingly turn towards electrification as a tool, Caterpillar wants to continue to be a leader in the sector, as they have been in others for nearly a hundred years. According to the company, their investment into this field comes from a long history of innovation, which now takes the form of things like connectivity and other digital solutions for the modern high-tech work site.\nFrom the company's press release:\n\u201cWe are delighted to return to CES to showcase our advancements in energy solutions. This event is known as the proving ground for breakthrough technologies and global innovators which makes it the ideal place for us to showcase our leadership in power systems and integrated service solutions to help our customers in the energy transition,\u201d said Rod Shurman, Senior Vice President of Caterpillar\u2019s Electrification + Energy Solutions division. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our expertise to work on multiple advanced power technologies to enable the energy transition solutions that our customers need to be successful in a reduced-carbon world.\u201d\nProvided by CAT\nThe true centerpiece of their exhibition space will be the CAT R1700 XE LHD, which is an underground loader, offering a nearly 17 ton payload and a top speed of 11 miles per hour. The loader is zero-emission, and has an on board battery which should eliminate the need to handle or switch out any battery units.\nThe question on everyone's mind when it comes to new electric equipment is always centered around charging times. In that regard, the RX1700 XE LHD is capable of charging in as little as 20 minutes when it is hooked up to two of the durable and easily transported CAT MEC500 chargers. Those models are standalone energy solutions specifically engineered for quick and safe \"refueling\" of electric CAT equipment.\nThese and other Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) can be used alongside a combination of diesel, natural gas, or renewable sources of energy like solar or wind power. They are capable of storing excess power from those sources of energy, and then safely transfer its reserves when and where it is needed. For example, the XEX60 ESS will be on display at CES.\nAccording to Caterpillars' press release: The on-board battery pack on display at CES is designed to power the 301.9 mini excavator with a total capacity of 32 kWh and a nominal voltage of 48 volt. Cat battery packs consist of a modular design with factory integrated telematics and a rugged structure to endure the use on our heavy equipment.\nAs Caterpillar continues to invest in job sites of the future, the company is growing its team.

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nCES 2024 in Las Vegas is the place to see the latest and often the most surprising developments in consumer technology. Our team has searched high and low for the very best, highlighting our top picks with our 2024 CES Reviewed Awards.\nWe\u2019re also keeping an eye out for the new and unusual innovations. Here are some of the promising and sometimes quirky tech products from CES that we can\u2019t wait to test in 2024.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\nTurn up the heat on mosquito bites with Heat It\nNow doctor-approved.\nMosquitoes can ruin your time outdoors. The little bloodsuckers don\u2019t just steal blood; they leave saliva in the wound. Your allergic reaction to the bug drool causes the itchy misery. Anti-itch creams help but often aren\u2019t applied until it\u2019s too late.\nA fast, medication-free alternative that really worked has always been a pipe dream, but with their smart device, Heat It offers that solution, applying a dose of heat to the bug bite that stops the itch.\nWe were skeptical when we first heard about the device in 2023, as the scientific evidence for the tech was a little thin. Now Heat It is backed by a clinical trial showing it really can ease the symptoms.\nThe device plugs into your smartphone, you press it against the bite, and the accompanying app controls the dose of heat. You have to act fast for good results, and the heat can border on painful. Despite that, for most users, it probably beats days of discomfort, and we can\u2019t wait to try it out during bug season.\nDiscover the iPhone version of this mosquito bite healer\nThe mosquito bite healer is also compatible with Android smartphones\nMirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s my blood pressure today?\nYour health at a glance.\nWhat if you could get heart health data at a glance, or at least with a short video clip? Sounds too good to be true, but NuraLogix claims they can do just that with their Anura MagicMirror.\nThe idea isn\u2019t as far-fetched as it seems. The thin skin on our faces is translucent, and as blood pulses through the vessels there are subtle color changes. The MagicMirror uses cameras and sophisticated software to measure heart rate and blood pressure from color changes in video images.\nChanges in heart rate and blood pressure are linked to other factors, like stress and heart health. Those links are complicated, so the further you get away from basic measurements, the greater the chance of errors creeping in. Even so, we\u2019re excited about the possibilities of this new technology and look forward to testing it in 2024.\nGenesis makes it rain (kind of) with their water capture device\nNo need to wait for the rain anymore.\nImagine getting water direct from the atmosphere. I know what you\u2019re thinking: it\u2019s called rain. But what if you could get the water whenever you wanted and purified?\nThat\u2019s what Genesis offer with their WC-100 WaterCube, an innovation award winner at CES 2024.\nUnder the right conditions (80 degrees F and 60% relative humidity), the WaterCube can extract over 100 gallons of purified water from the air every day. Water is an increasingly scarce and expensive resource, so having a personal water supply for your house could be vital.\nAtmospheric water extraction is a great concept, but it comes at a cost. The WC-100 will retail at $19,995, and it\u2019s pretty energy-hungry. It uses 1 kWh per gallon of water produced and needs a beefy 220V electrical supply on a 40 Amp breaker.\nIf you\u2019re looking for off-grid self-sufficiency, the power demands call for a hefty solar or other renewable energy source. Despite this potential challenge, Genesis offers a forward-thinking solution to water scarcity with their advanced atmospheric water extraction technology.\nWalk this way, you\u2019re doing it wrong\nA new way to read your exercises.\nWhen it comes to exercise, fitness trackers mostly focus on quantity, not quality. The Evolve Mvmt, announced at CES 2024, goes far beyond counting your steps and encouraging you to move more \u2014 it promises to improve each step you take.\nEvolve Mvmt isn\u2019t a conventional fitness watch. It\u2019s worn on the ankle and measures the movement and impact of your foot while you walk. The device promises to use the data it collects to help you adjust your walking style\nThe impacts your feet experience during walking and running put a lot of strain on your joints and muscles, potentially leading to injury. The Mvmt gives real time feedback on how you\u2019re moving, encouraging a walking style they\u2019re calling \u201clight walking\u201d which aims to smooth out the bumps, improve your posture, and burn more calories.\nThere\u2019s still a lot to learn about this product, but that\u2019s why we have test labs. Another CES debut we\u2019ll be trying out in 2024.\nThe Flappie AI powered cat door lets your cat in but keeps other critters out\nYour cat will thank you for this one.\nCats are great. They\u2019re cute and affectionate, and only occasionally cough up hairballs on your stuff. Let them outside, though, and they\u2019ll be catching and bringing home a choice selection of dead wildlife in no time.\nIf you have an outdoor cat and the charm of finding dead mice in your home has worn off, Flappie Technologies has the solution you need with their smart cat flap.\nThe Flappie uses cameras and AI to figure out if your beloved cat is trying to carry a dead mouse indoors. If the AI detects a mouse, it locks the door until kitty spits out its prey. Finally, AI delivers on the promise to make our lives better.\nIt\u2019s not clear when Flappie will be available to buy in the US, but as soon as it is, we\u2019re eager to test it.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.
