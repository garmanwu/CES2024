        "raw_content": "CNN values your feedback\nMarkets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nIt\u2019s not just crime: What\u2019s really going on with San Francisco\u2019s shrinking retail district\nIn many ways, San Francisco\u2019s downtown is in dire straits. The city\u2019s Union Square neighborhood \u2014 once bustling with shoppers, diners, and tourists \u2014 has suffered from declining foot traffic and shuttered storefronts.\nStores in the area now have papered-over windows and \u201cRetail for Lease\u201d signs, according to Google Street View, which was last updated in June.\nWhile in-person activities in many major cities in the United States have rebounded since the start of the Covid pandemic, San Francisco\u2019s recovery has been strained. The downturn of the city\u2019s Union Square is a microcosm of that struggle.\nMapping the exodus\nUnion Square has historically been a major commercial hub in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s downtown. It serves as a venue for many public events and is seen as a go-to tourist attraction in the city due to its high-end shops, departments stores and hotels. But lately, many well-known chains have announced exits from the area, including CB2, Anthropologie, and Nordstrom.\nAccording to data provided to CNN by market research firm Coresight, nearly 40 retail stores have closed in Union Square\u2019s zip code since 2020, while dozens more have closed in the surrounding area.\nShopping mall operator Westfield gave up control of its San Francisco Centre mall in June. The company said its decision was due to \u201cchallenging operating conditions\u201d in the downtown area. In May, a Westfield mall spokesperson told CNN affiliate KGO-TV that store closures underscore \u201cthe deteriorating situation in downtown San Francisco.\u201d\n\u201cA growing number of retailers and businesses are leaving the area due to the unsafe conditions for customers, retailers and employees, coupled with the fact that these significant issues are preventing an economic recovery of the area,\u201d the spokesperson told KGO-TV.\nA complicated decline in downtown\nThe reasons for downtown San Francisco\u2019s economic troubles are multi-faceted. The city\u2019s working population has yet to return to the office at the same levels as other major cities, adding to a decline in foot traffic downtown. According to US Census estimates, many residents have left the city: San Francisco County\u2019s population declined by more than 60,000 people, or more than 7%, from 2020 to 2022.\nIn addition, San Francisco\u2019s downtown has experienced a rise in its unhoused population. Thirty percent of the nation\u2019s homeless population live in California, and most attribute their situations to the high cost of housing in the state, according to the results of a University of California, San Francisco survey released in June. The median sale price of a home in San Francisco is currently $1.32 million, making it 214% more expensive than the national average, according to data from Redfin.\nAs San Francisco\u2019s downtown area has emptied over the last three years, property crimes and retail thefts have risen, according to San Francisco Police Department data. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, whose corporate headquarters used to be in nearby Palo Alto, said in a recent tweet that San Francisco felt \u201cpost-apocalyptic.\u201d\nViolent crime in San Francisco has remained relatively low in recent years compared to other major cities in the United States, however.\nTourism slows down\nOne often-overlooked reason for the economic slowdown in Union Square is a drop in travelers since the pandemic.\nTravel to San Francisco has yet to recover fully to pre-pandemic levels, according to data from San Francisco International Airport.\nLori Lincoln, a vice president at San Francisco Travel \u2014 the official destination marketing organization for the county and city of San Francisco \u2014 said that her company estimates visitor spending from all countries will reach 2019 levels by 2024, and visitor volume is expected to recover by 2025.\nTourism is the largest generator of outside revenue for San Francisco, and tourism from Asia is an integral part of San Francisco\u2019s overall economy, Lincoln told CNN via email.\nTravelers from Asia outspent those from the Americas and Europe in San Francisco in 2019 and 2023, according to data compiled by Oxford Economics. In 2019, tourists from the Asia-Pacific region spent $3.1 billion in San Francisco and neighboring San Mateo counties, compared to $1.5 billion spent by European travelers and $1 billion spent by travelers from the Americas.\nEven though tourism from Asia hasn\u2019t fully rebounded yet, travelers from the Asia-Pacific still spent $1.9 billion in 2023, continuing to outspend tourists from the Americas and Europe, according to Oxford Economics.\nAccording to Lincoln, China, specifically, was San Francisco\u2019s largest overseas source of visitor spending in 2019.\nBut China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, which applied strict lockdowns to many of the country\u2019s major cities for more than two years, slowed travel to San Francisco \u2014 and most other places \u2014 to a near halt.\nTime for a turnaround?\nIn a statement to CNN, San Francisco Mayor London Breed\u2019s office said that \u201cwhile San Francisco continues to recover from very serious economic challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, Mayor Breed is encouraged by the significant progress the City has made to revitalize Downtown as part of her Roadmap to San Francisco\u2019s Future.\u201d\nBreed\u2019s plans include increasing office attendance by \u201cidentifying and recruiting strategic sectors that support San Francisco\u2019s resilience,\u201d including AI companies. Efforts to capitalize on the recent AI boom may already be paying off for the city. Alexander Quinn, senior director of research at commercial real estate company JLL, recently told CNN that his firm knows of 10 AI companies currently on the hunt for office space in San Francisco.\nBreed\u2019s plan also includes expanding the city\u2019s police force and amending city codes to convert some commercial buildings into residential properties. Breed suggested recently tearing down abandoned retail space, including the San Francisco Centre.\nBut while a flood of stores left San Francisco in recent years, the tide may be turning.\nChicago-based hotel investor Oxford Capital Group announced Tuesday that it would make a multimillion-dollar bet on San Francisco\u2019s downtown with the debut of four rebranded hotel properties in the area.\n\u201cWe are sanguine about the long-term prospects of downtown San Francisco, which has proven resilient over a number of economic cycles and challenges,\u201d said Sarang Peruri, the chief operating officer of Oxford Capital Group, in a statement.\nAdditionally, Ikea recently opened a three-level, 52,000-square-foot store just a few blocks from Union Square.\nBreed\u2019s office told CNN that the city is \u201cseeing progress,\u201d pointing to new businesses that have opened in Union Square.\n\u201cThe arrival of @IKEA is great news for the City\u2019s economic recovery that will bring local jobs and excitement to the Union Square area,\u201d Breed tweeted. \u201cWe are thrilled to welcome IKEA to be part of San Francisco\u2019s future.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to reporting\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.
