This year\u2019s theme is Human Security for All, which emphasizes the critical role technology plays in making the world safer and more sustainable for everyone, encompassing topics from environmental protection to healthcare access and food security. With keynote conversations featuring leaders in technology, consumer goods and healthcare spaces, CES 2024 invites us to consider how we can come together to engineer solutions that solve global human security issues.\nIn the opening keynote, Siemens AG CEO Dr. Roland Busch will kick off these conversations by revealing how combining the real and digital worlds empowers manufacturers everywhere to transform the everyday, for everyone. Throughout the four-day event, we\u2019ll dive into the various ways that Siemens technology is helping our customers make the world more accessible for all, with one of the key areas being the medical device industry. Read on for a sneak peak of what awaits at CES and discover more ways that Siemens digital solutions are reshaping the medical device and healthcare industries.\nUnlimited Tomorrow: Breaking barriers in access to prosthetics\nOur booth at CES will highlight multiple customer success stories from across industries. One story we\u2019re excited to share comes from Unlimited Tomorrow, a manufacturer of personalized, affordable prosthetic arms.\nThe traditional process of creating prosthetic limbs is costly and can take up to a year. For users who are children and may still be growing, this process can leave them with a prosthetic that no longer fits at the time of delivery. Using Siemens NX software, Unlimited Tomorrow is able to drastically shorten the time it takes to create a prosthetic. Unlimited Tomorrow makes it easy for users to order a prosthetic from the comfort of their home using a scan app on a mobile device. Once the scans are received, Unlimited Tomorrow designs a man/machine \u201csocket\u201d to fit the prosthetic to the patient\u2019s partial arm, 3D prints the prosthetic and ships it to the customer. They typically receive their lightweight prosthetic arm five times faster than the traditional process.\nHow additive manufacturing is reshaping the medical device industry\nUnlimited Tomorrow isn\u2019t the only example of how additive manufacturing can be used to transform the medical device industry and elevate patient care with high-quality, durable products. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to easily develop custom prosthetics, implants and orthopedic surgical guides that are as unique as the patients they serve.\nSimilar to the process of producing prosthetics, custom orthopedic surgical guides can also be created from patient scans and developed individually. Surgical cutting guides are used to limit cuts to a specific area, allowing surgeons to make precise cuts when removing a diseased or injured area of a bone before inserting a replacement. Traditionally, surgeons would use patient scans to determine the position and location of the cuts, then estimate what size of cutting guide is necessary. During the operation, they would then make the final decision about the size and position of the guide, selecting from a collection of generic sizes.\nWith additive manufacturing and modern design software, surgeons can use the same patient scan data to mold the cutting guide\u00a0to the shape of the patient\u2019s bone and virtually place it in the exact position necessary to make the most precise cut. The end result? Less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times for patients.\nAdditive manufacturing is also broadening the types of implant materials available. Traditional implants used in procedures such as knee replacements are bonded to the bone using a cement adhesive. This adhesive will gradually weaken over time, often leading to an implant replacement later down the line. Several companies are now using metal-based lattice structures to promote bone growth into knee, hip and shoulder replacements.\u00a0Lattice structures are three-dimensional arrangements of a material at a small scale. They form a scaffold-type structure that is lightweight yet strong. Medical companies including LimaCorporate have designed lattice structures that can integrate directly with new bone growth when used as implants. Unlike cement, this bond actually grows stronger over time, leading to long-term durability.\nEnhancing digital health security\nMedical devices are becoming a daily part of our lives, whether it\u2019s a patient using a device that connects to their cell phone to help manage a chronic condition, or healthcare professionals managing healthcare workflows. These devices make our lives easier and more connected, but they collect sensitive information that must be handled carefully. In order to protect patient safety and confidentiality, it\u2019s imperative that medical devices are secured against bugs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nSiemens Connected Care solutions equip medical device manufacturers with tools to improve the safety, quality and performance of their products. With our low-code application development platform, Mendix, and a robust cybersecurity framework, manufacturers can work collaboratively to build devices that enhance user experience and create apps for all forms of interaction \u2013 handheld to augmented reality. For the best user experience, our solutions improve device functionality and future-proof the software to ensure smooth upgrades.\nVisit Siemens at CES\nAre you attending CES 2024?

[+] at Sony, talk during a keynote address at the Venetian Resort during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 8, 2024. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe XR area at CES was not as big as it was last year, but it was still spread out over several venues and invitation-only hotel suites, making it impossible to see everything, even if you walk thirty miles in five days as I did.\nXreal's booth dominated the show floor in the area designated for XR/gaming/metaverse.\nA surprising number of companies, including stalwart HTC Vive, were absent, and fewer new players seems to be arriving on the scene. Consolidation and attrition are culling the herd as funding is flow to AI ventures. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the XR at CES is how unsurprising it is now. Immersive technologies have gone from being a potentially disruptive new thing to a CES staple.\nEmdor is a new mixed reality headset from China that is designed to imiitate the look of the Apple ... [+] Vision Pro, but that's where the comparison ends.\nThe biggest star of the XR area, The Apple Vision Pro, wasn\u2019t at CES, nor were Meta, Microsoft, Magic Leap, Rokid, Third Eye, or Lynx. Some of this is surprising, some not. Meta and Microsoft have their own developer conferences. Rokid just raised $70M. Perhaps they were busy doing other things. Pimax and Varjo were there, focused on prosumers and enterprise, where they are primarily used for training and simulation. HTC Vive, whose Elite headset is among the best in PCVR, was absent for the first time in ten years. Company execs Pearly Chen and Alvin Graylin were on panels at Digital Hollywood, but neither would comment on their company\u2019s absence. There were also several companies, like RealWear, that were only doing private demos in hotel suites.\nNew Samsung Leak Justifies Brave Galaxy S24 Ultra Downgrade\nNew Samsung Leak Reveals Powerful Galaxy S24 Ultra Design Decision\nSamsung s Galaxy S24 Ultra Will Deliver A Massive Smartphone Revolution\nKenichiro Yoshida, chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Group Corp., during the 2024 CES ... [+] event in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024. CES showcases companies including manufacturers, developers and suppliers of consumer technology hardware, content, technology delivery systems and more. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\nSony introduced its as-yet unnamed spatial content creation system, set for a 2024 launch. The headset, which will first be used exclusively by Siemens, looks a bit like the open-sided Quest Pro, but its visor flips up like the HoloLens 2. The system features a 4K OLED XR head-mounted display, a half dozen sensors and cameras, a ring controller, and a pointer, all powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon\u00ae XR2+ chip set. No word on the price or street date. Sony has a mega-booth at the edge of the Las Vegas Convention Center\u2019s Central hall. Reviewers lucky enough to be invited into the inner sanctum report the as-yet unnamed headset a serious competitor to the Vision Pro for enterprise applications.\nThe Xreal Ultra looks badass with its titanium rimmed Ultra smartglasses, launching this spring.\nXreal\u2019s New Ultra 6 DOF AR HMD Builds Momentum. We\u2019ve been following XReal\u2019s story since its founder and CEO, former Magic Leap engineer Chi Xu, boldly announced a $1,000 spatial computing device that took a lot of what was right about the Magic Leap One, and made it better, igniting a nasty lawsuit that only went away when Magic Leap suffered major setbacks, layoffs, reorganization, a new CEO, and renewed focus on enterprise applications. Xreal offloaded batteries and compute onto the smartphone, rather than jamming these hard-to-miniaturize components in the wings of the glasses, greately reducing the price. The only problem was the Nreal Light and its Nebula spatial computing operating system was kind of janky. So much so that it often failed in company demos. Unsurprisingly, sales were disappointing.\nXreal founder and CEO, Chi Xu, with author, professor Charlie Fink.\nThen Chi did something bold. He seemingly jettisoned spatial computing. Instead, he renamed the company Xreal, and made projector glasses that merely mirrored the screen of the smartphone, which we call assisted, not augeneted reality. It is not augmented reality as it does not offer a composite view of the physical and digital, but imagines smart glasses as a mobile phone accessory, not the main event. Xreal sold 300,000 of its Air and Air2 glasses. It saved the company.\nThe stylish titainium rims ensures that style hides the frame\u2019s slightly too large look.\nBut Chi is not giving up on spatial computing. At CES, Xreal introduced the next generation of the Xreal Air 2 smart glasses, the Air2 Ultra (for now). The new device re-introduces spatial computing glasses, but it\u2019s based on the Air2, which keeps the cost down ($699). Tech writers have been going bonkers about it all week. While it is a remarkable low-cost, 6 DOF headset, it\u2019s tethered awkwardly to the smartphone. The company says there is no bluetooth solution to the power needs of the headset.\nAs if taking a victory lap, Xreal had a booth that dominated the XR area in the Central Hall at LVCC, and several diverse applications of its headset elsewhere at CES. The Air2 is also being used by Sightful in their monitorless Spacetop laptop, and a new initiative with BMW to imagine the impact of spatial computing on the passenger experience.\nThe in-car XR experience with the Nreal Air2 smart glasses, presented by the BMW Group at CES 2024.\nMy demo of the Xreal Air2 Ultra was flat out impressive (specs). There are screens and 3D objects all around you, mixed with reality, floating in your room. The 52-degree field of view bests all competitors. It still takes a little getting used to, but screens are anchored in place as they would in the physical world. The glasses weigh in at an impressive 80 grams. The addition of a three position temple adjustment and extra nose pieces ensure the right fit. The stylish titainium rims ensures that style hides the frame\u2019s slightly too large look.\nClick for part two of this story: AR Glasses at CES 2024 and AR Helping the Handicapped to See at CES 2024.

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch to see what's next in tech\nAfter 2023 gave us the most innovative year in tech in over a decade, the two trends that powered much of that innovation -- AI and VR/AR -- are poised to lead the way at CES 2024. And following a fall product launch season that was as intense as any we've ever seen in the tech ecosystem, CES 2024 is set to explode with a ton of announcements about real products that are coming in the months ahead.\nIn other words, you can expect to see a lot fewer of the CES experiments and flights-of-fancy of the past dominating the headlines this year, because there are so many interesting and useful new things to crowd them out.\nSpecial Feature\nCES 2024\nEach year, CES reveals new product trends that transform the future of work and life. ZDNET will sort through the wave of news and announcements to find the innovations that will matter most to professionals.\nZDNET has already been pre-briefed on many of the best products that are coming, and we're looking forward to sharing our first impressions, original photos and videos, and buying advice. Our team will be on the ground at CES as well as covering it broadly from multiple time zones. We'll highlight the products we're most excited about, the trends that are taking shape from the show, and the latest innovations most likely to shape the future.\nTo put it all in context, here are the three themes that will make the biggest impact at this year's CES.\n1. AI clouds everything\nAny product that includes an algorithm, machine learning, or automation of any kind is going to be marketed as an AI-powered product at CES 2024. Make no mistake, there will be plenty of AI-washing, as companies vie with each other to ride the generative AI wave. ZDNET will help you cut through the AI marketing cacophony to learn the best AI innovations coming to products in 2024. Fortunately, there are a ton of potential benefits to look forward to -- from products and features that will automatically translate audio and text from different languages to TV hardware that will improve upscaling of low-res content for today's amazing 4K and 8K displays to truly time-saving automations in the products you use every day.\n2. VR, AR, and XR prep for a big year\nThe metaverse may have been dud, but mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) are surging on a new wave of interest -- thanks in large part to Apple's Vision Pro announcement, which has put the spotlight on the next generation of immersive digital experiences. You can get an excellent taste of these today in the Meta Quest 3, ZDNET's 2023 product of the year. And CES 2024 will feature new hardware and experiences that will push it to the next level. We're expecting announcements about headsets that will use Qualcomm's new XR2+ Gen2 VR chip, new sensors and software that will extend what today's headsets and experiences can do, and the latest updates on how all kinds of organizations -- from health care to astronauts to law enforcement to architects to product designers -- are now relying on VR and XR to do critical parts of their work every day. Of course, all of this is a prelude to the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, the arrival of the Samsung/Google XR headset, and a tidal wave of new experiences from developers who will take advantage of these immersive digital platforms.\n3. 100-inch TVs lead a wave of innovation\nTVs are back at the center of innovation at this year's show -- and leaps forward in display technology are making an even bigger and broader impact across the tech industry. From OLED to Mini-LED to Laser TV (projectors), there's a new explosion of innovation and competition that's making content more exciting than ever to consume. Nothing says CES like 100-inch TVs, and we're going to see a lot of them at CES 2024. A new generation of 100-inch TVs is coming to market that won't break the bank or your back. We can't wait to show you the latest TVs and home entertainment products that are coming and we'll offer analysis and buying advice on which ones could transform and level up\u00a0the way you experience content in 2024.\nStay tuned to ZDNET to cut through the fluff and find the stuff that's worth your attention at CES 2024.\nRelated\nThe 5 biggest headphones trends that you'll be hearing more about in 2024\n2024 in tech: The true winners next year will be the companies that do this\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?"

Pre-orders are available at\u00a0OculenzAMD.com.\nAbout Advanced Macular DegenerationAdvanced Macular degeneration (AMD) is\u00a0the leading cause of vision loss among adults over 65\u00a0and impacts\u00a020 million Americans. Worldwide,\u00a0nearly 200 million individuals\u00a0suffer from some form of AMD. This progressive disease advances through three stages: the early stage, typically symptom-free; the intermediate stage, possibly marked by mild blurriness in central vision or difficulty seeing in low light; and the advanced stage, characterized by disrupted central vision and reduced visual acuity. The advanced stage is sub-typed into neovascular (wet) AMD or geographic atrophy (GA). Stargardts is the juvenile form of AMD, which can strike patients as young as ten years old. While there are approved FDA treatments for these conditions, there are currently no therapies that can restore vision once lost. Assistive technologies like OcuLenz can aid those in advanced AMD, helping to maximize remaining vision.\nAbout OcutrxOcutrx Technologies, Inc., anchored in the US and Europe, leads in AR/XR and 3D visualization, expanding its horizons across various industries.

Reviews ethics statement\nCES 2024 Health Tech: The Things That May Actually Improve Your Wellness\nFrom improvements in diabetes care to glasses that help you hear, here are the highlights from the world's largest consumer electronics show.\nThese Nuance Audio glasses look like a regular pair, but they're built to help you hear better.\nNew health and wellness technology can be an attractive sell because, well, who doesn't want to feel better? At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Here Are Some of the Highlights of the Consumer Tech Show\nCES 2024, one of the biggest tech events in the world, was a star-studded event featuring innovative technology everywhere you looked. From unfolding laptops to retro phone keyboards, there were creative devices, both big and small on display. Some of the technology on display at the Consumer tech show was released immediately for purchase while others presented concept ideas that were gearing up for a launch later this year, but the one thing they all had in common was a clear vision for the future of technology. We\u2019ve already discussed some of the earlier announcements, such as the Sony XR headset and the Samsung Music Frame, but those were just the tip of the iceberg at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nA Quick Review of Some of the Most Fascinating Tech at CES 2024\nThere were an unbelievable number of products announced and presented at the Consumer Electronics 2024 Show and keeping track of all of them is not an easy task. The range of products was staggering, and while XR/AR technology has been dominating the event, we\u2019re also quite surprised at the number of home gadgets that have made an impact during the event. While Apple made its Apple Vision Pro launch announcement and temporarily distracted us from the event, we\u2019re back on track to go over some of the most interesting products that were showcased at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event.\nWacom Cintiq Pro Tablets Announced at CES Las Vegas 2024\nWhen it comes to tech that improves your work, the Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets are a true designer\u2019s dream. The Cintiq Pro 17, 22, and 27 refer to different sized versions that are available to ensure comfort for everyone, and with their Pantone Validated and Pantone SkinTone Validated displays, they guarantee a color palette that matches up to their real-world counterparts. With a slim bezel and a large screen, the drawing tool promises a 120 Hz 4K display with a 10-point multi-touch feature that gives you the control you need to interact with your projects as you work.\nThe additional announcement of the Wacom Pro Pen 3 as well as the Cintiq Pro Stand, one that is sold separately, guarantees a fully customized experience for users who want to adapt the device to suit them instead of the other way around.\nLG Signature OLED T\u2014The World\u2019s First Transparent TV\nIt\u2019s interesting that even one company decided to bring out transparent screen technology this year but two companies with a similar idea signal the possibility of a new trend. The transparent TV has been much talked about at the CES 2024 event and while Samsung also released its own MicroLED transparent screen it wasn\u2019t as evidently a \u201cTV\u201d release as the LG edition of the product was. With a new Alpha 11 AI processor built-in, the 77-inch OLED TV comes set in the Zero Connect Box that allows you to place your TV anywhere in the room, no longer confining the device to a wall or a corner of the room.\nThe LG Signature OLED T, the world\u2019s first 4k wireless, transparent, OLED TV unveiled at #CES2024\nVideo Credit: @LGUS pic.twitter.com/J9vzu8QpAW\n\u2014 Wevolver (@WevolverApp) January 10, 2024\nModular versions of the TV allow you to pick the wall-mounted set-up as well if you still like the traditional setting. Eliminating the gaping black hole created by a generic TV, the LG Signature OLED T allows you to refine your home aesthetic to suit your tastes without compromising on your viewing experience when you do decide to use it for the purpose it was designed.\nMSI\u2019s Claw Handheld\nGamers have not been ignored this time at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 event either. The Asus ROG Phone 8 catered to the world of mobile gaming while MSI\u2019s Claw handheld console. With Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake chip built into it, the deceive sets itself apart from the others on the market currently still powered by the AMD chipset. This detail, just by itself, makes the device stand out among other gaming consoles you could consider investing in this year. Promising 500 nits brightness, the 7-inch screen showcases a 1920\u00d71080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate and runs on the Intel Arc Graphics card.\nThe Valve Steam Deck remains the most affordable and popular option, all things considered, but joining the ranks of the Lenovo Legion Go or the Asus ROG Ally consoles is no easy task. And yet MSI\u2019s Claw console seems quite equipped to make a mark in the market.\nRabbit R1 Pin\u2014Creating the Simplest Computer\nThe new gadget looks just as adorable as it sounds, but its multipurpose functionality intends to join the race to replace smartphones, a challenge that we didn\u2019t know we needed to take on. The mini device aims to replace the multiple apps you have on your phone and handle tasks by itself instead, promising to book your flights and order your groceries for you. By talking to the rabbits on the device, you can assign tasks that will be taken care of for you. You can also type out the questions by shaking the device for a keyboard.\n@jessechenglyu rationale for creating Rabbit OS and their own device instead of just another app is persuasive. It resonates with Alan Kay\u2019s insight: \u2018People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\u2019 I\u2019m quite convinced getting a Rabbit R1 as my next\u2026 https://t.co/QTGcPjEJHO\n\u2014 Jaeyun Ha (@jaeyun_ha) January 12, 2024\nUnlike traditional chatbots that only understand your intention, the Rabbit R1 pin will also learn how to respond and execute them. Once you pre-authenticate the apps on the Rabbit interface on your regular computer, your Rabbit R1 device navigates through your apps based on your instructions. Now we aren\u2019t willing to let go of our phones just yet, but we\u2019re quite fascinated to see the device grow, and we\u2019re not the only ones. The first two batches of the Rabbit R1 device, each one 10,000 strong have officially sold out within days of its launch. The third batch is now open for pre-order, with an expected delivery date around May-June 2024.\nHelio Ring Debut at CES 2024\nWearable technology is definitely having its moment and the gadgets celebrated at the Consumer Tech show were no different. Amazefit\u2019s Helio Ring tracks health data just like a smartwatch would, without being as clunky or obvious with its presence. The device works like a sleep tracker but also monitors your activity on the go, reflecting all your data on the Zepp App for you to peruse when you need it. Its electrodermal activity sensors can measure your skin and sweat responses to reflect on why you might be stressed, which is interesting to the more familiar heart rate and blood-oxygen saturation trackers. The compact device is lightweight and can apparently be custom engraved with a date or phrase as well.\nSay hello to the Amazfit Helio Ring \ud83d\ude4c Engineered for elite athletes who know that quality recovery fuels peak performance, this #smartring represents a whole new level of #BreakingLimits \ud83d\udd25 Ready to recover smarter & achieve more? Check out the comments for more info \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/llgCeqKYoR\n\u2014 Amazfit (@AmazfitGlobal) January 9, 2024\nAnother honorable mention for wearable tech at the CES Las Vegas 2024 event includes the XREAL Air 2 Ultra smart glasses, which are \u201ca brand new spatial computing platform designed specifically for AR developer partners.\u201d These titanium AR glasses are going to be a much more affordable alternative for people wanting to explore the AR technology available today.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nIf your phone screens can handle being foldable why not fold your laptop screens as well? The new Asus series at CES 2024 includes the Asus Zenbook Duo which has us quite fascinated but we\u2019re equally captivated by the ZenScreen Fold OLED display. For those who require multiple monitors for their work, taking their tasks around with them becomes quite difficult. The Asus ZenScreen Fold OLED does not compromise on its display quality but also ensures that you have a portable work solution that you can set up wherever you need.\nASUS Foldable external OLED display #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/SRQtGql9UU\n\u2014 Tomi (@GadgetsBoy) January 9, 2024\nWhether in portrait or landscape mode, the screen shows no signs of interruption despite the hinge in the middle. The 17.3-inch display offers 2560\u00d71920 resolution and covers 100 percent of the cinema-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. It also has an audio jack if you choose to use the device as a screen for your gaming adventures. Samsung\u2019s Flex In and Out phone also deserves special mention for the advanced foldable tech it brought to the event among its other offerings making it evident that foldable tech might just be the way forward.\nOverall, it appears the CES Las Vegas 2024 was a big success and introduced a vast range of technology that sets the bar high for the rest of the releases this year. It\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll hear about the Consumer tech show as a lot of the products that were announced are scheduled for a release later this year. Once those begin to arrive on the market, we\u2019ll be able to see how they hold up to these initial reviews.\nFAQs\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

        "raw_content": "RESEARCH NOTE: Qualcomm Enables 4K+ Per-Eye XR With XR2+ Gen 2 Platform at CES 2024\nCES 2024 is poised to be the show where the entire XR ecosystem preps its product launches ahead of the imminent launch of the Apple Vision Pro headset. As everyone anticipates the Vision Pro and its high-resolution displays, Qualcomm is poised to enable the whole ecosystem to compete with Apple using its latest XR platforms. It may feel like Qualcomm just announced its XR2 Gen 2 platform, and in fact that happened only in October. Now, however, Qualcomm is introducing yet another XR platform in rapid succession to its XR2 Gen 2 and AR1 Gen 1 products launched last year.\nSnapdragon XR2+ Gen 2\nQualcomm is pressing ahead on performance with the XR2+ Gen 2, which is a meaningful step up from the XR2 Gen 2 platform already out in the wild in Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. The XR2 Gen 2 was already a considerable performance improvement over the XR2 Gen 1, with 2.5X better GPU performance and 8X better AI performance, along with support for 3K x 3K per-eye displays. The XR2+ Gen 2 takes things further by introducing support for 4.3K x 4.3K per-eye displays. This very much feels like Qualcomm and Meta are painting a target on Apple\u2019s back, because it is the same resolution of the displays announced for the Apple Vision Pro. The Vision Pro has 23 million pixels across both displays, which equates to about 3.4K x 3.4K per eye, surpassing the XR2 Gen 2 but falling short of the XR2+ Gen 2.\nThere\u2019s an interesting wrinkle here. Suppose you enabled exactly 4.3K x 4.3K per eye. In that case, you would end up with roughly an 8K resolution display, which is incredibly difficult to power with a mobile chipset. That\u2019s why Qualcomm had to increase GPU clocks by 15% and CPU clocks by 20% in the new product. While increased resolutions are generally more GPU-bound than CPU-bound, if your CPU is underpowered, you might end up bottlenecking the GPU\u2019s performance\u2014which Qualcomm has avoided here.\nQualcomm also says that it can support the new higher resolution at 90 FPS. This implies that foveated rendering will become a must for devices using such high-resolution displays, because foveated rendering only renders the area a person\u2019s eyeball is focused on rather than the whole screen. (It renders everything outside of the focal area at a lower resolution.) Apple and Sony are already using foveated rendering in their headsets, and the whole industry will have to move in that direction to maximize comfort, image quality, battery life, and performance. This is a topic I\u2019ve talked about in detail in a 2018 paper about foveated rendering that I wrote in collaboration with eye-tracking leader Tobii.\nQualcomm also increased the camera support to 12+ cameras per device, up from 10 in the XR2 Gen 2, which itself increased from seven in the original XR2 Gen 1. Some of those cameras include user-facing cameras for eye-tracking, which are necessary to enable the foveated rendering capabilities that I expect will be necessary for 4K x 4K per-eye resolution. Qualcomm has long worked with Tobii, a leader in the eye-tracking space for both commercial and consumer applications, and the supplier for the Sony PlayStation VR2 headset\u2019s eye-tracking system. That partnership continues to deepen between the two companies; it has complemented Qualcomm\u2019s work with headset ODM Goertek to create an eye-tracking-enabled reference headset for OEMs to bring products to market more quickly.\nQualcomm says that it already has more than five OEMs in development with the current XR2+ Gen 2, and there\u2019s a chance we could see some of them announced as early as CES. We already know that one of those OEMs is Samsung, which announced its partnership with Qualcomm and Google almost a year ago at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2023.\nGoogle and Samsung\nBoth Samsung and Google are quoted in Qualcomm\u2019s release about the new XR2+ Gen 2 platform for XR headsets, which means that whatever new MR/VR headset Samsung and Google will put out will almost certainly ship with an XR2+ Gen 2. This also gives us a clearer idea about the performance and high resolution that we could expect from Samsung\u2019s XR headset.\nSamsung is a very close partner of Qualcomm\u2019s, especially since Samsung went 100% Snapdragon in 2023 for its flagship devices. While that arrangement could change this year, Samsung remains firmly aligned with Qualcomm. It also seems to be strengthening its relationship with Google as all three companies look for a way to challenge Apple\u2019s impending Vision Pro launch. I believe that whatever Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm create should cost a fraction of what Apple\u2019s headset will cost, and that\u2019s already a positive development.\nWrapping up\nWhile the XR2+ Gen 2 is a considerable improvement on the XR2 Gen 2, it is pretty clear that this launch needs to be seen in the context of what is happening more broadly within the industry. The XR2+ Gen 2 will be at the core of what Samsung and Google use to compete with Apple in XR.\nIn this context, it\u2019s essential to remember that Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is a two-chip solution: the M2 will handle CPU and GPU processing workloads, while the R1 will handle all the cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The R1\u2019s camera latency is 12ms, the same as Qualcomm\u2019s XR2+ Gen 2, which produces passthrough video for mixed reality. Qualcomm\u2019s XR2 series combines these capabilities into a single chip in the form of the XR2+ Gen 2, matching or surpassing many Apple M2 + R1 capabilities.\nI believe that Samsung and Google are happy that Qualcomm has a chipset ready as a complete SoC. Even better, this SoC is specialized for XR applications and already proven across multiple generations to have flagship-tier performance levels for an XR device. Things are heating up in the XR space, and we\u2019re only in the first week of January. I expect things will only get more interesting in XR throughout 2024.\nAnshel Sag is Moor Insights & Strategy\u2019s in-house millennial with over 15 years of experience in the IT industry.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.
