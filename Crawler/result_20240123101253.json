Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nThe annual Consumer Technology Show rolled into the Las Vegas Convention Center last week. These are what we think are the most interesting pieces of tech coming from the event.\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting. Users can store around 1,700 photos or one hour of video in full quality, which you can then download to smartphones or devices.\nThe high-tech binoculars will be unsurprisingly expensive,\u00a0costing $4,799 when they are released in\u00a0February.\nRelated: Best binoculars for wildlife spotting 2024\nThe HRM-Fit sports bra heart rate monitor\nGarmin announced a new $149.99 heart rate monitor at CES called the HRM-Fit. It's designed for people to attach to sports bras from a wide range of manufacturers, including Adidas and Athleta. It can capture training data like ground contact time balance and stride length, as well as real-time heart rate, without compromising movement or performance.\nThe device then transmits this information to other fitness devices like Garmin smartwatches or Edge cycling computers, as well as compatible fitness apps like Tacx Training.\nUsers will need a compatible Garmin device to get the most out of the HRM-Fit, but even without one, the HRM-Fit can capture information on steps, calories burned, intensity minutes and all-day heart rate.\nRelated: Best fitness trackers 2024\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nOrla is an NCTJ-trained journalist with a background in beauty, lifestyle and technology commerce journalism and has worked for leading titles such as The Mirror and MailOnline.

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful.

They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here.

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

The show is produced by the Consumer Technology Association which is based in Arlington, Virginia. CES presents the latest technology offerings from companies across the world.\nHere is a look at some top products presented at CES 2024.\nTransparent televisions\nElectronics manufacturers LG and Samsung brought televisions to CES that have a transparent screen design. The TVs use OLED technology. They are designed to be hidden in a room when not in use.\nDavid Park, from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division, described OLED to the Associated Press (AP) as a \u201cmaterial that we can print on any type of surface.\u201d In this case, Park said OLED was printed onto a piece of glass.\nWhen not in the transparent setting, the TVs have a traditional, black background. The companies presenting the TVs did not provide pricing information, but experts say the transparent models are likely to cost tens of thousands of dollars.\nAI for Hyundai and Kia vehicles\nSouth Korea\u2019s Samsung announced it was cooperating with automaker Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services for all Hyundai and Kia vehicles.\nThis artificial intelligence (AI)-powered system will permit users of Samsung's SmartThings service to remotely set their vehicle\u2019s temperature or open its windows. And users can control lights and connect to devices inside the home when inside the car.\nCar parking robot\nSouth Korean electric automotive company HL Mando demonstrated a parking robot called Parkie. It is designed to operate independently in parking structures. The robot can move underneath parked vehicles, lift the cars up and transport them to different spaces or return them to their drivers.\nRobot pet sitter\nRobotics developer Ogmen presented a new machine designed to assist pets. The ORo robot is equipped with a food container to feed animals. It can also play with pets, record health details and capture images and video of animals\u2019 daily activities.\nBody power to charge a phone\nSports equipment developer LifeSpan introduced an exercise bicycle/desk combination that uses human power to charge phones or other devices. The Ampera bike is designed to be used with a \u201cstanding\u201d desk table. LifeSpan says at a speed of 60 rpms, the bike can produce up to 65 watts of electricity per hour.\nStreaming from vinyl\nRecord player manufacturer Victrola presented a new turntable model that can send, or stream, music to a sound system or personal device. The Sapphire player targets music lovers who favor vinyl over digital sound. It sells for about $1,500 and will go on sale in the spring.\nAdd walking power\nSouth Korea\u2019s WIRobotics introduced a wearable robot that provides walking assistance to users. The company\u2019s WIM model is designed for anyone who feels the need for an extra \u201cpush\u201d when walking. An online description explains the robot can help individuals \u201cwalk farther, faster and healthier.\u201d The price for such assistance is high, though, with the WIM selling for about $2,500.\n\u2018Smart\u2019 mirror for better mental health\nFrench health product developer Baracoda presented what it described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness.\u201d The company\u2019s BMind model is built to work in any bathroom and does not need a device app to operate.\nThe product was designed to use cameras and sensors to collect data on a person\u2019s movements, expressions and language. Creators of the device claim it can identify a user\u2019s moods and sense other possible mental health issues. The electronic mirror can then suggest different treatments or activities to help the user, or even guide forms of meditation.\nHomemade ice cream in 2 minutes\nThe ColdSnap company introduced a machine that can make single servings of ice cream in about two minutes. The machine uses small containers, called pods, just like Keurig coffeemakers. The company points out the pods for its ColdSnap machine can be kept at room temperature, saving energy costs. The machines can be taken anywhere and are simple to operate.\nRobotic lawnmower\nChinese robotics developer Mammotion demonstrated a new version of its self-driving lawnmower. The latest, all-wheel-drive Luba 2 includes new wireless abilities and tools to deal with obstacles in the grass. The robot mower is already available and sells for just over $2,000.\nI\u2019m Bryan Lynn.\nBryan Lynn wrote this story for VOA Learning English, based on reports from The Associated Press, Reuters and other online sources.\nQuiz - Top Technology Products at CES 2024\n______________________________________\nWords in This Story\ntransparent \u2013 adj. clear and easy to understand or recognize\nprint \u2013 v. to produce writing or images on paper or other material with a machine\nremote \u2013 adj. from a distance or far away\nvinyl \u2013 n. a kind of very strong plastic that is used to produce records\nmirror \u2013 n. a piece of glass with a shiny metallic material on one side that produces an image of anything that is in front of it\nmood \u2013 n. the way someone feels at a particular time\nmeditation \u2013 n. to think calming thoughts for a long period of time in order to relax or improve spirituality\nlawnmower \u2013 n. a motorized machine used for cutting grass\nobstacle \u2013 n. something that blocks movement or makes it difficult\nForum\nRelated"

A potential game-changer for home entertainment, the entrance of the transparent LED displays using see-through glass can bring inanimate objects to life by becoming overlays. For example, users can project slideshows or moving clips, and these fresh takes on TVs can double as active home furnishings.\nIn fact, LG seems to have this in mind when they introduced LG Signature OLED TV, a revamped sibling of the brand\u2019s first OLED TV in 2013, a rollable OLED TV in 2019, and a wireless OLED TV just in 2023. While it is not rollable, the brand combines the features of its predecessors into a single see-through glass display with LG Signature OLED TV. It uses wireless AV transmission and reception technology to eliminate all kinds of wires other than the power source around the transparent screen, making it a candidate for the world\u2019s first wireless transparent LED display for homes, offices, and other private and commercial spaces.\nimages courtesy of LG (unless stated)\nLG Signature OLED TV with two display modes\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED display and TV make it an ideal appliance to be freely installed anywhere at home, be it in front of the living room window or even inside the kitchen. Users may not need to worry about the daylight infiltrating the screen and making it difficult to see what is projected since the LG Signature OLED TV comes in two modes. The first is called Transparency Mode, which gives the TV a 3D, hologram effect. For example, when the users want to pull up a moving screensaver, such as blooming flowers or fish swimming in the ocean, the space behind the screen and the content overlap, making the visuals appear as if they were right in the space of viewing.\nThe Black Screen Mode might suit everyday TV use since it darkens the transparent OLED display, so users can enjoy watching movies or playing games. LG\u2019s Signature OLED TV comes with 4K resolution packed in a 77-inch display and an Alpha 11 Processor, which is an engine equipped with enhanced AI performance to improve the projected graphics performance by up to 70 percent, as LG claims. It also has an OLED T-bar mode which displays the date, weather, major news, and others in the form of a bar at the bottom of the transparent screen, so the users are always on the pulse of current events. LG says that its transparent LED display, which is present at CES 2024, is scheduled to be released in global markets, including Korea, within the year.\nLG\u2019s Signature OLED TV unveiled at CES 2024\nSamsung debuts its transparent MICRO LED display\nSamsung has also debuted its new transparent MICRO LED display that can animate motionless surroundings and objects. Visitors to CES 2024 can witness firsthand how the see-through glass functions, and Samsung is yet to release the full specifications of its new smart device. It can bring up memories of science fiction movies where they navigate the spaceships with the help of the hologram-like display in front of them. It is happening now with the arrival of Samsung\u2019s MICRO LED display since two people can stand on each side of the screen and still see each other as images, movies, or slideshows play on the glass.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent LED display at CES 2024 appears to have no edge or linings, making it easier to place it in any setting or location. The electronics company has not yet announced the commercialization of its display, but given its crystal-clear and glass-like display combined with the MICRO LED technology, users may need to ready their pockets or credit cards for their purchase. It might all be worth it since they can play with Samsung\u2019s transparent LED display around to suit their viewing lifestyle and position it almost anywhere they want since the projected imagery on the glass can remain viewable.\nLG\u2019s transaprent LED TV shows what\u2019s behind the screen\nLG\u2019s transparent LED display at CES 2024\nfirst look at Samsung\u2019s new transparent MICRO LED display at CES 2024\nimages appear to hover in real life\nproject info:\nname: LG Signature OLED TV, Samsung MICRO LED Display\ncompanies: LG, Samsung\nevent: CES 2024\nCES 2024 (3)\nLED (118)\nLG (36)\nSAMSUNG (98)\nPRODUCT LIBRARY\na diverse digital database that acts as a valuable guide in gaining insight and information about a product directly from the manufacturer, and serves as a rich reference point in developing a project or scheme.\ndesignboom will always be there for you"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: GE's Latest Smart Lights Will Spruce Up Your Kitchen Cabinets\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form.\nGE Lighting has a slew of new smart products to show off at CES, including an expanded Matter-capable lineup. But the most eye-catching products go in your kitchen: undercabinet and under-counter smart lights.\nUndercabinet and under-counter lights aren't new, of course, but usually, you're limited to motion sensor-activated white lighting. Savant, the parent company behind GE Lighting, is revealing what it calls a \"first in the North America market\" for undercabinet lighting: full-color support.\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights are \"HD+ Full Color\" and come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form. You can hardwire the lights into your home or use a plug if you have one in a convenient spot.\nThe lights are diffused, and Savant claims they are easy to install with captive screws, but this is a DIY product, so be prepared to put in some elbow grease. The lights also work with either the GE Sync app or Savant's app for its custom smart homes. You can also control them with Google Assistant or Alexa, and they're Matter-capable.\nPricing \"starts\" at $59.99, though it wasn't immediately clear if that's the puck pricing or if the edge-lit fixtures will come in multiple sizes. You can purchase Cync Reveal at Lowes, Target, and Amazon later this year.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nSavant also pledged to expand its lineup of Matter-enabled products to 20 in 2024. That includes the Cync Direct Connect Full Color Smart Bulb, Cync Smart Indoor Plug, the Direct Connect Full Color and Reveal line of bulbs and wafers, the Cync Outdoor Smart Plug, and the Cync Smart Thermostat.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "Pocketnow\nThe Best of CES 2024: Our favorite gadgets from the show\nFor another year running, CES didn't disappoint with its impressive tech lineup. Here's what we think were the best showings on the show floor\nCES 2024 kicked off the calendar year with an impressive collection of tech products. Be it updates to devices from the past year or all-new hardware, there was much to experience and learn about on and off the show floor.\nWe've combed through the show's numerous announcements to find you the very best products that you should look forward to later this year. So without further ado, here are out picks for the Best of CES 2024.\nHisense 110UX ULED TV\nTo start our list, we have the Hisense 110UX ULED TV that uses Mini LED technology. This display \u2014 also a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree \u2014 is an engineering feat that we find astonishing. It boasts a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and features 40,000 local dimming zones, meaning a visual experience setting a high bar for display performance. The TV is also bound to impress with color reproduction, covering 95% of the BT.2020 color palette.\nLooking past some of this hardware info, the Hisense 110UX also implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset that powers the Hi-View Engine X, which helps with image upscaling. The TV even supports Dolby Atmos Flex Connect to let you create the best listening experience for your watch parties.\nASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro\nWhen it comes to gaming phones, the ROG Phone series has been a stalwart. And for 2024, ASUS is bringing the ROG Phone 8 Pro with refinements that make it more suitable for day-to-day use, all while retaining many of its gaming aspects.\nThe ROG Phone 8 will ship in Q1 2024 \u2014 retailing for $1200 \u2014 and brings a 6.78-inch FHD+ LTPO AMOLED display that can refresh at 165Hz. It's also protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2. And powering the phone is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor \u2014 supported by a 5,500 mAh cell \u2014 the flagship chipset from Qualcomm that's taken the fight to Apple's mobile silicon dominance.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nNailing the 2-in-1 form factor is something we've seen many companies struggle with, and while Lenovo has its Yoga series, which offers some of the best hardware and a bang for the buck experience, it's not willing to stop.\nAt CES, Lenovo showed off the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid, and this device is taking the 2-in-1 term a little too word-for-word, giving users access to a device that runs both Android and Windows.\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus is a Windows laptop powered by Intel's Core Ultra processors when connected to its keyboard. And, when disconnected from the keyboard, it becomes an Android tablet powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.\nIt's an adaptable device that we can't wait to experience when it enters production and becomes available in the market for $2000 in Q2 2024.\nCASETiFY\nAt CES 2024, CASETiFY took to the stage to announce a comprehensive lineup of cases for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S24 series that's expected to launch at the Galaxy Unpacked event on January 17. These accessories come with a unique array of finishes and also offer features that aim to add convenience.\nCASETiFY is also introducing the Snappy Magnetic Ring, which brings the ability to use magnetic accessories with devices that don't have the necessary hardware. The most notable of its upcoming product lineup is the Impact Ring Stand Case, which can withstand 2-meter drops \u2014 due to the EcoShock absorbing technology.\nRabbit R1\nNext up, we have the Rabbit R1. This is a compact computing device that aims to harness the power of Large Action Models, in addition to the LLMs that we've grown accustomed to in the past year, to make life more seamless for users.\nRetailing for $199, this pocket device markets itself as a tool that will learn and interact with websites and other built-out workflows to accomplish tasks for users. It's simple: ask for what you want, and the device will jump through the traditional app-based workflow for you, delivering the end result. While it doesn't accomplish anything you can't already do with a few taps on your iPhone, the seamless scenario that Rabbit is marketing has us excited to see how it evolves, especially as the device is expected to make its way into the hands of users this year.\nASUS Zenbook Duo\nThe ASUS Zenbook Duo made its way to the CES show floor with a form factor that we saw in 2023, but its primary appeal is in the refinement it brings to the experience and also the top-of-the-line hardware.\nThe ASUS Zenbook Duo is the definition of eye candy with its sharp 14-inch 3K OLED displays. You can maximize productivity with these displays with the help of the detachable magnetic keyboard and the built-in kickstand.\nThe device is expected to start at $1500, and if you choose to upgrade, you can choose to deck it out with the Intel Core Ultra 9 and 32GB of RAM.\nClicks\nIf you're someone who appreciates tactile feedback when typing away, the shift away from physical keyboards on smartphones may have been something you wish didn't happen. To provide some respite, CES 2024 brought with it the Clicks Keyboard Case for iPhone.\nThe product comes with a backlit keyboard that replicates the digital one on your iPhone and connects to it via the Lightning/USB-C port. Once connected, the keyboard on your iPhone will disappear, giving you access to a lot more screen real estate. If you're a power user who has been looking for a compact keyboard solution for working on the go (and not just texting, although that's fine, too), this is something to keep an eye out for!\nSamsung Odyssey G9\nTo help gamers deck out their setups this year, Samsung is introducing an updated version of the Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor. The screen comes fitted with a matte panel that's perfect for limiting light reflections on the OLED panel. It also comes with several of Samsung's smart features for monitors, with the most notable being the Multi-View mode that will allow you to track up to three different activities on the 49-inch curved screen at one time.\nTCL QM8\nThe TCL QM8 has belonged at the top of most television lists when it comes to finding a product that delivers excellent picture quality, and at CES 2024, the manufacturer took the wraps off another iteration where it improves upon last year's hardware. It still features Mini LED technology and is available in 4 different sizes. As for key specs, it boasts a peak brightness of 5,000 nits and has 20,000 dimming zones. For those interested in large screens, there's even a new 115-inch iteration in the QM family that's worth looking at!\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 PRO\nTCL's NXTPAPER technology has continued to improve year-on-year, and this year at CES 2024, the NXTPAPER-based product that took us by surprise is the NXTPAPER 14 Pro. This device implements the NXTPAPER technology in an interesting manner, as with the flip of a switch, you will be able to swap seamlessly between a stripped-down experience and one that displays a wide array of colors. Other appealing aspects of this tablet are the 2.8K resolution on the panel and the MediaTek Dimensity 8020 chip (with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage).\nLG Signature OLED T\nA head turner at CES 2024, the LG Signature OLED T is a device that brings the awe factor back into technology.\nBased on the concept showcased at CES 2023, the LG Signature OLED T features a transparent panel that you can see through or display content upon. While it's still unclear how much the device will retail for, if you're looking for something truly new, it doesn't get better than this.\nAnd if you're wondering about actual usability, there's a contrast film to ensure you're able to enjoy your TV for what it is. But when you're in transparent mode, there are quite a few software changes that will help increase immersion. It's surely a unique product and one that's interesting to see making its way to production rather than remaining as vaporware.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra\nLast on the list is the Xreal Air 2 Ultra; this new set of glasses offers another option for users who are interested in the mixed reality-based future. It features a lightweight titanium frame and is compatible with a vast range of devices.\nIt also further builds upon the Xreal Air 2, featuring two 3D cameras on its front to help capture the environment around you and then project information on it. As for the displays within the glasses, they are micro OLED panels from Sony with a 1920x1080 resolution per eye.\nFor $699, the Xreal Air 2 sets itself up for success as it undercuts the Meta Quest Pro and the Apple Vision Pro; we will keep a keen eye on this product and how it develops throughout the year.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nAs an Editor at Pocketnow, Aryan covers all things mobile, be it the latest smartphones, wearables, gaming consoles, or accessories.\nHis experience using some of the newest hardware from Apple, Google, Samsung (and many others) on the market will come in handy if you're trying to understand the devices you use better or need help making the right purchase decision.\nDeals\nBuyer's Guides\nTrending Now"

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nIn the world of smart lighting and smart home technology, CES is a big affair, acting as our first preview of what\u2019s to come in the following year. This year, CES 2024 is happening right now in Las Vegas, Nevada, and it\u2019s off to an exciting start with a strong showing of debut smart lighting.\nAs always, our team of editors is on the ground at CES, getting a first glimpse of offerings like GE Lighting\u2019s under-cabinet fixtures, the new edition of the Neon Rope Light, and new Matter compatible lights from Nanoleaf.\nCES 2024: The best new smart lighting and smart light bulbs\nGovee Neon Rope Light 2\nShape your light, and your lighting.\nThe Neon Rope Light 2 reimagines a preexisting Govee product, the Neon Rope Light. We reviewed the previous model and appreciated its intuitive, customizable design and smart features.\nAs with the previous model, the Rope Light 2 is capable of displaying millions of colors. But it also improves on the original design with smoother effects, a better flexing material, and new app features in the Govee Home App. This includes shape recognition through your device's camera.\nWe\u2019re excited to try the Neon Rope Light 2 and see if its new features truly bring it to the next level.\nWhile Govee doesn't give an exact date for the release of the Neon Rope Light 2, it should be available soon.\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nSync your smart lights with the media you love.\nWhat if you could sync smart lighting and entertainment through one hub? The Govee AI Sync Box Kit 2 is built for just this, using AI to recognize and augment moments in your gaming and home entertainment with the help of smart lights like the Govee Glide Hexa Light Panels.\nThe hub connects video and lighting signals, and can match lighting schemes to 4K 120Hz gameplay. It's supported by Govee Home, Google, and Alexa, with plans to include Matter later this year.\nThe AI Sync Box Kit 2 will be available in the first half of 2024.\nEnroll in Home Ec.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\nGE Cync Reveal HD+ Full Color Undercabinet Fixtures\nFill the nooks and crannies with illumination.\nFull color built-in lighting that\u2019s made for permanent installation in your cabinet, the new GE Cync Reveal HD+ fixtures extend what smart lighting can do, giving you deeper control of the nuances of your home\u2019s mood and feel.\nThese full color lights are able to display millions of color combinations, including a wide range of whites, as well as dim to ultra-low contrast levels of 1% brightness.\nUp to ten smart lights can be connected, and full control is available through the Cync app, Alexa, Google, Matter, or the Savant professional app (GE Cync\u2019s proprietary control app). These cabinet lights should play well with other GE Cync lights you might already own, such as the GE Cync Dynamic Effects Smart Hexagon Panels.\nThe permanent or semi-permanent fixtures can be installed via plug or hardwire. They will be available later on in 2024 at Lowes,\nTarget, and Amazon for approximately $60.\nU-tec Bright Wi-Fi Mesh Smart Lighting Bulb Without Hub\nMake any lamp into a smart light.\nA bulb with excellent control, the U-tec Bright Wi-Fi Mesh Smart Lighting Bulb supplies bright color modulating light and Wi-Fi mesh connectivity without requiring a hub.\nThis mesh connectivity means that only one bulb connects to your wifi\u2014all other bulbs connect to that first bulb. This causes less strain on your Wi-Fi router, allowing you to connect more bulbs while sustaining a stable connection.\nApp controls give you synchronization with other smart home technology, color customization, and scheduling.\nTrue to its name, this smart light bulb is also bright, delivering 1,100 lumens, which is better than the standard 800 delivered by classic 60-watt bulbs.\nWe like U-Tec\u2019s smart locks, and we\u2019re excited to see how fleets of these bulbs perform when synchronized across a home.\nThe U-tec Bright Wi-Fi Mesh Smart Lighting Bulb will be available in 2024.\nNanoleaf Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor)\nPlay out Nanoleaf's prebuilt color patterns or design your own.\nWhether the den of a frequent entertainer or of a cozy-focused homebody, every home interior will benefit from smart lighting.

Why you can trust us.\nTechlicious Top Picks of CES 2024 Awards\nby Techlicious on January 11, 2024\nCES never fails to surprise and amaze with its annual showcase of breakthroughs. Amidst the thousands of new products, certain innovations shine brighter. An exceptional design, cutting-edge features, or the sheer novelty of the technology can make it a coveted item that grabs our attention and sparks the desire, 'Ooh, I want that!'\"\nThis year, we crowned a select group of products with our Techlicious Top Picks of CES 2024 Award. We love them, and we think you will, too.\nElizabeth Harper, Suzanne Kantra, Josh Kirschner, Andrea Smith, John R. Quain, and Stewart Wolpin contributed to this story.\nCelestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory\nExploring the wonders of the night sky is a dream for many, but it can demand extensive astronomical knowledge and a lot of patience. Enter the Celestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory, a game-changer in amateur astronomy. The new telescope can process data faster, thanks in part to AI, and can deliver crystal-clear images in just seconds, not minutes or hours. You can even schedule the Origin to take stunning pictures of space objects you'd otherwise miss while you're asleep.\nThe Origin uses a Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA) design that positions a Sony STARVIS image sensor at the front of a 6-inch telescope tube, creating a rapid f/2.2 system with an impressively broad field of view. AI technology processes the images to minimize noise, highlight fine details, and enhance contrast, all without manual intervention. This combination of hardware and software makes deep-sky astrophotography accessible to astronomy enthusiasts regardless of their skill level.\nThe Celestron Origin Intelligent Home Observatory, priced at $3,999, is not just a telescope; it's a gateway to the stars. Available for now for pre-order on B&HPhoto and Adorama for $3,999.\nClicks Creator Keyboard\nIf you miss the tactile sensation of typing on a physical keyboard, the Clicks Creator Keyboard for iPhone is a game-changer. It's not just a throwback to the BlackBerry days; it's a modern update that combines the best of both worlds. The keyboard offers familiar shortcuts, enhancing your productivity. For instance, CMD + H quickly returns you to the home screen, while CMD + Space launches the search function.\nThe Clicks Creator Keyboard is integrated with the iPhone case, freeing up valuable screen space. This feature is particularly handy when typing lengthy emails or crafting social media posts. During our testing, the keyboard's tactile feedback stood out, as did the convenient backlight.\nThe Clicks Creator Keyboard is more than just a nostalgic novelty; it's a practical tool for enhancing your iPhone experience. Available for pre-order at $139 on Clicks.tech, it starts shipping on February 1, 2024.\nEssilorLuxottica Nuance Audio Glasses\nThe EssilorLuxottica Nuance Audio Glasses are a groundbreaking innovation for those with mild hearing loss who also wear glasses. These glasses do double duty: they not only correct your vision but also enhance your hearing in noisy environments, like bustling restaurants. This is a significant advantage over traditional earbuds or hearing aids.\nUnlike traditional earbuds or hearing aids, these glasses use beam-forming directional microphone technology to amplify sounds in a 20-degree range in front of you, aligning with your line of sight. Instead of an earbud or rest-in-canal (RIC) speaker hearing aid design, the glasses\u2019 frames have four tiny speakers built into the temples. The result? Clear audio without anything inserted into your ears.\nMoreover, the glasses boast a stylish design with thick horn-rimmed frames, allowing you to wear your hearing aids without drawing attention. EssilorLuxottica is currently awaiting OTC hearing aid certification for the Nuance Audio Glasses and expects availability later this year. Pricing details are yet to be announced.\nHisense 110UX Mini-LED 8K TV\nHisense's 110-inch 110UX Mini-LED 8K TV sets a new bar for big-screen TVs. Its staggering brightness, peaking at an unprecedented 10,000 nits, is double that of any other TV we've evaluated. This model also sets a new standard with 40,000 local dimming zones, and boasts an extraordinarily wide color gamut.\nHowever, superior specs alone don't make a great TV. The new AI processor skillfully utilizes the extra brightness to take advantage of HDR content and provides precise control over the numerous dimming zones. When we experienced the 100UX on the show floor, its performance was nothing less than spectacular.\nWith its size and outstanding features, it's clear the 100UX is a premium offering. But given Hisense's history for aggressive pricing, it will be interesting to see where it lands cost-wise when it hits the market later this year.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe term \"2-in-1 laptop\" is familiar in the realm of Windows laptops, denoting devices with detachable displays that double as tablets. Yet, Lenovo has advanced this concept remarkably with the 14-inch ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. This innovative device isn't just a Windows laptop; it's also an Android tablet.\nIn its clamshell form, the ThinkBook Plus offers the unique ability to switch seamlessly between Windows and Android operating systems with a simple toggle. Detaching the display transforms it into the \"Hybrid Tablet,\" an Android tablet compatible with the optional Lenovo Tab Pen, ideal for tasks like note-taking. The remaining keyboard unit, or \"Hybrid Station,\" containing the Windows OS and its chipset, can connect to a monitor, offering a full-fledged Windows PC experience.\nThis versatility makes it two distinct products in one innovative package. As a Windows 11 computer, the Hybrid Station is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and 32GB LPDDR5 RAM with a 1TB SSD. And as an Android 13 tablet, the Hybrid Tablet uses a Qualcomm Adreno processor and 12GB LPDDR5 RAM with a 256GB SSD.\nSet for release in Q2 2024, the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid redefines flexibility in computing, starting at an expected price of $1,999.\nLG SIGNATURE OLED T\nThere are times as tech journalists that a product triggers the joy and wonder that made us choose our profession. Viewing LG's SIGNATURE OLED T transparent TV was one of those moments.\nThe innovative transparent design of the OLED T offers unique placement options, such as in front of windows or as a creative room divider, a concept previously unthought of in TV design. The integration of LG\u2019s Zero Connect box, which wirelessly transmits audio and video, further enhances its sleek design by minimizing cable clutter. Though final configurations are still in the works, options will include stand-alone, against-the-wall, and wall-mount setups, with or without additional shelves.\nWhen watching content in transparent mode, images appear 3D and seem to float in the air. And with the press a button, a black screen rolls up behind the transparent display, giving you all the beautiful picture quality that you\u2019d expect from one of LG\u2019s high-end OLED TVs \u2013 a truly jaw-dropping experience.\nWhile pricing and availability details are yet to be confirmed, we anticipate the SIGNATURE OLED T to be very expensive and potentially hit the market by late 2024.\nLotus Ring\nTechnology doesn\u2019t have to be complicated to be incredibly useful, as the Lotus Ring demonstrates. For anyone with mobility issues, the Lotus Rings offers a simple way to turn lights on and off with no app, smart speaker, or AI chatbot required. Point your finger at the Lotus light switch, click the Ring, and it will send an infrared signal to turn on or off the light. Think \"The Clapper,\" but able to handle all the lights (and, eventually, other devices) in your home.\nSetting it up is a breeze. Simply attach the Lotus cover, which uses magnets, over just about any existing light switch.\nThe Lotus Ring is fully waterproof, so you can do the dishes and shower with it on. You can use the Ring with multiple light switches. Since it\u2019s infrared and requires a line of sight, there\u2019s no worry about interference or someone accidentally turning off the light from another room.\nYou can put a $4.99 pre-order deposit down now for Lotus Ring and three switches on GetLotus.\nOrCam Hear OTC hearing aids\nOrCam Hear OTC hearing aids redefine the experience of conversation in noisy environments. Unlike typical over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids that simply amplify all sounds, OrCam Hear specializes in filtering and amplifying only the essential voices. This advanced feature allows you to focus on your conversation, even in crowded rooms where background noise is overwhelming.\nFor daily use, OrCam Hear functions as standard OTC hearing aids, enhancing ambient sounds to match your hearing requirements. The innovation shines in noisy settings: with an iPhone and a dongle, you can quickly create 'voice signatures' for people you're conversing with. This process, taking only seconds, enables you to isolate and amplify voices of specific people by activating their profiles.\nCurrently, OrCam is awaiting certification for these hearing aids as OTC devices. The company anticipates shipping later this year, with pricing yet to be announced.\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nRobotic mop vacuums promise to take floor-cleaning off your hands for weeks, but often fall short of perfection. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra earns our Top Pick award with its three ingenious solutions to common robotic cleaning challenges: efficient corner cleaning, hair-tangle prevention, and keeping carpets dry during combined mopping and vacuuming.\nUnique among its round counterparts, the S8 MaxV Ultra excels in corner cleaning. It features an innovative spinning FlexiArm that reaches into corners to sweep debris, complemented by a side brush that activates specifically for corners.\nThe DuoRoller Riser Brush is another remarkable feature. This dual brush system efficiently captures debris and prevents hair entanglement, thanks to integrated scrapers.\nMost notably, the S8 MaxV Ultra elevates its mop head up to 20 mm, ensuring dry, clean carpets during vacuuming sessions. And both the mop and brush roll to lift away when docking, preventing debris fallout.\nOn top of these innovations, it boasts an auto-emptying, self-cleaning dock, options for hot water and detergent mopping, and automatic dirt detection so the robot will return to base for self-cleaning if the mop heads become too dirty to clean efficiently.\nSet to launch in April 2024 at $1,799.99, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra redefines automated floor cleaning.\nSamsung Music Frame\nThe Samsung Music Frame offers a unique suite of features that seamlessly blend art appreciation with sound quality. Unlike other artwork speakers, the Music Frame offers the flexibility to utilize your own art, while delivering robust sound and full SmartThings integration.\nAs its name implies, the Music Frame doubles as a 14-by-14-inch picture frame. This innovative design lets you showcase any image of your choice, transforming your speaker into a personalized art display. Changing the displayed artwork is as simple as popping off the frame and inserting a new photo, offering endless possibilities to match your decor and mood.\nIn terms of sound, the Music Frame has an impressive 120 watts of power, sourced from two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers. This powerful configuration is ideal for small rooms, delivering crisp, immersive sound. For an enhanced audio experience, you have the option to pair two units for stereo sound.\nEnhancing its versatility, the Music Frame seamlessly integrates with Samsung TVs via the SmartThings app, allowing you to use multiple units as stereo or surround sound speakers.\nSlated for release in Spring 2024, the pricing details of the Music Frame are yet to be announced, promising to add a touch of sophistication and innovation to any space.\nSennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4\nAmidst a sea of high-quality true wireless earbuds, the feature-packed Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 caught our ears for being among the first to support Auracast. Auracast is set to revolutionize public audio experiences in venues such as airports, bars, gyms, movie theaters, stadiums, and concert halls by streaming audio directly to headphones. Imagine lounging at the airport with music, yet staying alert to gate changes, or clearly hearing announcers at noisy stadiums \u2013 all made possible by Auracast.\nBeyond public broadcasting, Auracast allows audio sharing from personal devices like phones, tablets, and computers to multiple listeners. In addition, Auracast technology is being integrated into TVs. It was recently added to Samsung\u2019s 2023 Neo QLED 8K and Micro LED TVs, as well as the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2, via a firmware update.\nThe MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 earbuds don't just stop at Auracast; they excel in other areas too. They support high-end audio standards such as aptX Lossless, aptX Adaptive Audio, Bluetooth LE Audio, and the LC3 format. The earbuds boast a robust 7.5-hour battery life, extendable with three additional charges from their Qi wireless charging case. Plus, a quick eight-minute charge provides an hour of playtime.\nThese innovative earbuds, priced at $299.95, will be available for pre-order starting February 15.\nTCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G Tablet\nThe TCL TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G combats eye fatigue and blue light issues with its innovative NXTPAPER 3.0 technology that lets you easily switch between a standard vibrant tablet display and a gentler, more paper-like experience.\nThe NXTPAPER 3.0 surpasses its predecessor with several major enhancements: its circularly polarized display allows light to pass through while blocking reflections, thereby reducing glare and eye strain. It's also 200 nits brighter, reaching a total of 700 nits, and offers faster performance. And the TCL Tab 10 adds a new toggle switch on the case to make switching between display modes simple.\nBeyond its display, the 10.4-inch TCL TAB NXTPAPER 5G runs on Android 14 and is powered by an octa-core processor, accompanied by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Expect its arrival this spring, with pricing details yet to be announced.\nWithings BeamO\nMost people have a thermometer in their home med kit, but the Withings BeamO transforms the home into a mini doctor's office. The compact tool combines four crucial health monitoring devices into one: a digital stethoscope, a clinical-grade thermometer, a blood oxygen level sensor, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine.\nWhat sets the BeamO apart is its ability to perform a quick health check-up in under a minute and detect things like fever, infection, and heart-related issues such as atrial fibrillation (AFib) from the comfort of home. These features are particularly valuable for those with chronic conditions, the elderly, or anyone needing regular monitoring.\nIn today's digital age, the ability to share health data with healthcare providers remotely is vital. BeamO facilitates this, especially during telehealth consultations, by allowing audio streaming through the Withings app so a doctor can listen to your heart or lungs.\nThe BeamO is expected to become available in June 2024 for $249.95, following FDA clearance for the ECG.\n[Image credit: Techlicious, EssilorLuxottica]\nNews, Computers and Software, Phones and Mobile, Music and Video, Health and Home, Blog, Top Picks\nDiscussion\nFrom Robert Mayer on January 13, 2024 :: 6:19 pm\nI enjoyed reviewing your selections from the masses of new introductions shown at the 2024 CES.

        "raw_content": "6 Major Trends To Expect From CES 2024\nGet ready for AI in everything.\nHere we go again: CES (aka the Consumer Electronics Show) officially kicks off tomorrow, running from January 9\u201312. The world\u2019s largest consumer electronics show returns to Las Vegas to set the technology trends for the year.\nLast year, BMW trotted out its mesmerizing color-changing i Vision Dee electric car, we got a glimpse at wireless TVs, and we checked out the weird world of AR smart glasses and VR headsets for your face.\nWe expect to see more of that, but there\u2019s one tech buzzword you can count on hearing a lot: AI. You can bet on artificial intelligence being everywhere \u2014 even in devices where it might make little sense. But such is the nature of CES. It\u2019s a place to see the future before everyone inevitably lives it.\nInverse will be covering all the CES announcements that are worth reading about. Be sure to bookmark our CES 2024 hub page to stay informed. Now, let\u2019s get to what the crystal ball is showing.\n6. AI In Everything\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED M4 and G4 TVs have built-in AI that can automatically adjust picture settings based on the context of what\u2019s happening within movies and TV shows.\nFor better or worse, artificial intelligence \u2014 in its many forms through machine learning, or generative via large language models (LLMs) \u2014 is going to be in virtually every new gadget. TVs, laptops, phones, tablets, cars, gaming systems, smart home devices and home appliances \u2014 you name it, and somebody will be explaining how AI will supposedly transform them into new must-buys.\nIt\u2019s nothing new \u2014 tech giants like Samsung and LG have been shoehorning AI into their devices for years (to tepid reception) \u2014 but with the renewed interest in AI thanks to ChatGPT and LLMs, it seems like anything and everything with a sprinkle of \u201cintelligence\u201d is back on the table.\n5. Laptops with Copilot Button\nDell\u2019s XPS 13, 14, and 16 laptops have the new Copilot AI button (to the right of the second Alt key).\nAhead of CES, Microsoft announced new Windows 11 PCs will come with a Copilot button for bringing up the AI chatbot that\u2019s now baked into its operating system. As Inverse Senior Editor James Pero explained, the addition of the Copilot button to PC keyboards is a big deal \u2014 proof that Microsoft is all in on AI and chatbots playing a significant role on desktops and laptops.\nPC makers like Dell (XPS 13, 14, and 16) and Acer (Swift Go 14 and 16) have already announced laptops with the new Copilot button. If you\u2019re in the market for a new Windows laptop, get familiar.\n4. Tons of Handheld Gaming PCs\nThe Steam Deck created the whole \u201chandheld\u201d gaming PC category.\nValve\u2019s Steam Deck validated handheld gaming PCs as a product category in 2022. Last year, we saw the start of some real competitors in the Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and the myriad Ayaneo models. Now that handheld gaming PCs are a full-blown category, we\u2019re expecting other PC brands to get in the game. The MSI Claw recently leaked and from the looks of it, the device will have specs that could blow away Asus\u2019 ROG Ally.\nThere\u2019s no doubt CES 2024 will be crawling with handheld gaming PCs from brands big and small. Will Razer bring out a proper handheld PC instead of the half-baked Razer Edge 5G that landed with a thud a year ago?\n3. Generative AI Cozies Up to Smart Homes\nLarge language models could reboot voice assistants like Alexa with more intelligence.\nWe thought last year\u2019s CES would revitalize interest in the smart home and voice assistants. Aside from more devices with Matter built-in, the smart home announcements were pretty mild, with more of the same old.\nHowever, with AI, specifically ChatGPT and large language models, smart home devices might get an actual injection of intelligence. LLMs have the potential to support voice assistants with way more data and knowledge than was previously possible with pre-programmed databases. At the very least, we should get a glimpse of how the smart home will become smarter.\n2. More EVs and more E-Bikes\nWe\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019re saying it again: CES is kind of a car show, specifically one with a sizable EV presence. At last year\u2019s show, Sony had Afeela, BMW had the i Vision Dee, Ram had its 1500 Revolution concept truck, Vinfast announced it\u2019s making e-bikes, and we got a preview of Hyundai\u2019s crab-walking parking tech, to name a few highlights.\nNow that the EV revolution is well on its way, we\u2019re not expecting many groundbreaking technologies but more iterative innovations. Think EV batteries that charge faster and get longer range. And, of course, there will surely be a flashy concept or two, and EVs with larger dashboard and passenger displays, more immersive spatial speaker systems, and dazzling interior lighting.\nThings could be more interesting with e-bikes. Electric bicycles are transforming cities worldwide. Whether it\u2019s a simple motor that converts a regular bike into an electric one, a high-tech \u201csmart\u201d e-bike such as a VanMoof, or cargo e-bikes like a Cake or UBCO, there should be many to see in Las Vegas. Mostly, we\u2019re hoping to see more affordable e-bikes across the whole spectrum, which would be a win for all consumers.\n1. Here Come the Apple Vision Pro Competitors\nXreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra smart glasses is touted as a \u201cspatial computer\u201d without the bulk of the Apple Vision Pro or Quest 3.\nApple Vision Pro will be one of, if not the biggest, product launch of the year. As is the case with every new Apple product, there\u2019s always a ripple effect. CES will no doubt be filled with headsets and smart glasses of all varieties this year. There will be headsets that look similar to Vision Pro, but only do a few things, like give you a giant virtual display. Many of them will probably run on Qualcomm\u2019s new XR2+ Gen 2 chipset.\nWhether they have high-res displays and performance like Vision Pro or cater more to VR or AR like Meta\u2019s Quest 3 or Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra smart glasses, mixed reality headsets and video glasses are likely to become mainstream this year as tech companies look to offer something at different price points.\nINVERSE brings you everything from the fun and futuristic world of consumer technology at CES 2024.

It's also powered by a processor that improves overall display performance and visuals by 70 percent compared to the previous-gen chip, according to LG. Its OLED TV lineup is also getting bigger with the expected launch of the LG Signature OLED M4 and OLED G4 TVs. Both have Alpha 11 AI processor chips embedded in their design, which are meant to improve their image quality. The AI chips promise to reduce visual blurring and improve color contrasts.\nThere are some other big developments worth getting excited about in its display offerings \u2014 but in the gaming sphere. LG also announced a 27-inch QHD OLED gaming display with an extremely fast 480Hz refresh rate.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.
