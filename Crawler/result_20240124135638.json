        "raw_content": "Himiway Showcases Impressive Lineup Of E-Bikes At CES 2024\nHimiway has sporty riders in its crosshairs with the launch of a range of new e-MTBs.\nCalifornia-based e-bike brand Himiway has always been about affordable and practical electric bicycles. The brand was present at CES 2024, and for the first time, showcased a selection of high-performance models aimed towards enthusiasts looking to hit the trails aboard a powerful and sporty two-wheeler. It\u2019s clear to see that Himiway is upping its game in terms of build and features, as the bikes it showcased at CES are equipped with carbon frames and high-end components. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThe new X5 Pro and X5 Ultra undoubtedly stole the show. Both built as long-travel enduro electric mountain bikes, the X5 series rolls on 27.5-inch wheels shod in Schwalbe Tacky Chan and Magic Mary tires for maximum traction on rugged terrain. The bikes care also equipped with high-end RockShox suspension and Sram Code Ultimate brakes for maximum performance. As mentioned earlier, the bikes\u2019 carbon frames keep weight low and rigidity high, while a powerful Bafang M500 mid-drive motor delivers 500W of nominal output and 95 Nm of torque.\nUp next, the Zebra and Cobra Pro cater to riders looking to go anywhere in style and comfort. These fat-tire adventurers are perfect for tackling sandy, muddy, and even snowy terrain, as they feature a powerful 1,000W motor which delivers a top speed of 28 miles per hour. Most notably, the Cobra Pro gets a fancy full-suspension frame, triple crown fork, and chunky 26x4.8 tires. Meanwhile, the Zebra focuses more on accessibility with its low step-through frame, but nevertheless, promises go-anywhere capability thanks to a suspension fork and knobby Kenda Krusade tires.\nLast but not least, Himiway also showcased the new A7 Pro, a bike that promises maximum urban comfort thanks to its accessible, step-through frame, and full-suspension setup. The mid-drive motor offers impressive performance, while its 48V, 720-watt-hour battery pack promises impressive range on a single charge. Furthermore, riders can fine-tune ergonomics by way of a height-adjustable stem. Lastly, urban security isn\u2019t left out of the equation thanks to a built-in wheel lock. Specifics such as the motor\u2019s power output and claimed range figures for this model have yet to be announced.\nAs of this writing, Himiway has yet to announce the pricing of its new models. However, if their current model range is anything to go by, we can expect these new models to command quite an attractive price tag while boasting some thoroughly premium components and features. With that said, be sure to stay tuned for more details as we bring you the detailed specs and features of each model as we find out more about them.\nMore Innovations Showcased At CES 2024:\nSources: Himiway via Instagram, Clean Rider\nTrending\nCar Buying Service\nGet upfront price offers on local inventory.\nSearch for:\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article"

Against this backdrop, Himiway delivered a display that portrayed the cutting-edge spirit of CES and made good its promise to announce breakthrough advancements in the e-bike industry. Attendees who visited our booths were not disappointed. But do not worry if you did not attend; we are gradually launching these new products at the exhibition on our official website this year. So, please stay tuned.\nHimiway's CES 2024 Exhibition - A Recap\nHimiway's appearance at CES 2024 was truly remarkable; we repeatedly proved our dedication to shaking up the status quo of\u00a0electric bikes.\u00a0With our thoughtfully designed and spacious exhibition area, we captivated visitors by showcasing our commitment to innovation and the latest advancements in technology. The layout of our display effectively engaged attendees and provided them with a firsthand experience of our cutting-edge offerings. It was an opportunity for visitors to explore the exciting possibilities of our electric bikes and witness the progress we've made in pushing the boundaries of the industry.\nUpon entering the exhibition room, we welcomed our guests with a display of our most recent electric bike series - Family, All-terrain, Discovery, and Ultra. Each series had its section, allowing participants to learn about each model's qualities and features.\nPreparing for CES 2024 was a complex process; Months of diligent planning, design considerations, and collaboration among our team members helped shape Himiway's presentation at CES.\nOur goal was clear: not only to showcase electric bikes but also to establish a new benchmark for innovation within the industry. Every aspect of our presentation was carefully aligned with the overarching theme of pushing boundaries through captivating design aesthetics and groundbreaking technology.\nThe show's star was undeniably the unveiling of eight new electric bike models across four distinct series.\u00a0This significant release firmly\u00a0sets us apart from our competitors.\nThe C Series - Family Series:\nWe designed this with safety in mind; this kid electric bike has a 50-mile range and durable hydraulic brakes for a secure ride. It also prioritizes comfort and enjoyment for young riders.\nThe C3 is versatile and comes equipped with a multifunctional rear rack and front basket to meet the demands of families by accommodating cargo and passengers, making it easy to move your pets.\nYep! We now have an electric motorcycle. The flagship electric motorbike has a motorcycle-style frame for high performance and speed and a dual suspension system for an optimal riding experience.\nThe D Series - All-terrain Series:\nThe D5 is an improved premium all-terrain electric bike with a mid-drive and torque sensor. It builds on the success of the D5 (Himiway Zebra) and offers a better riding experience both on and off-road.\nIf you love the Himiway Cobra Pro, you will love the D7 PRO even more. It\u2019s an upgraded version of the Himiway Cobra Pro (D7 Pro), designed for extreme off-road riding with upgraded transmission, suspension, and braking systems, resulting in an increased experience.\nThe A Series - Discovery Series:\nThe A7 Pro is our first mid-drive full-suspension commuter e-bike in the market, and it combines a four-bar linkage suspension system from mountain bikes with a mid-drive motor, ensuring a superb, comfortable riding experience.\nThe X Series - Ultra Series:\nMarking the launch of the Carbon Fiber Series, these two variations highlight our willingness to keep stretching past the limits of material and design innovation.\nThe Buzz Around Himiway's New Releases\nThe presentation of Himiway's new e-bike models at CES 2024 ignited excitement and enthusiasm. Attendees were drawn in by the beautiful display of our electric bikes, each delivering a distinct combination of innovation and functionality.\nDuring CES 2024, our new releases gained extensive media attention and accolades from various outlets. Notable media and tech reviewers praised us for our creative approach to producing high-quality electric bikes. These reactions showed how well we matched electric bike lovers' interests and desires.\nIn-depth assessments praised the Himiway C1 Kid's safety features for young riders, the adaptability of the C3 for family use, and the high-performance capabilities of the C5 electric motorcycle. The modified D5 Pro and D7 Pro 2024 from the All-terrain Series drew recognition for their improved off-road capabilities, with several media publications naming them benchmarks in their categories.\n\"I was surprised that Himiway is expanding its line so much for 2024, but it has a great base of products and I feel this is a good time to take advantage of a growing market. The real differences I noticed in their designs versus some other manufacturers\u2019 is they are custom designed for the market they are targeting. Some other companies just market generic designs they you can buy from several marketing companies.\" said Paul from\u00a0Cleantechnica.com.\nHow the New Features Align with Current Trends and Consumer Demands:\nThe new e-bike models align with current trends and changing consumer desires. The debut of the C1, designed exclusively for young riders, mirrored a growing trend of delivering safe and entertaining electric bike experiences for children. On the other hand, the C3 is a multipurpose electric cargo bike for families that addresses the growing demand for environmentally friendly transportation options that can transport cargo and passengers. The C5 electric motorcycle addressed the ever-increasing demand for electric vehicles with motorcycle-style frames, appealing to teens looking for speed and power.\nThe modified D5 Pro and D7 Pro 2024 from the All-terrain Series serve the demand for improved off-road capabilities, appealing to our riders looking for more. The A7 Pro from the Discovery Series combines a four-bar linkage suspension system with a mid-drive engine, addressing the need for high-end, comfortable commuter e-bikes.\nThe Ultra Series, which included the X5 Pro and X5 Ultra with carbon fiber construction, represented our response to the growing need for lightweight, robust, and beautiful electric bikes. These features highlighted our ability to adapt to market changes and understand your preferences.\nThe C5 Electric Motorbike - In the Spotlight\nUndoubtedly a show-stopper, the C5 is a breakthrough electric motorcycle that redefines performance, sustainability, and pure riding enjoyment.

Its sturdy frame improves performance and adds to its visually appealing presence on the road. The C5's elegant looks and attentive details make it stand out in the electric motorcycle category.\nHow The C5's Potential Impacts The E-Bike Market And Consumer Lifestyle\nThe spotlight is on the Himiway C5 Electric Motorbike, poised to usher in a transformative age in the e-bike industry.

Here are some reviews and comments from our customers:\n\"That C5 frame is amazing for upgrading, in. They said a top speed of 25, but I believe you should upgrade it to 35mph to get the full experience.\"\n\"Himiway has stepped it up this year; they are moving in the right direction while keeping the prices reasonable.\"\n\"Consumers want... Good speed... Great Range... Good price.\"\nCustomer Feedback Highlights:\n\"Himiway is trying to be a big name!\" (and we are here for it)\nThe overwhelmingly positive media reviews and customer feedback underscore the excitement and anticipation surrounding Himiway's new releases, particularly the C5 Electric Motorbike.

By incorporating mountain bike features and a full-suspension system into an urban commuter bike, we hope to spark a trend in the industry towards more sophisticated and comfortable commuter e-bikes.\nThe Ultra Series, featuring the X5 Commute and X5 Mountain, introduces carbon fiber, known for its strength and lightness. This move could set a precedent for other manufacturers to explore the benefits of carbon fiber in their designs, potentially influencing the materials used in the e-bike industry.\nBehind the Scenes: R&D and Technological Breakthroughs\nIt has become evident that unveiling these cutting-edge electric bike models is not merely the result of chance but a meticulous process driven by extensive Research and Development (R&D).

        "raw_content": "What I Learned At Himiway\u2019s Booth At CES 2024, Plus Its 8 New Models!\nIn this article, I cover news of what Himiway showed at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) while also including what I learned about the company\u2019s existing product line and e-bikes in general.\nCES Announcements\nAt CES 2024, Himiway Bikes announced several exciting new products and innovations in the e-bike industry. The company unveiled four new series and a total of eight new electric bike models set to launch in 2024. These new models include the C1, C3, C5, D5 Pro, D7 Pro, A7 Pro, X5 Pro, and X5 Ultra.\nThe C1 is an electric bike designed for children ages 4-12, with a 50-mile range and reliable hydraulic brakes for safety and comfort. The C3 is a multifunctional electric bike that can carry cargo and passengers, making it a versatile option for families. The C5 is an electric motorbike with a high-performance motor and dual suspension system, providing a dynamic riding experience.\nThe D5 Pro and D7 Pro are commuter e-bikes with powerful motors and long-range batteries, making them ideal for daily commuting. The A7 Pro is a full-suspension commuter e-bike, featuring a mid-drive motor and a four-bar linkage suspension system for a comfortable and smooth ride.\nThe X5 Pro and X5 Ultra are high-performance e-bikes with powerful motors, long-range batteries, and advanced suspension systems for off-road riding.\nIn addition to the new e-bike models, Himiway also showcased its commitment to innovation and sustainability with cutting-edge e-bike technology demonstrations and interactive experiences at their booth.\nC1 Kids E-Bike\nThis new model aimed at kids from 4 to 12 years old has a 350W motor and a durable aluminum frame that can support 165 pounds. This is Himiway\u2019s first e-bike without pedals, reminiscent of the Rupp minibike my friend let me enjoy occasionally while growing up, without the pollution, hassles, and maintenance they require. With safety being a top priority, the C1 features both hydraulic and electronic braking systems. This means when you apply the brakes, it cuts off the power to the motor so that your brakes aren\u2019t fighting the motor. The bike can be set to 3 different speed modes, so that as your child gets better skills and judgement, you can upgrade it from low speed (7 mph) to mid speed (13 mph) to high speed (15 mph). This way the e-bike can grow with your child and you don\u2019t end up having to buy 3 different products for your child as they grow. With a 50-mile range, you will likely run out of energy before the e-bike does. At a price point of $799, it is an affordable investment designed to last many years.\nC3 Cargo Bike & C5 Electric Motorbike\nThe C3 Cargo isn\u2019t out yet, but it is an upgrade to the Big Dog currently available at $1,999. Himiway will also offer an optional extended seat and pegs so that you can bring one or two kids with you on this e-bike.\nThe C5 Motorbike is also not yet available, but with the whole new frame, it is a significant expansion for the company into a whole new market segment.\nD5 Pro & D7 Pro All-Terrain E-Bikes\nThe D5 Pro (also known as the Zebra Pro) features a powerful 750W motor and a battery providing a range up to 60 miles. The newly upgraded model offers the durability of a mid-drive motor and a torque sensor. I had the chance to drive one of their bikes with a torque sensor around the crowded CES floor, and the smoothness of it helped me not run anyone over. I have found that cadence sensor on some e-bikes can cause the electric boost to be sudden and unexpected at times, so I really appreciated the torque sensor. The D7 Pro (also known as the Cobra Pro) has a 1000W mid-drive motor, and with upgrades to its transmission, suspension, and braking systems is capable of extreme off-road capabilities.\nDiscovery Series: A7 Pro\nThe upcoming A7 Pro from their Discovery Series is a top-of-the-line electric city commuter bike equipped with a mid-drive and full suspension. Redefining the norms, they have incorporated innovative mountain bike characteristics into urban commuter bikes. The A7 Ultra, a pioneering mid-drive full-suspension commuter e-bike, combines a four-bar linkage suspension system with a mid-drive motor, guaranteeing an exceptional and enjoyable riding experience.\nUltra Series: X5 Pro, X5 Ultra\nThese two new lightweight carbon fiber e-bikes are aimed at consumers looking for the lowest weight, making the bike easier to transport and improving handling. Carbon fiber also allows aerodynamic shapes, reducing wind resistance and allowing increased speed and range. It also looks really cool!\nRambler\nAlthough this bike isn\u2019t new, this it the bike I test drove and felt best meets my needs for commuting. It looks pretty boring compared to the new models, but it is what I like for a daily driver. I loved the smooth feel of the power delivery enabled by the torque sensor and like the practicality of the cargo rack and fenders. The step-thru frame makes it easy to ride without lifting your leg over the back.\nConclusion\nI\u2019d like to thank Todd Fisher from the Himiway team for taking the time to educate me on all their new models and explaining the technology in a way that was very understandable. I was surprised that Himiway is expanding its line so much for 2024, but it has a great base of products and I feel this is a good time to take advantage of a growing market. The real differences I noticed in their designs versus some other manufacturers\u2019 is they are custom designed for the market they are targeting. Some other companies just market generic designs they you can buy from several marketing companies.\nI also think their two-year parts and labor warranty is an important part of their value proposition. You work with one of their 350 dealers to resolve any problems, or if you aren\u2019t close to a dealer, they will support you directly and ship you any parts needed and videos on how to replace them.\nDisclosure: I am a shareholder in Tesla [TSLA], BYD [BYDDY], Nio [NIO], XPeng [XPEV], Hertz [HTZ], NextEra Energy [NEP], and several ARK ETFs.

In 2024, the abundance of possibilities might be daunting, making it critical to find the best ones. E-bikes can become your favorite mode of transportation, whether for carrying groceries from the store or planning an adventure vacation with all-terrain biking routes.\nHowever, with so many models available, selecting the best e-bike for your lifestyle can take time and effort. That is why Himiway has compiled this list of the finest electric bikes of 2024.\nWhen evaluating the Himiway bike, we looked at everything that matters: price, specs, age, and purpose of what the ride is for. We've broken it into categories to make it easy to see why the Himiway bike stands out.\nThe Ultimate Choice for Most Adults: The Himiway Zebra\nFor adults seeking an exceptional electric biking experience, the Himiway Zebra Premium all-terrain Electric Fat Bike is the best choice. The Zebra takes commuting to another level with its powerful 750W geared hub motor and upgraded inner ring. Riding should be joyful; its 26-inch Kenda fat tire helps improve traction, preventing slipping on the ground and sinking in mud or snow.\nWith a removable 48V 20Ah Samsung/LG battery capacity, the riding mileage of the Zebra e-bike is up to 80 miles per single charge with pedal assist and less range anxiety. Himiway Zebra is made to take advantage of various terrains, including rough terrains, and riding over gravel is very comfortable. It can carry 400lb of total payload, including your weight and the load you\u2019re carrying. If you purchase the Himiway Zebra now, you will get the bike and include free accessories: a fender kit, rear rack, and repair tool.\nUnique Features of Himiway Zebra\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n400lb\nMotor\n750W brushless gear\nRange\n80 Miles per single charge\nTop Speed\nMax 25 MPH\nPedal Assist Intelligent\n0-5 level\nBike frame\nUpgraded 6061 Aluminum\nNumber One Pick for Young Riders: Himiway C1\nGetting an electric bike suitable for your kids, like the Himiway Kids Electric Bike C1, is an excellent move for the new year. Its pedal assist makes it possible for Kids between 4 and 12 to pivot quickly with a perfect battery capacity that can last up to 50 miles on a ride. Because all kids won\u2019t be on the same riding level, a 3-speed mode is included in the bike.\nAs safety is paramount, the braking system with the C1 Is a hydraulic brake, the same as you can find in a Himiway\u2019s standard electric bike. It is built to adult standards, but specifically for kids. Also, it has a soft, comfy saddle long enough to accommodate two kids. It has a payload capacity of 165lb; you can see why it can accommodate two kids on a ride. Without ignoring different places with their terrains, the Himiway C1 has an impressive tire that can handle different terrains. There are many reasons to choose the C1 as the right bike for your kids. Also, its foot pedals are not metal but plastic, so each young rider can have grip and traction while riding.\nUnique Features of Himiway C1\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n165lb\nMotor\n350W Geared hub\nRange\n45 \u2013 50 Miles\nBattery\n36V 10Ah LG Lithium battery\nSpeed mode\n3-speed\nBike Frame\n6061 Aluminum frame\nBrake System\n160mm Hydraulic Brake\nWarranty\n2-Year including 15-day return\nShipping\nFree shipping within the US\nTop Choice for Mountain Biking: Himiway Cobra Series\nThe Himiway Cobra series stands tall in the dynamic world of electric mountain bikes, gaining the renowned title of unrivaled champion in off-road cycling. We know that riding through the mountain routes can be complex and challenging, so the Himiway Cobra Electric Mountain Bike has 26 x 4.8 inches of super fat tire that can overcome any of this. The tire can't do the work alone; it also uses a robust high-end four-bar linkage suspension and coil suspension that absorb any bumps on the trail, making riding more stable for all road conditions.\nWith a perfect battery capacity, you can ride as long as 80+ miles on a single charge. If you need nothing but the best, the Himiway Zebra series should be your choice because it blends power and durability to produce an electric mountain bike that can push beyond the limits of any trail.\nUnique Features of\u00a0Himiway Cobra\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n400lb\nMotor\n1000W Mid-Drive\nRange\n80 Miles per single charge\nTop Speed\nMax 31 MPH\nPedal Assist Intelligent\n0-5 level\nBattery\n48V 20Ah Samsung/ LG Battery\nBike frame\n6061 Aluminum\nTire Size\n26 X 4.8 inches Kenda Fat Tire\nTop Affordable Electric Bike: Himiway Cruiser\nDiscover an improved riding experience with the Himiway Cruiser Long Range Fat Tire Electric Bike, which features innovative elements such as a torque sensor at an accessible price. You won't find a cheap electric bike that has technology like pedal assistance, an LED screen display, a reasonable frame, and an excellent braking system that ensures a smoother and more efficient ride with better mileage.\nThe Cruiser has a torque sensor and practical features such as built-in turn signals, wider tires, and a larger motor for better bicycling on rougher roads and slopes. Despite the modest weight increase, the torque sensor's ability to deliver a fantastic experience, particularly for beginner e-bike enthusiasts, makes the Cruiser a worthwhile investment.\nUnique Features of Himiway Cruiser\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n350lb\nMotor\n750W Geared Hub\nRange\n60 Miles per single charge\nTop Speed\nMax 25 MPH\nPedal Assist Intelligent\n0-5 level\nBattery\n48V 17.5Ah Samsung/ LG Battery\nBike frame\nUpgraded 6061Aluminum\nAn outstanding choice for a moped e-bike: Moped E-Bike\nIf you are looking for a lightweight electric bike with standard features, the Himiway Escape Pro Long Range Moped-Style Electric Bike should be your pick. Considering its specs, the Himiway Pro is a 750W e-bike with a speed of 26 miles per hour if unlocked. A removable 48v 17.5 Ah battery powers the bike. The Himiway Escape Pro looks like other moped-style step-thru bikes in its class and features. But it's better with an integrated rear rack with a payload capacity of about 300 pounds.\nThe frame is made from 6061 aluminum and is a step-through, making it accessible for all riders of different sizes. Regarding the components,\u00a0the Himiway Escape has a Shamano 7-speed transmission system, front suspension shock, and mechanical brakes. It is straightforward to handle, and its turning radius is easy to maneuver.

The Himiway Cruiser All-Terrain Step-Thru Electric Bike is considered the best electric bike with a fat tire; its 26-inch fat tires provide adequate traction and anti-vibration capability.\nIt has a top speed of 25 mph, a range of up to 55 miles, and a weight capacity of 300 pounds. Pre-installed fenders and a rear rack are included to keep you safe from water splashes and dirt while hauling pannier bags and other essentials for your e-bike adventure. It is a very versatile and incredibly affordable electric bike with an excellent value price. It feels more like a torque bike because more torque sensors are installed.\nUnique Features of Himiway Step Thru\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n350lb\nMotor\n750W Geared Hub\nRange\n60 Miles per single charge\nTop Speed\nMax 25 MPH\nPedal Assist Intelligent\n0-5 level\nBattery\n48V 17.5Ah\nBike frame\nUpgraded 6061Aluminum\nBest cargo E-bike:\u00a0 Himiway Big Dog\nThe Himiway Big Dog is considered an electric cargo bike because of its large rear rack.

Speaking of power, you will find the bike installed with a 750W motor. The real power comes from the rear wheel, and both wheels are 20-inch Meg rims, which means you will never have to deal with any issues concerning discomfort.\u00a0 It wears a four-inch fate tire, which makes riding around gravel roads more comfortable and controllable.\nThe Big Dog is versatile and can be equipped with interchangeable accessories for all your cargo needs, including a seat pad and rails, a hitch rack, and a rear and front-mounted basket with a cargo trailer.\nUnique Features of Himiway Big Dog\nFeatures\nSpecification\nPayload Capacity\n400lb\nMotor\n750W Geared Hub\nRange\n80 Miles per single charge\nTop Speed\nMax 25 MPH\nPedal Assist Intelligent\n0-5 level\nBike frame\nUpgraded 6061Aluminum\nBest commuter E-bike: Himiway Rambler\nNow is the perfect moment to switch from local automobile rides to the easily parkable Himiway Rambler City Commuter Electric commuter bike.

        "raw_content": "Himiway Showcases Impressive Lineup Of E-Bikes At CES 2024\nCalifornia-based e-bike brand Himiway has always been about affordable and practical electric bicycles. The brand was present at CES 2024, and for the first time, showcased a selection of high-performance models aimed towards enthusiasts looking to hit the trails aboard a powerful and sporty two-wheeler. It\u2019s clear to see that Himiway is upping its game in terms of build and features, as the bikes it showcased at CES are equipped with carbon frames and high-end components. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThe new X5 Pro and X5 Ultra undoubtedly stole the show. Both built as long-travel enduro electric mountain bikes, the X5 series rolls on 27.5-inch wheels shod in Schwalbe Tacky Chan and Magic Mary tires for maximum traction on rugged terrain. The bikes care also equipped with high-end RockShox suspension and Sram Code Ultimate brakes for maximum performance. As mentioned earlier, the bikes\u2019 carbon frames keep weight low and rigidity high, while a powerful Bafang M500 mid-drive motor delivers 500W of nominal output and 95 Nm of torque.\nUp next, the Zebra and Cobra Pro cater to riders looking to go anywhere in style and comfort. These fat-tire adventurers are perfect for tackling sandy, muddy, and even snowy terrain, as they feature a powerful 1,000W motor which delivers a top speed of 28 miles per hour. Most notably, the Cobra Pro gets a fancy full-suspension frame, triple crown fork, and chunky 26x4.8 tires. Meanwhile, the Zebra focuses more on accessibility with its low step-through frame, but nevertheless, promises go-anywhere capability thanks to a suspension fork and knobby Kenda Krusade tires.\nLast but not least, Himiway also showcased the new A7 Pro, a bike that promises maximum urban comfort thanks to its accessible, step-through frame, and full-suspension setup. The mid-drive motor offers impressive performance, while its 48V, 720-watt-hour battery pack promises impressive range on a single charge. Furthermore, riders can fine-tune ergonomics by way of a height-adjustable stem. Lastly, urban security isn\u2019t left out of the equation thanks to a built-in wheel lock. Specifics such as the motor\u2019s power output and claimed range figures for this model have yet to be announced.\nAs of this writing, Himiway has yet to announce the pricing of its new models. However, if their current model range is anything to go by, we can expect these new models to command quite an attractive price tag while boasting some thoroughly premium components and features. With that said, be sure to stay tuned for more details as we bring you the detailed specs and features of each model as we find out more about them."

We may get paid if you buy something or take an action after clicking one of these.\nThe Electric Bikes at CES: All The New E-Bikes on Display\nCarbon Fiber Frames, Integrated Displays, Glossy Paint, and LEDS Galore!\nOur time at the show was limited, but we still managed to see a host of new e-bike models, speak with brands both new and old, and of course, squeeze in a ride. Follow along as we cover some of the latest developments in e-bike technology we saw at CES in Las Vegas!\nHimiway: A Revamped Lineup with a Carbon Fiber Crown Jewel\nPerhaps one of the most unexpected surprises of the show was Himiway\u2019s expansive booth which was brimming with glossy new e-bikes \u2013 some fresh and some familiar. The brand has completely revamped their line of e-bikes with new models, polished aesthetics, upgraded components, and naming conventions which group the bikes by their intended purpose.\nThe rebranded D series of e-bikes, for example, are sportier off-road capable models that are refreshed versions of the old Cobra and Zebra. The D7 Pro, which replaces the Cobra Pro, features upgraded components including a 4-piston brake system, a Shimano CUES drivetrain, a dual-crown inverted suspension fork with 220mm of travel, and a dropper seatpost.\nThe new C line is intended to be family oriented with both child- and adult-sized versions of a new moto/moped-style design. The smaller C1 (pictured below) uses a 350W rear-hub motor and is limited to 15 mph, while the full-size C5 (above) features a 750W motor and a Class 2 limit of 20 mph.\nSide note: while we look forward to testing and reviewing the full-size C5, we are currently working on a review of the C1 kids e-bike. The picture above provides a good indication of what our 6-year old tester, AJ, thinks about it!\nA new cargo/utility bike dubbed the C3 features a long step-thru frame, a 350-lb carrying capacity, and a custom wedge-style saddle. Like the C5, it hosts a 750W motor and 960 Wh battery for extended range capability.\nPerhaps the most visually stunning, however, were the X5 Pro and X5 Ultra carbon-fiber eMTBs. While both tiers of the brand\u2019s new enduro bike will only be available in a single frame size, they will be offered in full-suspension, hardtail, and fat tire variants.\nThe premium X5 Ultra will be equipped with a host of impressive components including a SRAM Eagle drivetrain, a Rockshox BoXXer suspension fork, a Rockshox wireless electronic dropper post, a clean top-tube-integrated display, a tubeless tire setup with carbon rims, and a 500W Bafang M600 mid-drive motor.\nReminiscent of the Rambler, the A7 Pro rounds out the brand\u2019s new lineup. This full-suspension commuter includes a quick-adjust seatpost, a 500W mid-drive, and a display integrated into its adjustable stem.\nUrtopia: Dashing Into the Future with Polished Designs and ChatGPT Integration\nWith all the recent buzz around AI in general and ChatGPT in particular, we were highly intrigued by the idea of integrating such functionality into an e-bike. In addition to offering stylish, futuristic designs for their three unique e-bikes, Urtopia grabbed our attention by being the first to do so.\nThe brand\u2019s flashy carbon fiber flagship, the Carbon Pro 1, features an unexpected design with a seamless, floating top tube/seat tube/seat stay element. The bike houses a 4G eSIM card that allows it to track the bike\u2019s location for phone-free navigation and security, play music through an integrated bluetooth speaker, and connect to ChatGPT.\nOur contact said that the GPT integration can do such things as helping riders set up custom routes, find the nearest coffee shop, or simply ask about the weather forecast. Our personal experiences with ChatGPT lead us to question the reliability of its information (at least in the technology\u2019s current state), but we hope to be able to test the Carbon Pro 1 for ourselves in the near future!\nUtopia also offers a more entry-level \u2013 but still impressively feature-saturated \u2013 alloy-frame city/commuter called the Chord. While it does not integrate with ChatGPT, this e-bike still offers navigation, music, etc. and pairs with the Urtopia app. The bike uses a 350W rear-hub motor with a torque sensor paired with a 353 Wh battery.\nA currently unreleased model, the Fusion, features a carbon fiber step-thru frame, dual 350W front and rear hub motors, and dual batteries (one main and one auxiliary/range extender) with a total of 860 Wh and a max range of 120 miles.\nA second version of the Fusion was offered for European cyclists; in addition to a flashier paint job, this model featured a 250W Bafang mid-drive motor that will not (currently) be available in the US.\nVanpowers: Affordable Adventure Bikes with Integrated Security Tech\nAfter being pleasantly surprised during our review of the UrbanGlide Ultra, we were excited to see the latest developments from Vanpowers. With two new offerings including a carbon fiber gravel bike and a beefy fat tire touring bike, the brand is clearly interested in diversifying their lineup and proving their competence in off-road environments.\nThe Ultra version of the fat tire GrandTeton features a 500W Bafang mid-drive and 692 Wh battery, while the more budget-friendly Pro version uses a rear-hub motor. Both have a \u201csmart box\u201d integrated into the top tube with 4G and GPS functionality for navigation and theft protection, but also an SOS feature that can alert a pre-selected contact in the event of a hard impact.\nThe 39-lb UrbanCross also features the smart hub, and is available in an Ultra version with 46cm flared drop bars or a Pro version with flat bars; both will be offered in three frame sizes. Regardless of tier, the bike uses a 250W rear hub motor with a torque sensor, a 345.6 Wh battery, a stem-integrated display, and Bluetooth connectivity with the Vanpowers app.\nHeybike: Taking a Chance with Crowdfunded Carbon Fiber\nHeybike made an appearance with three new models, including a full-suspension version of the Ranger S called the Horizon, a cargo e-bike called the Hauler, and a full-suspension, carbon fiber fat tire bike called the Hero.\nWhile details were scarce, the Hero was the star of the show with its unique step-thru frame and flashy orange-and-grey paint job. The bike uses custom carbon fiber handlebars with an integrated display, and is set to be crowdfunded through an indiegogo campaign later this spring.\nOkai: Clean Design and LEDs Are the Future of Commuting\nAs a relative newcomer to the e-bike market, Okai was a behind-the-scenes manufacturer for prominent e-bike and e-scooter brands such as Bird and Lime. Okai launched three new commuter-focused e-bike models after a year of development, all with tech at the forefront.\nThe EB60, also referred to as the Traverse, puts a huge focus on minimalistic design. The bike features an LED light bar that stretches across the full length of the handlebars for visibility, but its color and pattern can be customized to suit the rider through the Okai app. The bike uses a 350W rear hub motor with a torque sensor and an integrated 345.6 Wh battery.\nWe were impressed by the 440 lb weight capacity of the brand\u2019s utility e-bike called the EB70. Another step-thru commuter called the EB80 uses an integrated battery with LED light bars that change color to reflect battery charge.\nLooking Ahead: Design Trends for 2024\nA clean and streamlined aesthetic seems to be the new norm, with brands opting for weld-free carbon fiber frames, fully integrated batteries, seamlessly integrated displays, and automotive-quality paint jobs.\nWe can\u2019t wait to get our hands on some of these models for an even more detailed look!\nReader Interactions\nComments\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:50 am\nNo mention of the Fuell Flluid? It was (supposedly) at the Valeo booth.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 2:50 pm\nWe really wanted to get over there to see that one, but unfortunately our time was limited! Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to stay longer next year.\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 12:02 pm\nThanks for at least wanting to. As you may or may not have noticed there isn\u2019t a single mention anywhere online from anyone not named Fuell or Valeo that talked about it. Nothing Google knows about, nothing on YouTube, and nothing on Instagram.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 9:21 am\nThat\u2019s surprising, but also not. The e-bike booths were kind of scattered, so it\u2019s possible many outlets didn\u2019t even know Fuell had a presence.\nGroucho says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:30 pm\nThe Himiway C3 looks interesting. Similar to the Gazelle Easyflow, but without the comfortable bars. Cannot say about the riding position without riding it.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 10:10 am\nAgreed! We\u2019re curious about the saddle, too.\nDaniel Dickman says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 1:57 pm\nThe future is here,Baby!!! Enjoy!!!\nJaimee says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 10:35 pm\nI\u2019m kind of (pleasantly) surprised that the trend isn\u2019t toward ever more powerful motors. Apparently a 750w motor isn\u2019t the new baseline; maybe we\u2019ll see the throttle disappear on some models, too.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.
