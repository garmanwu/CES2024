Demonstrations at the ATSC booth will show how broadcast IP can be used by local stations to offer more choices to viewers, advanced emergency information, unique broadcast \u201cstart over\u201d functions, and more navigation services such as enhanced weather and additional streaming choices launched from the broadcaster\u2019s own application platform.\nUsing the broadcast and broadband functionality of the ATSC 3.0 standard, a\u00a0suite of\u00a0new music video channels\u00a0will be announced at CES that bring app-like interactive music features to broadcast TV\u00a0for the first\u00a0time\u00a0with the support of one of America\u2019s largest broadcasters.\nGlobal Reach: \u00a0Regulators in Brazil are evaluating the physical transmission layer of ATSC 3.0 this coming spring, having already chosen many other ATSC 3.0 technologies for their new system.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 7 best TVs of CES 2024\nThe future of display technology, now\nCES 2024 is in full swing and with it comes yet another year of amazing innovations across a wide range of verticals. But most prominent of all fields seeing massive strides is the world of display technology, wherein a slew of AI image enhancements, transparent screens, and larger sizes are proving to push TVs that much further into the future.\nFrom Samsung to TCL, LG to Hisense, these TVs among the best at CES this year leverage interesting new software enhancements to better picture quality on the fly. Nearly every display firm is touting new leaps and bounds through investments in AI, with improved SoCs presented in the limelight as major game changers heading into 2024.\nAdditionally, as you will eventually hear, display manufacturers are taking onboard audio solutions seriously this year with many necessary upgrades on speakers to better amplify TV sound.\nMaybe most exciting of all, though, is a new string of transparent screens that will allow users increased interactivity and personalization. It might be hard to believe, but at CES 2024 the future is here and it's looking as tantalizing as an 8K OLED with a 100% color gamut.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nLG Signature OLED T\nThe LG Signature OLED T is a culmination of all the work the company has done in the last few years all rolled into one product. It uses the rollable screen technology of the LG Signature OLED R combined with the wireless connectivity box found in last year's LG M3 OLED. The result is a TV that feels utterly futuristic.\nBetween watching your favorite shows, the OLED T just looks like a pane of glass. Sure, you can have it show a firework screen saver or the weather \u2014 which, trust me, does look pretty cool \u2014 but once it's time to watch something, a matte black panel pops up that covers the back of the screen.\nThe result? You get a conversation-starting piece of furniture when you're not watching something and a perfectly fine OLED TV when it's time to turn the lights off and watch your favorite films.\nLG G4 OLED\nThe LG C3 OLED garnered immense love last year, but at CES 2024 the LG G4 OLED is the talk of the town. It leverages a ton of AI enhancements through a new A11 chipset that LG claims will grant it as much as 30% better processing speeds and 70% better graphics fidelity.\nThe G4 comes equipped with a 144Hz refresh rate, both G-Sync and FreeSync, as well as a Brightness Booster Max feature to go along with all of the awesome AI upgrades. Its One Wall Design also ensures you can fit the G4 in practically any space around the house.\nIt's a testament to LG's continued innovation in display technology and it may well put the C4 to shame this year with such incredible enhancements.\nSamsung Transparent MicroLED\nSamsung's transparent microLED is definitely more of a concept at this stage than a functioning TV, but it shows us where display technology is heading in the next few years.\nMicroLED, in case you missed it, uses billions of small LEDs to power the screen. With such a high density, the LEDs can produce a brighter, more colorful image. By adding a transparent panel, you can really get the full effect.\nSo how much will a transparent microLED TV eventually set you back? Well, considering regular microLED TVs can be tens \u2014 even hundreds \u2014 of thousands of dollars, you can bet this one won't be cheap when it eventually reaches our home entertainment centers sometime in the next few years.\nSamsung S95D OLED\nAs one of the best TVs on the market and a major seller for Samsung, it comes as no surprise that the Samsung S95D OLED is among the top displays at CES this year, much akin to the S95C OLED of yesteryear. But what makes its newer iteration so well-rounded and special to make the list two year\u2019s in the running?\nIt\u2019s simple \u2014 a glare free panel (the first of its kind) built on an Infinity One Design display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 70W 4.2.2Ch OTS+ speaker, and Dolby Atmos support. That\u2019s a ton of value packed into quite a small frame \u2014 a frame that\u2019s essentially entirely wireless thanks to Samsung\u2019s nifty Connect One Box.\nTCL QM89 QD Mini LED\nThis stunning 115-inch display takes screen size to all-new heights on a QD Mini LED screen with loads of features baked in making this TCL\u2019s crowning jewel of 2024. Beyond being a gamer\u2019s dream setup through such inclusions as FreeSync Premium and a 120Hz refresh rate (240Hz VRR), the TCL QM89 QD Mini LED sports an impressive 5,000 nits of peak brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones for an incredible range in contrasts and darks.\nTCL also packed in WiFi 6 and ATSC 3.0 tuning for a truly next-gen display. The addition of an Anti-Glare screen is also a wonderful touch, making the TCL QM89 a looker no matter the angle. Built on TCL\u2019s brand-new AIPQ Ultra chipset, the QM89 may well be one of this year\u2019s most incredible highlights and it\u2019s still only January.\nTCL QM8 QD Mini LED\nWhile it might not have that tantalizing 115-in screen, the QM8 QD Mini LED is still one of TCL\u2019s best displays at CES 2024. Unlike its larger brethren, the QM8 ranges from 65\u201d to 98\u201d, gifting it a bit more leeway in everyday households. And, as such, it essentially acts as a more accessible QM89 for those who don\u2019t need all 115-in of screen real estate.\nThe QM8 QD Mini LED is built on TCL\u2019s new AIPQ Pro processor, a step down from the QM89. But, don\u2019t let that fool you. It\u2019s still a mesmerizing screen with up to 5,000 dimming zones, 5,000 nits of peak brightness, and a 97% color gamut on the CDI-P3 scale for near-perfect vibrancy in all of your favorite content. If that wasn\u2019t enough, maybe its punchy, onboard 2.1.2 channel speaker system is?\nWell, if not, there\u2019s always the Game Accelerator to faun over, which allows the QM8 up to 240Hz VRR over its base 120Hz. Extras as seen on its larger cousin, like WiFi 6, ATSC 3.0, and FreeSync Premium Pro all round out the QM8 as an exceptional new TV offering out of CES 2024.\nHisense 110UX ULED\nAt the forefront of Hisense\u2019s 2024 lineup is the 110UX, a 110-in ULED display with a brand new Hi-View Engine X AI processor. It\u2019s a serious OLED contender, with Hisense labeling this as a potential game changer in the market due to upgrades like 10,000 nits of brightness and 40,000 backlight zones, the first of its kind in the industry.\nAnd that\u2019s only the start, as its AI chip can perform some awesome screen enhancements, like dynamically adjusted contrast and depth ratios, so you\u2019re always adamantly immersed in the action on-screen. Other notable features include a 4.2.2 channel speaker with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect support, making any audio output a surefire hit on the 110UX ULED.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Advertisement\nNextGen TV gets a boost at CES 2024\nAfter a difficult 2023, NextGen TV is off to a positive start at CES 2024. Several manufacturers announced support for the standard, and coverage has reached 75%. But challenges remain.\nLast year was tough for the new over-the-air (OTA) transmission standard ATSC 3.0/NextGen TV. The industry had been making small but steady gains in the number of homes using OTA for some time as cord-cutters hooked up antennas to continue to watch local TV. However, Nielsen data showed a year-over-year decline of about 1 million households using OTA in mid-2023. Mid-year, LG announced it would drop support for NextGen TV in 2024 after it lost a patent fight with a company holding multiple ATSC 3.0 patents. Finally, some TV stations turned on DRM encryption of their channels, effectively blocking access from many NextGen TVs and decoding boxes.\nCES 2024 delivered some positive news for the industry that could help shake off some of the 2023 blues.\nTCL says it will offer NextGen TV tuners in its top-of-the-line QM8 line of TVs. The TVs come with Quantum Dot 4K UHD HDR screens, Dolby Atmos sound, 2.1.2 channel speakers, and sizes up to 98\u2033. The NextGen TVs will be available \u201clater this year.\u201d\nMadeleine Noland, President of the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC,) was happy to welcome TCL to the NextGen TV fold:\n\u201cWe are delighted to add TCL to the list of TV makers offering NEXTGEN TV, joining Sony, Samsung, and Hisense.\u201d\nTwelve new markets launched NextGen TV channels in 2023, including New York, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Miami. Ms. Noland says the rollout will continue in 2024:\n\u201cWith U.S. NextGen TV market launches in 2024 coming soon for Chicago, San Diego, and Tucson, we\u2019re projecting that NextGen TV will cross the 75% household reach milestone in February.\u201d\nSuch great reach is certainly good news for ATSC, but only some homes are actually watching the channels. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that 10.4 million compatible devices have been sold in the US. However, it is unclear how many are in use and how many homes are active users. The increased availability of adapter boxes may help consumer adoption grow.\nFew upgrade options have been available for consumers wishing to watch NextGen TV channels without purchasing a new TV. That situation should ease somewhat in 2024. ADTH introduced a NextGen TV-certified device last year for $90 and will expand availability through Walmart this year. Chinese home electronics company Stavix will introduce a receive box later this year. Zinwell showed an ATSC 3.0 receiver box that does not require an internet connection to decode DRM-encrypted TV channels.\nAll told, the ATSC says more than 100 NextGen TV products will be available this year. Moreover, the CTA projects a 45% increase in sales of compatible devices in 2024.\nNot everyone believes the ATSC and CTA forecasts. Tyler Kleinle, aka Antenna Man, usually goes to CES to report on new devices supporting ATSC 3.0. However, he says he won\u2019t be there this year. He cites two primary reasons:\nI share his frustration. I purchased a Sony TV supporting ATSC 3.0 a year ago and can receive 100+ ATSC 1.0 channels. Mid-year, several of my local \u00a0TV channels launched in the format. However, despite contacting Sony and my local broadcasters for help, I still cannot receive the NextGen TV channels. Let\u2019s hope more and cheaper ATSC 3.0 receiver boxes arrive soon, allowing everyone to receive the new channels.\nTags:\u00a0\u00a0Homepage Feature\nRelated Posts\nOne Comment\nJanuary 10, 2024 at 6:10 am\nThis ATSC 3.0 rollout has been quite the disaster. At this point, I\u2019m glad my area hasn\u2019t gotten it yet, because everything just keeps working with my current Tablo on all my devices, and things could only get worse.\nThe only way antenna broadcasts are going to remain relevant is if they work on all of people\u2019s devices. As I don\u2019t expect every device, every phone tablet and TV, to support ATSC 3.0, it follows that some sort of whole home device that distributes ATSC 3.0 is going to be the go-to solution. Of course, that\u2019s only if the people creating and distributing the standard actually want it to work out. I\u2019m not sure that they do. It still seems like the priority is to get that sweet retransmission fee revenue and to make antenna usage as difficult as possible.\nBy the time I\u2019m forced to switch over to ATSC 3.0, perhaps the cable bundle will have declined so much that the broadcasters will have decided to distribute their channels in internet apps for free.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?
