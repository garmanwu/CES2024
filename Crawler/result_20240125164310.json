This marks the fourth consecutive year for Amorepacific to receive the CES Innovation Award.\nThe Authentic Color Master by Tonework, which received the CES 2023 Innovation Award in the Robotics category, is a smart manufacturing system solution for customized makeup products using AI and robot arms. Tonework precisely analyzes the tone of the face on the basis of AI algorithms and then uses robotics to make tailored liquid and Cushion foundations as well as lip products. The device provides optimized color recommendations based on facial recognition technology and color science research. The key technologies featured in Tonework are available for demonstration through Base Picker at Amorepacific Headquarters and Amore Seongsu, Bespoke Neo at the Laneige showroom in Myeongdong, and through the Foundation Factory at Etude store in Sinchon, South Korea.\nThe Cosmechip, which received the CES 2023 Innovation Award in the Home Appliance category, is designed to make personalized skincare products by using active chips containing effective ingredients. Featuring microfluidic channel technology developed by Amorepacific, the device creates uniformly combined formulations using a small amount of water and effective ingredients. Consumers can choose different active chips based on their skin condition and preference. For added convenience, consumers can use drinking water at home to make customized products. The chips can be stored stably for a long period of time because they are prescribed with anhydrous ingredients.\nPark Youngho, the Head of Amorepacific R&I Center said, \"Being the recipient of the CES Innovation Award for four years in a row is the outcome of the persistent R&D efforts that go into developing tailored technologies for our customers. We will continue to devote ourselves to offering our global customers the best and the most products.\"\nList of Amorepacific's technologies that received the Innovation Award at CES 2020-2022\n1) Tailored Facial Mask Pack 3D Printing SystemThis system was developed to address the drawbacks of existing facial masks that fail to take into account different face sizes, the location of features, the skin color and the flaws of each individual's skin. Amorepacific collaborated with Linc Solution in 2017 to develop a customized facial mask-manufacturing device using 3D printing technology. The 3D-printed facial mask technology developed exclusively by Amorepacific takes photos of the user's face to analyze the location and area of different features, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, forehead, cheeks, and the chin, and designs a 2D mask pattern accordingly. The data are analyzed to combine hydrogels containing functional ingredients that are suitable for the skin condition, after which a facial mask is printed in real time through a high-speed 3D printer.\n1) Lip Factory by Color Tailor Smart Factory SystemThe Lip Factory by Color Tailor features both on- and offline-linked AI technology to make lip makeup products on the spot, based on its personalized lip color recommendations that take into account the user's skin tone. This easily controllable system, equipped with a 2,000-color palette, features advanced technology to precisely combine and manage various color pigments in order to manufacture customized lip products.\n2) Formularity - Instant Active Toner Blending DeviceThe Formularity, developed by Amorepacific, won the CES 2021 Innovation Award in the Health & Wellness Category. This device makes a toner using an ampoule tailored to the user's skin concerns. The toner, prepared at a temperature suitable for the skin, is then absorbed into a cotton pad for application. The device allows for customized skin care for different parts of the face using ampoules that contain various effective ingredients. In addition, the process itself is hygienic since toner is prepared on the spot with each use.\n1) Mind-linked BathbotThe Mind Linked Bathbot is a robot that analyzes in real time the user's emotions using brain waves through an 8-sensor headset. It then interprets the data to make a bath bomb with customized, optimized scents and colors for the individual all within a minute.\n2) Myskin Recovery PlatformThe Myskin Recovery Platform is an integrated platform that is designed to quickly assess and monitor the skin's condition to provide a customized solution. Using this next-generation personalized service, the user can diagnose changes on the skin's surface with his or her mobile phone camera and an illuminated mirror, and the moisture and elasticity of the skin with a small sensor. These data are then analyzed through AI to offer a cosmetics prescription, which is updated continuously to improve the skin.\nSOURCE Amorepacific\nModal title\nAlso from this source\nAmorepacific receives the CES Innovation Award for fifth consecutive year\nAmorepacific's 'Lipcure Beam' technology has been honored with the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 (CES 2024) Innovation Award, marking the company's...\nAmorepacific receives the CES Innovation Award for fifth consecutive year\nAmorepacific's 'Lipcure Beam' technology has been honored with the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 (CES 2024) Innovation Award, marking the company's...\nExplore\nCosmetics and Personal Care\nHousehold, Consumer & Cosmetics\nAwards\nTrade Show News\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"

(Further reading: Designing Inclusively: a Primer.)\nIn addition, Nimble will exhibit what is touted as the \"first smart at-home nail salon.\"\nMeanwhile, Amorepacific's Lipcure Beam technology has been honored with the CES 2024 Innovation Award. The\u00a0device reportedly combines lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one unit.\nIts cap houses a\u00a0 sensor capable of diagnosing the condition of the lips, including moisture levels. The cap can be removed to reveal a brush-like makeup applicator that deposits a light-responsive material to the lips and a customized visible light that can, in combination with the material, boost\u00a0the response of riboflavin.\nThis reaction between the light and the deposited material reportedly strengthens the collagen fibers inside the lips, forming a moisturizing barrier on the surface. The result is slowed lip aging, per Amorepacific.\nThe design supports one-handed application and \"employs a universal color system naturally suited for all races and ages.\"\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific's R&I center, said, \"We are profoundly honored that Amorepacific's renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award. The R&I center at Amorepacific will continue to exert extensive efforts, ensuring every customer achieves a satisfying life through their unique beauty and health.\""

This marks the fourth consecutive year for Amorepacific to be the recipient of the CES Innovation Award.\nThe Authentic Color Master by Tonework, which received the CES 2023 Innovation Award in the Robotics category, is a smart manufacturing system solution for customized makeup products using AI and robot arms. Tonework precisely analyzes the tone of the face on the basis of AI algorithms and then uses robotics to make tailored liquid and Cushion foundations as well as lip products. The device provides optimized color recommendations based on facial recognition technology and color science research. The key technologies featured in Tonework are available for demonstration through Base Picker at Amorepacific Headquarters and Amore Seongsu, Bespoke Neo at the Laneige showroom in Myeongdong, and through the Foundation Factory at Etude store in Sinchon.\nThe Cosmechip, which received the CES 2023 Innovation Award in the Home Appliance category, is designed to make personalized skincare products by using active chips containing effective ingredients. Featuring microfluidic channel technology developed by Amorepacific, the device creates uniformly combined formulations using a small amount of water and effective ingredients. Consumers can choose different active chips based on their skin condition and preference. For added convenience, consumers can use the drinking water at home to make customized products. The chips can be stored stably for a long period of time because they are prescribed with anhydrous ingredients.\nPark Youngho, the Head of Amorepacific R&I Center said, \u201cBeing the recipient of the CES Innovation Award for four years in a row is the outcome of the persistent R&D efforts that go into developing tailored technologies for our customers.

The 'Lipcure Beam' cap houses a precision sensor capable of diagnosing the condition of the lips. It instantly detects moisture levels and provides diagnostic results when applied to the lips.
