There are new speakers, power stations, conference call speakers and cleaning products.\nMost of us have a few Anker products in the house, even if its one of the reliable charging products the company sells at a much cheaper price than Apple\u2019s official offerings. The company also does a roaring trade in categories across the tech spectrum. Here\u2019s the pick of the releases.\nAnker SOLIX F3800\nAnker\u2019s portable power stations are hugely useful for keeping gadgets charged for camping trips and power cuts, but the latest model now shipping can power a car and most of the items in your home.\nThe Anker Solix F3800, which raised over $6 million on Kickstarter, offers 6,000 watts of power which is plenty for the appliances in a caravan, or it can replenish an EV battery. It\u2019s such a big old beast, you\u2019ll have to pull it along on wheels like a suitcase.\nIt\u2019s available now, starting at \u00a33,699. It is scaleable too, so you can build an entire replacement for your home power supply too.\nAnker Soundcore Boom 2\nThe sequel to the Boom Bluetooth speaker is coming this spring. The upgraded model, styled after the old school boombox stereos, offers double the power. It\u2019s got LED lights, which pulse to the rhythm of the music. You\u2019ll get 17-hours of battery life and there\u2019s IPX7 water resistance. It floats too, making it ideal for a pool party. It\u2019s going to cost \u00a3119.99.\nAnkerWork S600\nThe conference call device slash speaker, like most other launches at CES, has a heavy infusion of AI. The S600 uses neural network algorithm technology and professional NPU chips to deliver voice recognition in noisy environments. There\u2019s also AI noise suppression tuned with data from 20,000 rooms. There\u2019s also a 15W Qi charging pad to ensure your phone won\u2019t conk out during meetings, while the 360-degree speaker means everyone around the table can hear what\u2019s being said. It\u2019s out in the spring costing \u00a3179.99.\nEufy clean X10 Omni\nAnker\u2019s Eufy smart home brand is launching its latest robot vacuum cleaner and mopping combo with Active Detangling tech that stops hair jamming everything up. There\u2019s self-emptying tech, a new pentagonal mop for better corner cleaning, and it works on all types of floors. There\u2019s also an AI camera that can navigate through the home a little easier. It\u2019s gonna cost 799 Euros from this month.\nYou might like\u2026\nChris Smith is a freelance technology journalist for a host of UK tech publications, including\u00a0Trusted Reviews.

        "raw_content": "Anker officially launching first wave of 15W Qi2 chargers, power banks, and multi-device docks\nAnker is starting off CES 2024 with some exciting updates on the availability of its first Qi2 chargers and power banks. We first got a look at the lineup last fall, and now devices with the refreshed 15W magnetic charging tech are finally here. There\u2019s seven new debuts that all pack the recent Qi2 charging tech.\nAnker\u2019s new Qi2 chargers are finally here! We\u2019ve been waiting on them since back in August when the lineup was first teased alongside the refreshed Nano series that began shipping alongside the iPhone 15. Now it\u2019s finally ready to ship the other new gadgets, with seven new releases entering the MagGo collection.\nEach one of the new chargers arrives with Qi2 support. These are the first and only releases from the company to support the new standard, and are some of the very first releases in the market period to do so. What that actually means is that all of them support full 15W speeds with the same magnetic features as Apple\u2019s own first party MagSafe tech.\nBefore we break down each of the options, here\u2019s all seven of them in a list:\nMy favorite of the new releases is the MagGo Foldable Charging Station. It\u2019s a follow up to last year\u2019s MagSafe Cube, and offers an even more compact 3-in-1 charging setup at $109.99. I\u2019ve personally been using one of these for the past few weeks, and while a full report is on the way, I do have to say that it\u2019s about as small as you can get for packing this much power. It\u2019s not as premium as the MagSafe Cube in terms of build quality, but matches the actual charging specs.\nAs boring as it is, Anker\u2019s new MagGo lineup also happens to have the first Qi2 charger we\u2019ve seen. Just about everything revealed so far has been an upright stand or a multi-device charger. And while Anker of course has those form-factors, it\u2019s also keeping things simple with a $21.99 magnetic charger with the same 15W speeds as the rest of the collection.\nThere\u2019s also some other gear joining the lineup, like an updated version of the MagGo Orb. This 8-in-1 power station has full AC outlets to go alongside USB-C ports and other mobile-focused charging options. The big difference is it now has a 15W magnetic Qi2 pad, as opposed to the 7.5W offering on the original. I\u2019ve been using this one too, and have to say that even with only one key difference, it\u2019s worth the refresh. The same $99.99 price tag remains.\nTwo Anker MagGo power banks with Qi2 tech debut, too\nAlongside the charging stations, there\u2019s also two new Anker Qi2 power banks. The most notable thing about these is that both are some of the very first releases ever to pack 15W MagSafe into a portable battery. Up until now, there has only been 7.5W speeds, even from Apple\u2019s official release. But now you can refuel while out and about with the same power output as your at-home charging setup.\nThere are two entries into the collection here, with the new Anker 10K MagGo Qi2 Power Bank taking the spotlight. This 10,000 mAh release packs a pretty standard design for a portable iPhone 15 battery, with a fold out kickstand that has been standard on many of Anker\u2019s releases. It also has a built-in display on the side for monitoring charging rates and its remaining capacity.\nAnker\u2019s Qi2 power bank can refuel your iPhone 15 nearly two times on a single charge while dishing out those sought-after 15W speeds and clocks in with an $89.99 price tag.\nThe second of the new Anker power banks is far more interesting to me. It features a smaller 6,000mAh battery, but backs that with\u00a0a fold up design that turns into a charging stand. Call it a portable StandBy mount or just an upright charger, but the $69.99 package provides one of the more unique designs we\u2019ve seen. It reminds me of the Satechi power bank I reviewed last year with a very similar approach. Except, now there\u2019s Qi2 tech that makes this a far better iPhone 15 companion.\nWe\u2019re waiting for Anker\u2019s newest chargers to hit the company\u2019s official storefront, as well as other retailers like Amazon. Stay tuned as we share updates about the full availability of the new Qi2 chargers. We\u2019ll have reviews coming soon for quite a few of the chargers, as well.\nAdd 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.\nGoogle News\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!\nGuides\nNews\nAnker\nAbout the Author\nRikka Altland\nRikka Altland's favorite gear\nNintendo Switch\nPhilips Hue Go\nPopular in the Community"

The versatility of the SOLIX C800 Plus is unmatched, featuring a 39.3-inch (100cm) retractable pole that effortlessly transitions into a hanger, tripod, or a selfie stick, allowing users to maximize space while camping.\nWith its 1600-watt output via SurgePad(TM) and a substantial 768Wh capacity, the SOLIX C800 Plus stands ready to power up to 10 devices simultaneously including electric stoves, coffee makers, kettles, and other camping appliances, making outdoor experiences even more comfortable. And with HyperFlash(TM) technology, the C800 Plus can fully recharge in just 58 minutes when connected to a wall outlet, or in just under three hours when paired with solar panels outputting up to 300 watts.\nThe Anker SOLIX C800 Plus Portable Power Station will be available on Anker.com and Amazon later in Q1 2024.\nAnker SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station\nSelected as CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honorees, the Anker SOLIX F3800 is the industry's first portable power station to feature AC coupling and support home solar power cycling when paired with the Anker SOLIX Home Power Panel. This innovation provides users with not only a backup battery, but also an accessible home power solution. The F3800 delivers impressive 6000W AC power output and 120V/240V dual voltage output, enabling it to simultaneously plug-in high-energy devices while powering everything else that runs at 120V.\nIn addition, the AC output power can be elevated up to 12,000W when two F3800 devices are combined. The F3800 boasts a massive 3.84kWh battery capacity to power users' needs. With its expandable form factor, users can customize their power storage needs with up to 53.76kWh when combining two F3800s and up to 12 additional expansion batteries, providing up to two weeks of home backup power.\nThe Anker SOLIX F3800 provides a clean and quiet alternative solution to gas generators, capable of powering an entire home, including RVs. Electric vehicles can also be charged without the need for additional grounding accessories. This means EV users can connect their vehicle's charging cable directly to the Anker F3800, providing a convenient charging solution at home, even when the power is out. The F3800's suitcase design allows the unit to be rolled from place to place and includes a stowable handle as well as large wheels, making it ideal to bring power to places where options are scarce.\nThe Anker SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station raised over $5.8MM in crowdfunding, making it the most funded project in the Design & Tech category in 2023 on Kickstarter.com. The Anker SOLIX F3800 Portable Power Station will be available for retail purchase starting January 9 in the United States on Anker.com and Amazon for $3,999 with a special discount starting at $3,499. The Home Power Panel will be available later in Q1 2024.\nAnker SOLIX X1 Home Energy Solution\nThe Anker SOLIX X1 Home Energy Solution is a revolutionary addition to Anker's lineup of advanced home energy devices. Designed with precision engineering and cutting-edge technology, the X1 is set to redefine backup power for homes. Boasting a compact and modular design that seamlessly blends with any home decor, the X1 allows users to customize their system and provides flexible capacity from 5kWh to 180kWh and power from 3kW to 36kW. Users benefit from the ability to augment their system's capacity without compromising on energy efficiency by combining older and newer batteries. In the event of a battery pack malfunction, the system's auto-isolation feature ensures that charging can continue safely and its innovative energy optimization ensures each battery pack operates independently, boosting attainable energy by as much as to 5%.\nThe X1 provides extraordinary off-grid capabilities. If there's a risk of a power outage, users are protected with Auto Backup Mode recharging the battery. When an outage occurs, the Anker SOLIX X1 switches to backup power in under 20ms, providing a stable power supply by forming a micro-grid with the PV panels. InfiniPower(TM) provides great thermal performance, enabling the X1 to continuously supply power at 1.1\u00d7 the rated power output.\nThe X1 is also designed to operate under extreme conditions. It can charge and discharge without derating from -4degF to 131degF and has a NEMA Type 4 assembly ingress rating.\nThe Anker SOLIX X1 Home Energy Solution will be available later in 2024.\nThe Anker SOLIX Solarbank E1600, also selected as CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honorees, is designed for the European market to sit on a user's balcony, allowing consumers to maximize their solar power collection by storing electricity generated from solar panels.\nThe E1600, along with the newly released Anker SOLIX C1000 Portable Power Station, will also be showcased at the booth -- Hall Location, Tech West, Venetian Expo, Level 2 Zone A-D. Booth Number, 51255.\nAbout Anker SOLIX\nLeveraging Anker's leadership in battery storage and power delivery, Anker SOLIX is committed to developing power solutions that will bring energy independence to people all around the world.
