        "raw_content": "Nordic Semiconductor launches cellular IoT enhancements and demos low power Wi-Fi, Matter, LE Audio, and power management at CES 2024\nAt the \u2018most powerful tech event in the world\u2019 Nordic exhibits innovative solutions for the IoT including cellular IoT and DECT NR+, Apple and Google ecosystem coexistence within Matter, Wi-Fi locationing, asset tracking, Auracast, and Machine Learning\nNordic Semiconductor will bring its full portfolio of wireless IoT innovations to CES 2024 on booth 52323 at the Venetian Expo, including an update to its nRF91 Series cellular IoT solutions. Nordic will exhibit products for all the foundational technologies of the IoT including cellular IoT (NB-IoT and LTE-M), DECT NR+, low power Wi-Fi, Matter, and Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). The world\u2019s leading consumer electronics exhibition, CES is organized by the U.S.-based Consumer Technology Association (CTA) and will be held in Las Vegas, NV, from January 9 to 12, 2024.\nCES is the first event at which Nordic will introduce its nRF54H Series, the company\u2019s fourth generation with superior processing power, a generous amount of memory, and excellent efficiency. In benchmark testing, the nRF54H20 achieved twice the energy efficiency and performance of the second-best device in its category. The company will also launch significant hardware, software, and development tool updates to its nRF91 Series \u2013 further enhancing its end-to-end solutions for cellular IoT and DECT NR+.\nTogether with this end-to-end cellular IoT solution\u2014including silicon, software, development tools, Cloud services, and world-class technical support\u2014Nordic will also host key demonstrations on its booth, including its most comprehensive Matter demonstration to date. This Matter demonstration showcases Apple and Google ecosystem coexistence and includes devices from Eve Systems, Yale, Tridonic, and LEEDARSON. Meanwhile, an Asset tracking demonstration will show the Thingy:91 X, a prototyping platform that combines cellular IoT, GNSS, and Wi-Fi locationing.\nFurther demonstrations include Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast, a novel form of audio broadcasting. The demonstration will showcase the low power consumption and new features of this next generation of wireless audio. Nordic\u2019s LE Audio development hardware will be demonstrated working with current smartphones that support the technology. Elsewhere, there will also be a Machine Learning (ML) demo using the Thingy:53 IoT prototyping platform and software from Edge Impulse. Finally, the booth will host Nordic\u2019s nPM Power Management IC (PMIC) family, including the highly integrated nPM1300. The nPM1300 PMIC incorporates a range of system management features including a power efficient and highly accurate software-based fuel gauge.\nEstablished as the world's leading Bluetooth LE company, Nordic is now a wireless IoT company able to wirelessly \u201cconnect anything\u201d with low power wireless technologies such as Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, LTE-M, and NB-IoT. In addition to being a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance Board and a Promoter Member company, Nordic is a member of the ANT+ Alliance, Bluetooth SIG, Thread Group, Wi-Fi Alliance, and GSMA."
