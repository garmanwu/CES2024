Read more\u2026\nThe problem of fall injuries\nNote: Our wearable technology is in prototyping, and not yet available to the public.\nAn estimated three million people in the U.S. are rushed to hospitals each year due to devastating injuries from falls.1 Tens of thousands of these injuries result in life-changing consequences ranging from hip fractures to head injuries to death. At least 300,000 older people in the U.S. suffer hip fractures each year; more than 95% of these injuries are caused by falling. They are the #1 cause of traumatic brain injuries.2\nIn short, fall injuries are a $50 billion public health crisis.\nThe SAF-T VEST solution\nJay Davenport, M.D, a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon, designed a patented, wearable tech solution. It\u2019s called the SAF-T VEST\u2013a \u201csmart\u201d vest that will reduce the risk of serious injuries from falls.\nMost strategies to reduce injuries from falls focus on prevention. Dr. Davenport decided a different approach was needed: fall protection.\nTiny sensors will detect a fall in progress. Then, airbags inflate in less than a half-second to absorb the impact of the fall and reduce the risk of severe injury. The bags rapidly deflate to ensure a soft landing, like a deflating air mattress.\nThe airbag system is built into the vest, along with the sensors and a micro-computer. The vest will come in a variety colors, styles and thermal ratings for use in warm and moderate climates. We\u2019ll have versions for sleeping too.\nProof of concept\nAs seen in the video below, this prototype deploys only one airbag, which is designed to offer protection in a forward fall. Our fully- developed SAF-T VEST will feature a network of airbags providing fall injury protection from the hips to the head, no matter which direction the user falls. However, the prototype demonstrates the most important functions of the future version.\nAging well at home\nAccording to the American Association of Retired People (AARP), more than 90% of people aged 65 and over plan to stay in their homes as long as possible. So, what can we do to help extend our independent living? Experts say get up and get moving. The risks of falling increase as we age. Changes in vision, hearing and certain medications can affect balance. A bad fall can change a person\u2019s quality of life in an instant. Consequences include expensive medical care, long-term rehabilitation and a permanent loss of independence. Many begin a path of physical decline.\nHowever, regular exercise, including walking, can help reduce that risk. The SAF-T VEST lets you walk with confidence, providing the protection you need if you ever lose your balance.\nThe SAF-T VEST: a new idea using proven technology\nPersonal crash protection systems designed for high-speed sports like motorcycling and downhill skiing rely on similar components.This \u201csmart\u201d vest is a significant advance in fall protection. For decades, one of the few options was the AHIP protector\u2013a bulky undergarment with padding for the hips. The Tango Belt, made in France, is equipped with sensors and deploys one airbag over each hip, leaving other areas exposed to injury.\nAccording to AARP, more than 10,000 seniors turn 65 each day, a rate expected to continue into the 2030s. There are more than 53 million seniors in the U.S. Our target market includes clinicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities and seniors. Adult children of seniors represent an important secondary market."

A prototype of the SAF-T VEST deployed a full network of airbags in a backwards fall while fitted to a life-sized mannequin. Three dual-chambered airbags inflated in less than 0.4 seconds prior to impact with the floor. The airbags are designed to protect fracture prone areas of the body from the hips to the head. Testing planned for later this year will include adult volunteers.\nInvestors wanted\nThe company opened a $500K pre-seed round of funding to support advanced prototyping, pilot studies and commercial launch. As an early-stage start-up, the company raised $100,000 through crowdfunding and investments from friends and family. The capital fueled critical engineering advances in collaboration with Kablooe Design, the company\u2019s Minneapolis-based development partner. For more information or to receive investor materials, contact Ryan Davenport ([email\u00a0protected].)\nDavenport SAF-T Systems was selected to exhibit January 9th and 10th at CES by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES. The company was one of more than 1,200 start-ups on display at the Venetian Expo.\nPatented technology\nThe SAF-T VEST (U.S. Patent #10,897,938 B2), is a lightweight garment equipped with a motion sensor that can detect a person\u2019s fall in progress. The device inflates a network of airbags to protect the most fracture prone areas of the body, including the hips, back, upper extremities, and the head and neck. The airbags also rapidly deflate to absorb the impact. The SAF-T VEST is in development and not available for purchase.\nDavenport says the company continues to explore a variety of paths forward, including joint development opportunities and licensing agreements. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to bringing our solution to market because too many older adults are suffering terrible, life-threatening injuries from falling.\u201d The start-up, founded in 2017, was a semifinalist in the 2020 Most Fundable Companies survey. In 2022, the company received a Launch Minnesota Innovation Grant.\nAbout the SAF-T VEST\nEvery year millions of people fall, suffering life-changing consequences ranging from hip fractures to brain injuries to death. In 2020, more than 36,000 older adults died from falls. More than 300,000 people aged 65 and older are hospitalized each year due to hip fractures. Designed by Jay A. Davenport, M.D., a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon, the SAF-T VEST will help older adults maintain their independence\u2014so critical to quality of life. By reducing the risk and severity of injury, the user remains active and avoids the physical decline associated with a fall injury. While it may be impossible to ever prevent 100% of falls from occurring, the technology to reduce the severity of injury from falls is now within reach.\nPost navigation\n2 thoughts on \u201cDavenport SAF-T Systems draws a crowd at CES \u201824, opens pre-seed funding round\u201d\nMust have\nI have small money, very small, I could contribute.\nHi Liza,\nThank you for your interest in the SAF-T VEST!

Then the mannequin was gently pushed, causing it to fall forward. The onboard motion sensors quickly detected a fall, which triggered inflation of its new multi-airbag system. The inflation took just 0.2 seconds. As the mannequin hit the floor, the airbags deflated to absorb the impact.\n\u201cThis is a major milestone for our start-up,\u201d said Ryan Davenport. We\u2019re seeing the future of fall injury protection.\u201d\nDavenport said the company\u2019s engineering partners are now evaluating the results of the demonstration, with an eye toward improving airbag protection in certain areas, including the face, head and neck. A second fall test is planned in the next 1-2 weeks. Future modifications and enhancements will transform the look of the prototype into a fashion-friendly article of clothing with fall protection capabilities.\nCrowdfunding winds down\nThe breakthrough comes as the start-up\u2019s crowdfunding campaign comes to a close at 11:59 p.m. ET today.\n\u201cFor those who\u2019ve been waiting to see more progress before investing\u2013the wait is over,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cThere\u2019s still time to join more than 95 investors who have decided to help us make fall injury protection a reality.\u201d\nThe start-up has not yet reached it\u2019s maximum goal of $124,000 and Davenport says closing the gap is critically important to maintaining momentum.\n\u201cWe take our mission seriously. Every second of every hour in the U.S. an older adults suffers a fall. Half of all nursing home residents fall each year. Up to a million hospital patients suffer falls. Across the nation, more than one in four seniors falls each year about 14 million people.\u201d\nA track record of progress\nThis latest milestone follows a string of accomplishments for the Minneapolis-based start-up. The company developed it\u2019s first working prototype in collaboration with college seniors at the School of Engineering at University of St. Thomas. In January 2021, SAF-T VEST inventor and orthopedic surgeon Jay A. Davenport, M.D., received a U.S. Patent for his design.

Extend independence for seniors\nTHE PROBLEM\nWe all know someone\u2015maybe an aging parent or relative, or perhaps an elderly neighbor\u2015who suffered a terrible fall.\u00a0 Sadly, falls among older adults are not rare events. One in four seniors in the U.S.\u00a0falls each year. That's about 14 million people falling down.\nFor older adults, a fall can have life-changing, even life-threatening consequences. Fall injuries are a $50 billion problem in the U.S. and it's getting worse each year.\nJay A. Davenport, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon, decided fall prevention strategies were not solving the problem.\u00a0 So he developed a new strategy: wearable fall protection. The SAF-T VEST.\nThe SAF-T VEST uses sensors to detect a fall in progress. It will inflate a system of airbags in the blink of an eye\u00a0to reduce the risk of injury\u2015from the hips to the head. It will be reusable and come in a variety of sizes and styles. Wear it over your regular clothes or pajamas.\nRemember, this is a safety product\u2015not a\u00a0medical device. Think of it as a life preserver on land!\nWorried about a fall?\u00a0Many seniors limit their activities after a bad fall\u00a0because of fears it could happen again. But not moving can make you more vulnerable to falls. Wearing the\u00a0SAF-T VEST could provide the reassurance you need. Otherwise,\u00a0that fear could\u00a0require major life changes.

It is also applying for development grants from allied industries and government research agencies. The money will be used to build on the work of the St. Thomas engineers to create an advanced prototype suitable for human studies and rigorous testing. The company is also collaborating with a noted expert in fall detection from the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nAbout Davenport SAF-T Systems\nDavenport SAF-T Systems is developing the SAF-T VEST (U.S. Patent No.10,897,938), a wearable \u201csmart\u201d vest designed to reduce the risk of injury in falls. Injuries suffered from falls are a public health crisis. In 2015, the direct medical cost of fall injuries in the U.S. topped $50 billion.The SAF-T VEST was invented by Company founder Jay A. Davenport, M.D., a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon. It\u2019s equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the user\u2019s center of balance. When an unrecoverable fall is detected, a microprocessor triggers a network of airbags to inflate in a fraction of a second, absorbing the impact of the fall and deflating rapidly for a soft landing. The airbags protect the pelvis, hips, upper extremities and head.\nRecent news\nSee what's happening in Medical Alley.\nNewronika Sercures Initial \u20ac2 Million in Blended Finance from EIC Accelerator for Groundbreaking Parkinson\u2019s Disease Research\nIn the Know: Healthcare News for January 22, 2024\nMinnetronix Medical to Headline\u00a02024 Electronics Engineering Show\nStay informed with the Medical Alley newsletter\nReady to be at the epicenter of health innovation?\n\u00a9 2024 Medical Alley Association.

They solve problems. And they question everything.\nHow it all began\nLooking back, I realize the whole idea for the SAF-T VEST began as a question. As an orthopaedic surgeon, Jay Davenport took care of hundreds, maybe thousands of older adults injured in falls.\nWhat kind of injuries?\nBroken hips, head injuries, wrist, elbow and shoulder fractures. There were neck and back injuries, too. My father relied on his training and his problem-solving skills to help people recover. He didn\u2019t worry about falling. He worried about the people who fell.\nLater, well into retirement, he began to think about what could happen if he ever had a bad fall. Living in a rural area means it might be 20 minutes or more for an ambulance to arrive. Who would look after Martha (my mother) if he were hospitalized? Jay put his thoughts on paper. He questioned everything. If fall risks increase as we age, how can we reduce the consequences of falling? In other words, instead of trying to prevent falls\u2013which is not realistic\u2013why not build something that will protect you if you do?\nThat\u2019s when he began to sketch an idea for a wearable solution. He and I called it the\u00a0SAF-T VEST.\nKablooe engineers are expert problem solvers. They studied Jay\u2019s idea, his sketches and our U.S. Patent. They reviewed brilliant proof of concept work performed by\u00a0engineers at University of St. Thomas\u00a0(St. Paul, Minn.).\nMaking it work\nThe SAF-T VEST is wearable technology that will detect the user\u2019s fall in progress and almost instantly inflate a system of airbags. When the person collides with the floor, some of the air is forced out of the airbags, absorbing the impact of the fall from the hips to the head. Sounds simple, right?\nWrong.\nEngineering questions\nHow much air is required to fill the entire network of airbags? What about making the device reusable? Is the motion sensor too sensitive? What if the person falls backward? Forward? How fast do the airbags need to inflate? What is Newton\u2019s Ideal Gas Law? How will the motion sensor know the difference between sitting down and falling? Why do we need an algorithm?\nNotes from the workshop\nThis week engineers are using computer aided design (CAD) to develop airbag mockups then putting them on \u201cManny,\u201d our SAF-T VEST mannequin.\nSoftware coding continues, along with motion sensor testing, and calculations to determine the best airbag volumes. We\u2019ve discussed how Jay\u2019s airbag design provides protection to areas of the body considered most prone to fracture in a fall.\nWe also considered the question of how much air needs to escape upon impact to decelerate and absorb the impact of the fall. This is what problem solving looks like.\nI, of course, have nothing but questions.\nPost navigation"

Why? Because we\u2019re developing innovative, wearable tech\u2014the SAF-T VEST\u2122\u2014to reduce devastating injuries from falls.\nInjuries from falls, especially among older adults, are a $50B public health crisis. More than one in four older adults falls each year in the U.S.* And the problem is only getting worse. Over the past 20 years, the death rate from falls in the U.S. has more than doubled.**\nWe achieved enough critical support to get our raise off the ground and build momentum to achieve our mission.\nToday we\u2019re proud to announce our round of funding is open to the public! It means anyone can invest in\u00a0the SAF-T VEST\u2014for a minimum of $100!\nWant to know about our traction? In less than two years we\u2019ve already:\nWe\u2019re proud of our progress. But we\u2019re not finished yet. Together with our engineering partners at Kablooe Design, we\u2019re getting ready to build an advanced SAF-T VEST prototype. This next gen technology will be designed to provide 360-degree fall injury protection from the hips to the head. Then our lead scientific advisor, Tanvi Bhatt, Ph.D., will test the SAF-T VEST while being worn\nby healthy volunteers at her lab at the University of Illinois Chicago.\nBy making an investment in Davenport SAF-T Systems, you\u2019ll have a stake in our success AND help speed our progress.

Jay A. Davenport, M.D, a board-certified orthopaedic surgeon, designed the SAF-T VEST to provide 360-degree fall injury protection. The SAF-T VEST is equipped with sensors that continuously monitor the user\u2019s center of gravity. When an unrecoverable fall is detected, a microprocessor will trigger a network of airbags to inflate in a fraction of a second, absorbing the impact of the fall and deflating rapidly for a soft, cushioned landing. The airbags protect the pelvis, hips, upper extremities neck and head. The SAF-T VEST: Walk with Confidence. Learn more at davenportsaftsystems.com.\nPost navigation"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

One that caught ZDNET's resident robot vacuum expert's eye is the Dreame X30 robot vacuum and mop. This robot vacuum features an anti-tangle feature that cuts any hair that may be tangled in the brush rollers.\n\"The cutting heads are carefully positioned to do this, carefully tucking away the heads to ensure that your floors and carpets aren't scratched as the robot moves along,\" according to ZDNET's Beth Mauder.\nAside from this feature, the Dreame X30 features 8000Pa of suction power, dual oscillating mop heads, and automatic carpet detection to lift its mop pads up to 10.5mm. It's available for preorder at the early bird special of $1,240, down from its $1,700 retail price.\nHonorable mentions\nOther brands like Roborock and Ecovacs also launched new products at CES 2024. Roborock launched a new S8 Max series of robot vacuums and mops available in April 2024, including S8 MaxV Ultra and S8 Max Ultra, both of which will feature an alternative refill and drainage system that connects to a home's water supply.\nEcovacs also announced a new variant of the Deebot X2 Omni, the Deebot X2 Combo, available at the end of March for $1,599. This variant makes the Omni station, where the robot vacuum docks to empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, also function as a charging dock for a new Ecovacs handheld stick vacuum.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\nBest energy management solutions\nEcoFlow stole the home energy spotlight at CES 2024 with the launch of its largest portable battery to date, the Delta Pro Ultra. Combined with an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2, the DPU inverter and battery combination can also serve as a home backup system that can be charged with AC, solar, or gas generators.\nThe introductory price of $4,999 buys the Delta Pro Ultra with 6kWh capacity, and users can stack up to five batteries under each inverter, combining up to three inverters with one Smart Home Panel for a total of 90kWh.\nHonorable mentions\nImpressive features aside, EcoFlow isn't the only company showcasing energy solutions at CES.

Lockly launched a new residential smart lock that supports facial recognition technology, the Lockly Visage.\nThis is even more convenient than using a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key to unlock your door -- \u00a0but don't worry, the Lockly Visage also supports both of those options for unlocking. And if you're still feeling old school, you can also unlock it with a keypad or physical key.\nThis Matter-enabled smart lock will be available this summer for $349.\nHonorable mentions\nSmart home brand Abode also launched a new Wi-Fi HaLow camera with an ultra-long transmission range of over 1.5 miles.

Known as the Ashburn Data Center, this property, comprising 132,285 square feet of net rentable area and a 9-megawatt critical IT load, was sold by Starwood Capital to GI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle for $150 million.\nThe data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, situated within Digital Realty\u2019s Northern Virginia campus, hosts major tenants such as Oracle and Morgan Stanley, contributing to NOI of $10.9 million. GI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle is securing a $60 million CMBS loan against the data center.\nIn the following sections, Dgtl Infra delves deeper into key aspects of 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, including detailed lease agreements with Oracle and Morgan Stanley, the specifics of the mortgage loan associated with the property, and the complex history of the data center. Additionally, we provide an overview of the Northern Virginia data center market, offering a broader context to the strategic importance of this location.\nTable of Contents\nData Center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, Ashburn, Virginia\nThe data center located at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive in Ashburn, Loudoun County, Virginia, is held in fee simple. It is situated on an 8.2-acre parcel of land and is part of Digital Realty\u2019s larger 98-acre data center campus, which is in proximity to Washington, D.C., and Dulles International Airport. This data center is located adjacent to \u201cData Center Alley\u201d, a renowned area within the Northern Virginia data center market.\nThe net rentable area of the data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive is 132,285 square feet, out of which 67,500 square feet is raised floor area. It has a critical IT load of 9 megawatts in a 2N / N+1 redundancy configuration, ensuring that the facility\u2019s systems remain operational even in the event of a component failure.\nConstructed in 2010, this 13-year-old data center has underwritten revenues of $14.6 million and underwritten net operating income (NOI) of $10.9 million. The property was recently appraised at $150 million, equal to the purchase price paid for the data center by GI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle. In terms of valuation, the data center is appraised at $1,134 per square foot, $16.7 million per megawatt, and yields a return of 7.24% on the property\u2019s underwritten NOI.\nThe data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive in Ashburn, Virginia, is fully occupied. It is leased to two major tenants, Oracle and Morgan Stanley, with a weighted average remaining lease term (WALT) of 6.3 years, calculated based on the underwritten base rent. However, as discussed below, the remaining lease terms for each tenant vary significantly.\nOracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL), the data center\u2019s primary tenant, occupies 91,809 square feet and 6.75 megawatts, or 75% of the facility\u2019s critical IT load. The company pays $9.47 million in rent (straight-lined), which constitutes 62.1% of the underwritten base rent, implying pricing of $103.11 per square foot. Of Oracle\u2019s leased area, 89,042 square feet are designated as data hall space, rented at $96.50 per kilowatt (kW) per month.\nOracle\u2019s lease has annual escalations based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), albeit with a minimum increase (floor) of 2% and a cap of 5%. Consequently, the underwritten base rent, which represents the straight-lined rent throughout Oracle\u2019s lease term, is $115.84 per kW per month for the data hall space.\nOracle\u2019s lease, which does not include any termination options, extends until August 31, 2032, providing the company with a remaining term of over 9 years.\nREAD MORE: Oracle Cloud\u2019s Data Center Locations\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), the data center\u2019s second key tenant, occupies 38,715 square feet and 2.25 megawatts, accounting for 25% of the facility\u2019s critical IT load. The company pays $5.66 million in rent (straight-lined), which constitutes 37.1% of the underwritten base rent, implying a pricing of $146.12 per square foot. Of Morgan Stanley\u2019s leased area, 29,043 square feet are utilized as data hall space, rented at $193.18 per kilowatt (kW) per month.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s lease has annual escalations of 3%. Accordingly, the underwritten base rent, which represents the straight-lined rent throughout Morgan Stanley\u2019s lease term, is $202.24 per kW per month for the data hall space. Notably, Morgan Stanley\u2019s data hall rent is materially higher than Oracle\u2019s, in-part, due to its superior 2N configuration, which offers better redundancy protection compared to Oracle\u2019s N+1 configuration.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s 2N configuration for data center redundancy involves having two completely independent sets of infrastructure, like power supplies and cooling systems, each capable of fully supporting all operations. On the other hand, Oracle\u2019s N+1 configuration has a primary set of infrastructure capable of supporting all operations, with one additional unit for redundancy.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s lease, which does not include any termination options, extends only until March 31, 2025, leaving the company with a remaining lease term of just 1.8 years. Since 2010, Morgan Stanley has been a tenant at the data center and previously amended its lease in 2014 with a 10-year extension through 2025. The company has one, 5-year renewal option remaining.\nThe data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive is critical for Morgan Stanley as it powers the company\u2019s sales and trading platforms for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Asian Markets via servers on-site at the data center. Given the significant investment and the resulting high stakes, a service interruption from Morgan Stanley\u2019s servers going offline would have severe consequences.\nThe data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive has other minor tenants, including four telecom companies that collectively contribute $115,479, or 0.8% of the rent. Digital Realty, the property manager, also utilizes 1,756 square feet of the facility for storage and office space.\nMortgage Loan on 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, Ashburn, Virginia\nGI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle, operating under the entity GI TC Devin Shafron, LLC, is the borrower of a $60 million commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) loan. This loan will be used to replace the fund\u2019s existing acquisition financing for the data center located at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive in Ashburn, Virginia.\nGiven the data center\u2019s purchase price of $150 million, this principal loan balance represents a 40% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on the property. The loan, which does not include any amortization, is an interest-only loan with an annual interest rate of 5.95%. The loan\u2019s maturity date is set for June 6, 2033, signifying a 10-year term. Additionally, the loan is backed by sponsor equity of $91 million, which has been invested in the property.\nThe sponsor, GI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle, operates through the entity TechCore, LLC. This core real estate fund was established in 2012 by GI Partners and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS). The fund specializes in investing in technology-advantaged properties across the United States, with a particular emphasis on data centers. These investments include properties such as:\nAs of December 2022, TechCore boasted a net worth of approximately $2.1 billion and liquidity of around $37.5 million. Since its inception, the fund has invested in over 3.6 million square feet of stabilized, core technology-advantaged real estate, acquiring a total of 19 properties.\nHistory of 43915 Devin Shafron Drive, Ashburn, Virginia\nThe data center located at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive in Ashburn, Virginia, has a complex financial history. It initially faced difficulties when a significant loan that its prior owners secured went into default. This was attributed to a major tenant, a social media company, deciding not to renew its lease in 2020. Consequently, the original lender decided to offload the financial obligation by selling the note to Starwood Capital for a sum of approximately $68.0 million.\nStarwood Capital proceeded to foreclose on the property in April 2021. At that time, the data center\u2019s equity owner was an 80%/20% joint venture known as Digital-GCEAR 1 (Ashburn), formed between Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT (GCEAR) and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR). Subsequently, Starwood Capital assumed equity ownership of the property.\nEventually, in 2022, the aforementioned social media company vacated the property, leaving a significant void. However, Starwood Capital managed to secure a 10-year lease of this vacant space to Oracle, who subsequently became the largest tenant at the property.\nThis leasing deal significantly enhanced the value of the once distressed property. As a result, Starwood Capital was able to sell the data center to GI Partners\u2019 TechCore investment vehicle for $150 million. At the time, Digital Realty was a minority investor as well as the property manager and leasing agent for the data center.\nNorthern Virginia \u2013 Data Center Market Overview\nThe data center at 43915 Devin Shafron Drive is located in Ashburn, Loudoun County, Virginia, approximately 30 miles from Washington D.C., and roughly 7 miles from Dulles International Airport. Loudoun County is home to more than 25 million square feet of data centers and hosts over 3,500 technology companies, resulting in it having the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers. Approximately 70% of the entire world\u2019s internet traffic flows through the Northern Virginia data center market on a daily basis.\nIn the last decade alone, nearly $12 billion has been invested in Virginia\u2019s information technology (IT) sector, creating more than 3,000 data center jobs and 10,000 support positions in Loudoun County. Absorption in the market has increased from 90 megawatts of capacity in 2016 to over 700 megawatts in 2022.\nIn aggregate, the Northern Virginia data center market has more than 2,900 megawatts of commissioned power and an impressively low vacancy rate of approximately 1%. As of 2022, there is over 5 million square feet under active construction in the market, and it\u2019s projected that 800 megawatts of critical IT capacity will be completed by 2024.\nKey drivers of future growth in Northern Virginia\u2019s data center market include low power rates, affordable land, tax incentives specific to data centers, and proximity to a primary internet exchange connectivity point.\nREAD MORE: Virginia Data Centers \u2013 Ashburn, Loudoun, and Beyond\nUnderwater Data Centers: Servers Beneath the Surface\nData Center Water Usage: A Comprehensive Guide\nTop 250 Data Center Companies in the World as of 2024\nTop 10 Cloud Service Providers Globally in 2024\nData Center Tiers: What\u2019s the Difference Between 1, 2, 3, and 4?\nData Center Operations: A Comprehensive Guide for Operators\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nCell Tower Range: How Far Do They Reach?\nCell Tower Lease (Rates, Agreements, Buyout, Value)\nHow Much Does it Cost to Build a Cell Tower?\nCell Tower Locations: How to Find 4G LTE and 5G Towers\nTop 100 Cellular Towers Companies in the World as of 2024\nUnderwater Data Centers: Servers Beneath the Surface\nData Center Water Usage: A Comprehensive Guide\nTop 250 Data Center Companies in the World as of 2024\nTop 10 Cloud Service Providers Globally in 2024\nData Center Tiers: What\u2019s the Difference Between 1, 2, 3, and\u2026\nSubsea Cables: The Invisible Fiber Link Enabling the Internet\nBackhaul Networks: Wired vs Wireless, Fiber vs Ethernet\nXGS-PON: Fiber Optic Technology Delivering 10 Gbps\nFiber to the Home (FTTH): A Comprehensive Guide\nFiber Optic Network Construction: Process and Build Costs\nTop 100 Telecom Companies in the World as of 2024\nInternet of Things (IoT) Examples by Industry in 2024\nInternet of Things (IoT) Devices: What\u2019s Smart in 2024?\nNext-Generation Fixed Wireless Access (ngFWA): Bridging the Digital Divide\n5G Frequency Bands and Spectrum Explained: Low, Mid, High"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?
