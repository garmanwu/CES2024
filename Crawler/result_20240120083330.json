Hello, please introduce yourself first. Hello, I am Lee Min-seo, a second-year student in the Department of Global Business Administration. At first, I was worried about whether I would be able to adapt well to my major classes because I entered the regular high school through regular admission and had no experience living abroad, but I am trying hard to catch up. After enrolling, I tried to experience various activities, and am currently preparing for my final activity in \u2018Steroids\u2019, the band club of the Department of Global Business Administration. 2. I heard that you have been selected as a Jungbong Alumni Scholarship student for the 2023 school year. Please briefly share your thoughts on receiving the award. Thank you for the great opportunity. As I become a second grader, I wanted to learn a lot academically, and I applied for the Jungbong Alumni Scholarship. Through the scholarship, I will be able to grow and develop on my own. Thank you again. 3. You are also a scholarship recipient with excellent academic records. Do you have your own secret? Since the evaluation method is different for each subject, I think it is important to look at the evaluation method carefully and study accordingly. It is important to look at the syllabus and lecture reviews before registering for a course and then choose a course that suits you well, so I recommend that you read the lecture reviews carefully before registering for a course. It is a good idea to take notes as much as possible during class. If your writing speed is slow, you can use a laptop to write down and organize them later. 4. Are there any activities on or off campus that you're currently working on? If you have any activities that you remember the most, please introduce them to us. Currently, I am working as an SME digital marketing supporter on campus hosted by Naver. This is a project to run search advertisements through Biz Money in cooperation with small business owners. I am actively participating in online marketing activities using the Naver platform as much as possible, such as registering search ads and creating short forms with my team members. It is not easy to grasp the direct marketing effect, but I think the advantage is that I can learn about Naver's search advertising system and do digital marketing myself. Last year, as a member of the school's management society, we conducted four rounds of industry-academia cooperation and various activities related to business issues. By working on a team project with other academic members, I was able to learn about various issues related to business administration and practical work through meeting with working staff. 5. What are your future career paths and goals? I haven't decided on a clear course yet. Previously, I was interested in marketing and mainly engaged in related activities, but I plan to learn more about accounting during the summer vacation. 6. Lastly, please say something to the students at the business school. I think there are some people who have a clear plan for their career path, and there are also people like me who feel vague anxiety because they do not have a clear goal yet. However, if you experience as diverse as possible, I think you will be able to find your aptitude soon. I hope everyone leaves pleasant memories at Sungkyunkwan University.
