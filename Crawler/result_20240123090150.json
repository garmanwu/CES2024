        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

I\u2019ve lost count of how many times I dropped a smartphone where the frames were chipped and the screens were cracked beyond repair.\nI\u2019ve held on tight to my impact-resistant cases to protect my fragile slates. Even though my paranoia is still in check, the truth is smartphones nowadays are as durable as ever.\nTaking things up a notch, global smartphone brand Honor dropped (pun not intended) its toughest smartphone to date \u2014 the Honor X9b 5G. The all-around durability is enticing, but is strength the only thing that it can offer?\nToughness is in its DNA\nThe Honor X9b 5G (X9b for brevity) is far from any tough-looking smartphone you\u2019d expect when they say it\u2019s incredibly durable. I had the Sunrise Orange colorway, in its most striking vegan leather rear panel.\nStill not a fan of it, but it feels like caressing an expensive planner/journal like the ones from 2024 Starbucks Traditions.\nThe other colorways \u2014 Midnight Black, Emerald Green, and Titanium Silver \u2014 didn\u2019t come in Vegan Leather and used glass panels instead. Fret not, the \u201ctough-on-all-angle\u201d memo can be seen across social media regardless of the colors you choose.\nAfter all, the X9b uses an ultra-bounce anti-drop design. We\u2019ve tested it on concrete, tiles, and other hard surfaces multiple times. I even played hopscotch using the X9b as a toss.\nIt was a little bit scary to test its durability, but I had a good time playing with it. Knowing that your smartphone can handle a few tosses unscathed from having it thrown gives you peace of mind.\nSide note: This smartphone would be a godsend to parents whose kids throw anything they get their hands on.\nLast year, I recommended the Honor X9a 5G to a mom friend, and her smartphone\u2019s still working fine. With an even better durability, what\u2019s there to be afraid of? Toddlers can\u2019t destroy this slate easily.\nBuilt for daily walks (and runs?)\nThe X9b, weighing at 185g, can be quite hefty to some. I\u2019d say it\u2019s on the heavier side for those with frail arms and bad grip, but how can you drop it easily when it has a curved display?\nIt\u2019s ergonomically designed to keep your grip on it and carry it around. And even if you drop it, it\u2019s strong enough to endure any beating.\nNevertheless, I walked around the Fort and even ran up the slopes of the suburbs to look at some picturesque views. The circular camera island has struck me with its watch-inspired design, piquing my curiosity about how great its cameras could be.\nSnap-worthy captures (or not?)\nThe X9b comes with a triple camera system, having the 108-megapixel main camera as the showstopper. It\u2019s complemented by a 5-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a 2-megapixel macro sensor.\nUp front, its punch-hole houses a 16-megapixel selfie shooter.\nFrom hereon, it\u2019s a collection of everyday life and scenes I stared at for a long time, all captured using the X9b\u2019s different camera modes.\nIt\u2019s just as good as its back\nWe spend a lot of time staring at our screens. At this point, it\u2019s a crime to put lackluster efforts towards the display.\nThe 6.78-inch AMOLED screen of the X9b comes with sharp and vivid pictures. It\u2019s complemented by a 120Hz refresh rate for those who want it seamless and snappy.\nI personally don\u2019t care anymore since I just end up doom-scrolling on TikTok and Instagram Reels. The high refresh rate is still suited to those who play games.\nBut the huge screen isn\u2019t just for endless scrolling and playing games. I used it to catch up with my newest obsession, King the Land (\ud0b9\ub354\ub79c\ub4dc), which I watched on Netflix.\nUnfortunately, its peak brightness reaches up to 1200 nits only. It isn\u2019t particularly reliable when using it outdoors, and I had a challenging time watching anything beside a caf\u00e9\u2019s glass window.\nIt could be brighter, but it\u2019s bearable. Unless you\u2019ve experienced using smartphones with insane brightness levels, the X9b will do well. Otherwise, it\u2019s perfectly suited for lounging around indoors.\nSurvivor through the day\nThe HONOR X9b 5G is as midrange as it gets. Sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, I was able to switch between apps smoothly. I didn\u2019t experience the occasional lags I usually encounter when using a midrange device.\nThe 12GB RAM working in tandem with the 256GB storage, along with the Adreno A710 graphics contributed to letting me play Mobile Legends: Bang Bang seamlessly.\nMy only gripe was when switching between camera modes, commonly evident in alternating between Photo, Video, and Portrait. It takes a while to switch to a certain mode. This is extremely crucial when you don\u2019t want to miss a moment of what\u2019s happening in front of you.\nI\u2019m uncertain whether this can be fixed with a software update or if it\u2019s the chipset in play. Otherwise, it\u2019s a dealbreaker for those who use the camera app a lot.\nBut in terms of surviving a day\u2019s worth of content, social media browsing, and non-stop Internet connectivity, the X9b packs a punch.\nThe 5800mAh battery capacity lasted me a whole day without reaching for a power bank. I was out and about having brunch, did an afternoon gym session, and had a Friday night out with friends.\nWhen the weekend came, I was lounging at home which meant not using my phone as much. The battery even lasted until Monday before I felt the need to recharge it, which is still fast enough since it reaches up to 35W of wired charging.\nIs this your GadgetMatch?\nThe HONOR X9b 5G is tough. It\u2019s true to its claim that it can handle the impact of accidentally dropping it on various surfaces.\nWhile strength and durability are its key selling points, it doesn\u2019t shy away from giving you a decent experience worthy of its price.\nThe X9b sports a vivid display, is equipped with long-lasting battery life, and provides enough power to keep you going through the day. The cameras are also decent enough, but not stellar enough to give that wow factor for the price it commands.\nIn a way, the X9b is an excellent all-arounder that has the advantage of being strong enough to handle drops and smashes. Especially when you compare it to its competitors in its price range and even its predecessor, the HONOR X9a 5G.\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a smartphone that can survive your day-to-day and won\u2019t likely give up and break on you, the HONOR X9b 5G might just be your GadgetMatch. Who knows? You might be the one to break first (or your heart) before this device gets broken.\nThe HONOR X9b 5G retails for PhP 16,999. It\u2019s available in retail stores, as well as Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop.\nHONOR announces Magic V2 RSR, Magic6 series\nHONOR X9b 5G: Price, availability in the Philippines\nHONOR launches MagicOS 8.0 with \u2018intent-based\u2019 UI\nAccessories\nWhy the SteelSeries Alias Pro is a steal\nPerfect for streamers, voice actors and podcasters\nPublished\non\nBy\nI have to say, I am completely new to XLR microphones. I dabbled in podcasting, directed voice overs, and streamed games to friends\u2026 all while using USB microphones. Aside from the price range, USB microphones are easier to set-up. Plus, they are more portable.\nOne of my multi-hyphenated friends, who loves streaming on Twitch and recording voice overs for content, introduced me to XLR microphones. I was at his place one time for a content shoot when I used his gaming set-up.\nI played Genshin Impact on his PC and streamed it for fun while catching up with some of my friends on Discord. My friends quickly noticed my improved audio compared to the usual.\nI also tried doing audio samples for some of my projects using my friend\u2019s microphone, and I loved the sound quality. He lured me into purchasing one, and he explained the benefits of investing in a high-end XLR microphone with the words: \u201cwhen you experience it, there is no turning back.\u201d\nTo be quite honest, I was unbelievably convinced to make the switch.\nFor a time, I was checking out XLR microphones in tech stores to check the perfect fit for me. I\u2019ve seen some mics with such complicated set-ups, and I am not a fan of those. I just need a quality one.\nThankfully, I met the guys from SteelSeries at last year\u2019s Electronic Sports and Gaming Summit, and they offered me their latest audio rig \u2014 the Alias Pro.\nSteelSeries has a reputation in the gaming community so I was ecstatic to have my first-ever device from the brand. Most of my friends own Steelseries headsets and they\u2019re pretty satisfied.\nTheir product prices are quite reasonable, although I think the Steelseries Alias Pro is really on the hefty side.\nClassy and high quality design\nThe thing about the Steelseries Alias Pro is that it\u2019s not just any XLR microphone. Upon opening the big orange box, I immediately saw the two main components: the mixer and, of course, the mic with stand. It looks uncomplicated compared to the others I\u2019ve seen, so it\u2019s a plus for me as someone who lacks patience with setting-up my devices.\nWhile unboxing the whole thing, it\u2019s noticeable that the Steelseries Alias Pro is made of high quality material. The microphone itself looks premium and elegant with its black matte body which would neatly blend in a black PC set-up. I know a lot of friends who would dig this aesthetic.\nHowever, I am a fan of mics with RGB lights, so this one looks quite boring to my liking. The mixer has RGB lights, though, so that may be a compromise.\nSeamless set-up\nSince I am used to USB microphones, it took a while for me to figure out the set-up.\nThankfully, the instructions aren\u2019t hard to follow and Steelseries has lots of resources \u2013from the manual to online video guides.\nThe mixer has no fuss and just easy to use. There\u2019s a gain knob on the left which gives a green light signal when the pick-up audio is good, then it changes from to red when the pick-up is bad.\nOn the right is the volume knob. I liked that it has a bigger size than the gain knob because when I\u2019m in-game, I know which is which even if my eyes are glued to the screen.\nBelow the knobs are two buttons: one for muting and unmuting the mic, and the other is for the speakers.\nFor the ports, the Steelseries Alias Pro has two USB-C ports at the back of the mixer for connecting to up to two PCs (helpful for those with a two PC set-up).\nThe main con with having XLR microphones \u2013 and probably the reason why most people hesitate to switch \u2013 is the complicated set-up. But honestly, the Steelseries Alias Pro is easy to install.\nA streamer\u2019s dream\nAfter a few weeks of using this device, I really feel that it\u2019s a good steal for hardcore streamers and gamers.\nThe audio output is very crisp and clear, and the bass sounds are good. I am biased to devices that puts emphasis on bass sounds.\nThe Steelseries Alias Pro comes with Sonar, a free software which allows users to easily customize their audio experience with presets for the most popular games today.\nWhether you\u2019re playing Valorant or League of Legends, Sonar has different presets tailored-fit to the requirements of each game. You can also create your own depending on your preferred settings.\nStreamers can easily adjust their game audio so the background music won\u2019t overpower their voice. This is especially useful when you\u2019re talking to co-players in-game. Of course, it would be a pleasant watch to your viewers as well.\nOne of my favorite features is the spatial audio, which gives an effect that is similar to a surround sound. This is also customizable via Sonar, so you can control the distance or the loudness of sound depending to your liking for every game.\nSonar also has tools for mixing sounds for several audio inputs and remixing them in one audio output. This is good because there is no need to run/install OBS \u2014 Sonar can do it for you.\nI did a test stream on both Discord and Facebook, and it works well. My friend, who convinced me to switch to XLR, was very impressed with the audio output as well.\nThe Sonar software also features Clearcast AI noise cancellation, which brings more focus to the speaking voice. This is a very helpful feature in omitting extra unnecessary noises (e.g electric fan sounds, motorcycle riders from afar).\nBelow is a raw audio record with enabled Clearcast AI noise cancellation:\nOn the other hand, here is a sample audio when I disabled this feature:\nI find this feature very useful for recording audios I need for my corporate work, since I don\u2019t need to use another app to clean the background noise.\nHowever, there are instances that I don\u2019t quite like it, but of course this is subjective. For example, I still want to hear the sound of my keyboard while playing a game. The Clearcast AI somehow omits the sound of mechanical keyboards, so I turn this feature off sometimes.\nBonus feature: ASMR recording\nI love consuming ASMR content, so now that I\u2019ve upgraded my microphone, I sometimes create some ASMR audios for fun. I do it when I\u2019m bored, or when I\u2019d just want to flex how good my new mic is to my friends.\nThe sound is rich and very detailed, so I figured Alias Pro is also something voice actors would want to use. However, remember to turn off the Clearcast AI noise cancellation when recording an ASMR, because it omits \u201cwhisper\u201d sounds.\nIs this your GadgetMatch?\nWhile the device is quite pricey, it\u2019s a great investment for streamers, especially those with additional hobbies and careers that require high-definition audio.\nFor casual gamers and the general public, though, I honestly think the Alias USB microphone would suffice. But if you have more cash to shell out, then why not.\nI also recommend the Alias Pro to professional voice actors, since the additional features (especially the noise cancellation and Sonar software) would help reduce editing time. The voice quality is topnotch,\nThe Steelseries Alias Pro XLR microphone retails for PhP 19,555, while the Alias USB microphone costs Php 11,000.\nReviews\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown review: A time-travelling Metroidvania\nIt\u2019s back to 2.5D basics\nPublished\non\nBy\nIn late 2007, Ubisoft released the first Assassin\u2019s Creed, jumpstarting a franchise that would span fifteen years and counting. However, the time-trotting series didn\u2019t start off as strong as it is now. Its humble beginnings actually stem from a lesser-known franchise in Ubisoft\u2019s oeuvre: Prince of Persia. The original Assassin\u2019s Creed was supposed to be a sequel to the series. Now, fifteen years later, Ubisoft is back with a new Prince of Persia title: The Lost Crown.\nBack to Persia\nEssentially a spiritual reboot to the series, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown does not feature the original Prince of the Sands of Time trilogy. Rather, it features a talented warrior among the Persian Immortals, Sargon. Much like other entries in the franchise, The Lost Crown features mystical elements in Persian mythology.\nAfter successfully repelling an invading force against Persia, the Immortals face a new threat: The Prince has been kidnapped by one of their own and taken to the magical Mount Qaf. In Mount Qaf, nothing is ever as they seem. Timelines and possibilities bleed into one another. And, more than a battle of swords and scimitars, the game revels in platforming aided by magic.\nHowever, unlike its predecessors, The Lost Crown thrives as a 2D platformer, rather than a 3D action-adventure game. It\u2019s a new experience that\u2019s still worthy of the Prince of Persia name.\nA true Metroidvania experience\n\u201cTalented\u201d doesn\u2019t begin to describe Sargon, the main character. It\u2019s a true Metroidvania that doesn\u2019t drop players onto a blank slate. From the very first stage, Sargon has access to most abilities that other games in its genre locks until the latter stages. He can parry, wall-climb, and dash.\nThat said, a lot of the gameplay is still locked behind abilities obtained as the game progresses. These talents include manipulating time and space, summoning different dimensions, and just plain air dashing. Traversal feels sleeker as time goes by. The Lost Crown ensures that players actually feel the progress of their character.\nBesides normal movement, the title also includes smaller sections designed to test your mastery of its mechanics. The stages themselves are easy enough to intuit, but they\u2019re still a struggle to perfect. Each will reward players with significant powerups or charms. A worthy reward for exploring the map.\nOne small gripe, however, is how the game does not easily allow switching between analog and D-pad controls for movement. If you\u2019re more used to the D-pad for moving your character in a 2D space, you should get used to an analog controller. Thankfully, it\u2019s not a difficult task.\nA gigantic map\nNaturally, the biggest goal of mastering techniques is more map exploration. For a Metroidvania, The Lost Crown is absurdly huge. Rooms give way to more rooms. Areas open up more areas. After a point, it gets overwhelming, though. Thankfully, the game has a new feature that other games in its genre should copy: Memory Shards.\nSoon after the game starts, players will gain the ability to put down a Memory Shard. In essence, the feature acts as a pin on your map. While other games already have a pinning feature, The Lost Crown takes things a step further by attaching a screenshot with every pin. When you run into a spot you can\u2019t get to yet (because you don\u2019t have the corresponding ability), you can put down a Shard to remember the location for future trips. There is a limit to the number of Shards you can have at once, though. On the bright side, they are more than enough to get you through the whole game.\nGripping but not punishing combat\nRather than focusing only on traversal, The Lost Crown also revels in thrilling through combat. Compared to similar games (such as Hollow Knight and Blasphemous), combat is remarkably easy. Even when playing on hard mode, tough bosses only took me around a dozen tries to beat.\nAttack patterns are simple enough to predict. Plus, major boss fights always reset players only to the start of the fight, rather than at the last checkpoint. Even then, checkpoints are abundantly sprinkled throughout the map.\nThat said, getting hit still takes a huge chunk from your health bar. Despite how easy individual fights are, simple bouts of carelessness can easily get you when just traversing through the map. It\u2019s a game that doesn\u2019t want to punish you through combat but still wants to keep you on your toes all throughout.\nA modern style\nFans of the old Prince of Persia might balk at the style of this latest game. The Lost Crown leaves the grittier look of the Sands of Time trilogy and tries a more modern approach. Ubisoft even confirms the new direction in past interviews.\nSargon, armed with a fade and sick dreads, feels right at home in similarly styled games like Valorant as much as he is in his own game. While the change is apparent, it also helps introduce the more magical elements of its mythology.\nIt\u2019s definitely a design choice that might invite polarizing views. However, especially in a genre that loves desolate and broken worlds, The Lost Crown offers a fresher take on a Metroidvania, just as it revamps the look of its formerly gritty franchise.\nIs Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown worthy of your time?\nIn truth, The Lost Crown won\u2019t make it to a lot of top ten Metroidvania lists. It\u2019s easy to get through the game in a few dozen hours. However, it\u2019s still worthy of a playthrough, especially if you love the genre. The Memory Shard feature alone is enough of a convincing point.\nWhile Ubisoft is still busy remaking the classic Sands of Time, The Lost Crown whets your appetite for older Prince of Persia games and what the future has in store for the franchise.\nReviews\nTECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ review: Pro+ffordable\nA new breed of budget smartphone comes to town\nPublished\non\nBy\nSome people around me have asked for a \u2728 good smartphone under a limited budget \u2728. I gave out a few options despite thinking that the words \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbudget\u201d don\u2019t blend well \u2014 at least in the smartphone space. I always say they have to deal with the compromises that come with \u201caffordable\u201d price tags.\nThe notion among budget smartphones is that, you pay less, you get less. But as technology progresses every year, brands like TECNO have made it to a point where they can bring a smartphone to the masses that doesn\u2019t compromise features exclusive to midrangers and flagships.\nBut can the newer TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ live up to its promises of being a great value for money smartphone in the limited budget segment? Scroll through to know all of my thoughts in this 14-day review.\nStart the spark\nBefore we dive into the actual review itself, here\u2019s a quick unboxing for those who want to see the phone\u2019s retail packaging.\nFantastic classic\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not a fan of the design of most budget smartphones. They\u2019re usually flashy and just not built well. But the SPARK 20 Pro+ begs to differ.\nThe Magic Green Skin 2.0 colorway I have features a glossy matte leather texture. It\u2019s 100% eco-friendly and non-harmful to the environment.\nAs shown in the quick unboxing, a clear case is in the package. But because of this exclusive material, I opted not to use it \u2014 and my decision is right as the texture complements my palms well.\nThe SPARK 20 Pro+ is surprisingly thin at exactly 7.55mm. It\u2019s also very lightweight. If I must pinpoint, I barely felt the heft of this phone when I hold it or put it in my pocket.\nThe circular ring camera design may be preferential, but I honestly like how it exudes radiance and elegance. I\u2019d rather have this than the design of SPARK 20 and 20 Pro that clearly reminds us of something else \ud83d\udc40\nFlipping the phone reveals its wondrous curved display with an even thinner middle frame with a golden angle double curve 56.5-degree curvature that makes it so comfortable to hold even if it\u2019s a large slab.\nJust don\u2019t expect anything monumental. This is obviously a frame made out of plastic. And just like most Android smartphones, both the power and volume buttons are on the right side.\nOn its punch hole cutout is where the 32-megapixel selfie camera hides. Notice though how thin the bezels are for a \u201cbudget\u201d smartphone?\nLastly, there\u2019s a dual SIM card slot, microphone, USB-C port, and speaker grilles at its bottom.\nAnd before I forget. It has an in-display fingerprint sensor too that feels snappy. Again, a feature used to be exclusive at least on just midrangers as budget smartphones tend to rely on side-mounted scanner.\nLastly, it has an IP53 water and dust resistance rating out of the box. Some modern midrangers don\u2019t feature any IP rating at all.\nGraphics by Vincenz Lee | GadgetMatch\nAside from the stunningly classic (and very mouthful) color that I rock, the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ is available in several other color choices including Temporal Orbits, Lunar Frost, and Radiant Starstream.\nPure allure\nMost Chinese brands exclusively dedicate curved displays to flagship phones. Well, TECNO has destroyed that barrier with the incorporation of a curved display in such a low-cost smartphone.\nOne of the highlights of the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ that sets it apart from its other siblings is the inclusion of a 6.78-inch AMOLED Full HD+ display with a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The SPARK 20 and SPARK 20 Pro are both equipped with IPS LCD displays, ICYMI.\nAnother thing worth noting? It actually has stereo speakers by DTS!\nIt\u2019s nothing grand with its fair share of lows, mids, and highs. But again for its price, it\u2019s loud enough to fill the entertainment void within you.\nWinter Without You is already sad\u2026 Winter Without XG will even be sadder\nTECNO promises 1000 nits of peak brightness but I\u2019m quite convinced that it\u2019s reserved for HDR content. Though using it under direct sunlight showed minimal glaring and dimming.\nNMIXX\u2019s signature \u201cCHANGE UP\u201d line is a perfect way to describe how brands need to step up and change up their budget smartphone line like how TECNO did\nBut then again, it\u2019s an excellent display for its price. The whites are pearly white\u2026\nGetting DRAMAtic over aespa Ningning\u2019s superiority\n\u2026 and expect an exceptional level of contrast, saturation, and blacks.\nMoreover, its Full HD+ resolution gives plenty of details when watching on Netflix, Disney+, and more.\nSpeaking of, one minor issue on my end is that Netflix isn\u2019t compatible with the device when you search on Google Play. Luckily, Android doesn\u2019t have too much restrictions as I was able to install an APK from a third-party source.\nAnother drawback that shouldn\u2019t be a big of a deal but still be wary of is the fact that it can play YouTube (or any other streaming site) video only up to 2K/QHD 1440p and not 4K/UHD 2160p. That\u2019s mainly due to its chipset limitations.\nModesty at its core\nWhile we\u2019re already on the topic, the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ is powered by a MediaTek G99 Ultimate processor. Its non-plus Pro sibling only runs through Helio G99.\nFinally! A SISTAR19 comeback after 11 long years\nFor socials such as Facebook\u2026\nInstagram Reels\u2026\nX (formerly Twitter)\u2026\nand TikTok, it should perform fast and snappy.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, why not instead ship this phone with a 5G Dimensity chipset instead of compromising it for a \u201cslower\u201d 4G+ Helio processor. I think that\u2019s what sets the SPARK line apart from the gaming-dedicated POVA series.\nFret not! Most of the top-charting games still run decently with its Mali-G57 MC2 GPU.\nWhether that\u2019s Asphalt 9: Legends\u2026\nMobile Legends: Bang Bang\u2026\nCall of Duty: Mobile (CoDM)\u2026\nor even driving a passenger bus in Bus Simulator: Ultimate\u2026\nYou just have to lower down the graphics (and your expectations) as we\u2019re using a budget smartphone with a modest gaming performance. But maybe the Performance Mode can help ease that hindrance.\nBut for the demanding ones like Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact\u2026\nexpect a sluggish performance especially when these are graphics-intensive titles.\nBONUS: playing Subway Surfers was a breeze \ud83e\udd23\nPower-packed\nMultitasking isn\u2019t a slouch as the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ runs with an 8GB of internal memory (RAM).\nTogether with TECNO\u2019s MemFusion Technology, it expands the total configuration by up to 16GB with the unused storage capacity being used to further allocate more apps running in the background.\nSpeaking of storage, you will not feel short with its ample 256GB of onboard storage capacity.\nOn paper, the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ packs a powerful 5000mAh battery.\nPaired with a power-efficient display and chipset, I was able to last more than a day using this phone for the most typical social media and entertainment usage.\nOf course, expect a major battery depletion when you play games.\nIf it runs out of juice, there\u2019s a bundled 33W Super Charge adapter.\nEven though it\u2019s not, in any way, the fastest charging protocol that currently exists, it still gets the job done in about over an hour.\nStart time = 11:21PM\nEnd time = 12:45AM\nNifty tricks\nThe SPARK 20 Pro+ runs through TECNO\u2019s HiOS v13.6.0 based on Android 14.\nMuch like other brands, TECNO has joined the wagon in equipping an iPhone-like pill into its punch-hole cutout to display certain features. Called \u201cDynamic Port\u201d, this software trick up in TECNO\u2019s sleeves displays certain immersive notifications\u2026\nsuch as battery charging prompts\u2026\nas well as Face Unlock animation.\nThere are other extras such as receiving calls and low battery warning \u2014 but that\u2019s pretty much about it.\nCapable camera\nBack in the day, having a 108-megapixel camera was limited to just flagship and high-end midrange smartphones. Who would have thought that we will reach this point in time where a budget smartphone can also rock a 108-megapixel sensor?\nTo be very precise, this phone only rocks a single 1/1.67-inch 108-megapixel camera sensor with an f/1.75 aperture and 6P lens.\nThe other two are just extra sensors: 2-megapixel DoF (Depth of Field) lens and an optical camera. The one at the farther bottom right is just there for aesthetic purposes to complete the \u201cQuadrant Star Array\u201d camera design. The dual flash is placed outside the ring.\nBut then again, the fruit is in the actual pudding. Here are photos I took with the SPARK 20 Pro+ during my 14 days with it.\nI wouldn\u2019t be too nitpicky with its camera performance. Overall, it displays the right amount of exposure, contrast, and sharpness without being too overboard with saturation.\nAlso, HDR seems decent enough for the category it belongs to.\nWith its large sensor, it also supports up to 3x \u201cin-sensor\u201d zoom and up to 10x digital zoom.\n1x wide | 3x in-sensor zoom\nIt\u2019s expected to be a hit or miss situation especially when it just relies with its main sensor for zooming in.\nAs long as you stay still when capturing anything, it will result into a nice output since there is no OIS baked into the sensor anyway. Capturing anything farther than 3x doesn\u2019t make sense.\nStill, in my own creative perspective, 3x zoom is valuable for shooting anything related to food and architecture.\nThere\u2019s also the Super Night Mode based on TECNO\u2019s 9-in-1 Adaptive Pixel Technology. In easier-to-understand terms, it fuses 9 small pixels into one ultra-large pixel and improves light sensitivity by 900%.\nTo finish off the dessert, there\u2019s the front-facing 32-megapixel camera \u2014 also with dual flash.\nI have decided to completely turn off the portrait beauty filters. I\u2019ll let your selfie expertise decide whether or not the SPARK 20 Pro+ takes good selfies.\nAnd just to add, it\u2019s actually a super wide-angle selfie camera with an 88.9-degree FoV (Field of View) \u2014 so you can zoom out and bring more people (or maybe partner, if s/he exists in your life \ud83e\udd72) into the frame.\nIs this your BudgetMatch?\nPricing in most countries have yet to be announced. The SPARK 20 Pro+ is expected to be broadly available across key regions including Africa, Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. One representative from TECNO also stated that the SPARK 20 Pro+ is priced around US$ 180.\nThat roughly converts to just under the PhP 10K / EUR 185 / GBP 142 / SG$ 240 / INR 14,697 mark. Its price alone makes it an A+ contender in the budget smartphone segment.\nFor what its worth, TECNO has delivered some (if not most) features in a smartphone that we only used to see in pricey, high-end models. It has a sleek and light design, a buttery-smooth AMOLED display, loud-enough stereo speakers, and a capable 108-megapixel shooter.\nSure, there are some compromises such as the lack of an ultra-wide lens or a more powerful chipset dedicated for 5G and gaming, but this phone clearly offers more than what other brands do in the same price range.\nWithout any frills, I consider the TECNO SPARK 20 Pro+ a great budget smartphone worthy of the GadgetMatch Seal of Approval.\nHONOR X9b 5G review\nThe phone for surviving everyday life\nWhy the SteelSeries Alias Pro is a steal\nPerfect for streamers, voice actors and podcasters\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown review: A time-travelling Metroidvania\nIt's back to 2.5D basics\nWWE 2K24 cover features Cody Rhodes, Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair\nApple Vision Pro repairs will cost US$ 2,399\nWhat to know about Argylle: Characters, plot, more\nThe return: TopSpin 2K25 teases fans with short trailer\nOPPO Enco Air3s, Enco Buds2 Pro now in Singapore\nSmart introduces new Unli 5G offers\nvivo V29 5G: The perfect 2024 upgrade?\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets free demo\nHONOR X9b 5G: Price, availability in the Philippines\nFinal Fantasy XVI: Echoes of the Fallen\nPhoto Assist on Galaxy S24\nCircle to Search on Galaxy S24\nLive Translate on Galaxy S24\nAI Summarize\u00a0on Galaxy S24\nASUS Zenbook DUO (2024): Not Your Ordinary Laptop\nHONOR X9b 5G: Price, availability in the Philippines\nThe POCO M6 Pro is a daily darling\nSamsung\u2019s Stray Kids collection is now in the Philippines\nSpy x Family Code: White costumes on Street Fighter 6 now available\nSony, Honda demo electric car prototype with a PS5 DualSense\nWhy the SteelSeries Alias Pro is a steal\nASUS Zenbook DUO (2024): Not Your Ordinary Laptop\nIs Sony releasing a new DualSense V2?\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 GadgetMatch Pte.
