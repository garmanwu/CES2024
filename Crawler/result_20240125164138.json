Utilizing string bed, artificial inteligence (AI), and big data in sleeping pattern analytics, the mattress provides an optimal sleeping environment, according to a release from the company.\nThis design, consisting of 14 million low-shrink polyester threads, aims for durability and maintaining shape. The mattress offers an adjustable firmness setting, enabling users to tailor the hardness or softness to their liking.\nThe newly introduced model, Smart String i4, integrates IoT controllers with String Supporter, along with the ANSSil Link App, pressure sensors, and a smart scale installed on the user\u2019s smartphone or smartwatch, enabling the collection and analysis of the user\u2019s sleep condition through an AI-based IoT system.\nUtilizing pressure sensors and applications on the Sleepinbody platform, the smart mattress learns from the collected data, such as sleep information, hours, posture, sleep stages, etc. The AI algorithm then generates personalized sleep data, which users can review daily through the ANSSil Link App.\nBy synchronizing with the user\u2019s smart scale or wearable devices, the Smart String i4 provides an optimal sleep environment and sleep solution, offering various personalized services related to sleep routine, body changes, sleep tips, and more.\nPhoto caption: Smart String i4\nPhoto credit: ANSSil\nShare:\nRate:\nRelated Posts\nNovember 17, 2023\nJune 30, 2021\nNovember 1, 2023\nOctober 17, 2023\nLeave a reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.
