Vistors to the Nikon booth will enjoy a range of activities and displays designed to ignite the senses and demonstrate emerging technologies.\nAt\u00a0CES\u00ae 2024, with the theme of \"co-create seamlessly\" Nikon will showcase its current and emerging advanced solutions and products for consumers and industrial applications. As set forth in its Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2022 - 2025), Nikon aims to become a key technology solutions company in a global society where humans and machines co-create seamlessly by 2030.\nThe Nikon Theater will host a range of speakers, including inspirational Nikon Ambassadors, filmmakers, creators and industry experts. One highlight will be a special conversation about combatting digital misinformation with Santiago Lyon from the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative.\nThe touch and try area will feature the latest Nikon Z series mirrorless cameras, including the highly acclaimed Nikon Z 8, and the new Nikon Z f, which seamlessly converges an iconic retro design with the latest mirrorless technology. Just in time to celebrate the 90th anniversary of NIKKOR optics, attendees will also be able to get their hands on the latest lenses including the NIKKOR Z 135mm f/1.8 Plena and the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/6.3S VR lenses.\nThe Nikon Z f Portrait Studio is a new addition to the booth this year. This activation will offer free portraits from Nikon photographers, using the new Z f camera and Plena lens. This is an opportunity for show-goers to get their updated headshot or social media profile picture captured with high-quality Nikon equipment. Attendees can sign up on-site to participate.\nThe Unreal Ride returns with a new immersive virtual production experience this year, capturing a video of attendees moving through a virtual environment as if it were the real thing. Participants will ride in a vehicle against the backdrop of a giant LED screen. When captured through the lens it will appear as if they are riding through the virtual environment. The ride is captured by MRMC- a subsidiary of Nikon (CEO: Assaff Rawner) using a BOLT X high-speed camera robot against an LED screen, with the video footage captured by the Nikon Z 9 flagship full-frame mirrorless camera. This activation truly expresses the power of combining all these technologies and demonstrates how filmmakers can shoot against any background they can imagine, without being bound by time, season or place.*\nAlso displayed in the booth will be the new ODYSSEY PRO and ODYSSEY smart telescopes, developed jointly with Nikon and Unistellar SAS, France (CEO: Laurent Marfisi). With the ODYSSEY, Unistellar is offering a new generation of smart telescopes that are capable of revealing the farthest celestial marvels, instantly transforming stargazing evenings into adventures across the cosmos with family or friends, even in the middle of the city.\nIn the Healthcare section of the booth, Nikon's microscopes will be exhibited for the first time at CES. Visitors can also enjoy an immersive experience into Nikon Small World, a competition recognizing excellence in photography through the light microscope.\nIndustrial ApplicationsThe latest solutions Nikon provides will be exhibited in the fields of Factory and Energy in the Digital Manufacturing area which Nikon particularly focuses on.\nAt the Factory section of the booth, Nikon's Robot Vision, which is currently being developed i will be displayed. This Robot Vision will be mounted on the end of a robot's arm, where it can identify parts and flexibly process them at high speed, achieving even greater visual acuity than the human eye.\nIn addition, in the Additive Manufacturing Field, satellite parts manufactured with Nikon SLM Solutions AG's metal 3D printer (Laser Powder Bed Fusion method), and turbine blade and combustion chamber processed by the Nikon's latest generation metal 3D Printer (Directed Energy Deposition method) will be displayed.\nAdditionally, Riblet processing will be displayed at the Energy section of the booth. Inspired by sharkskin, Riblet processing uses laser and microfabrication technology to develop micro-surface structures on the object. This can reduce viscosity frictional loss due to the irregular flow of liquids and gases and improve the energy efficiency of various industrial equipment. When applied to aircraft, wind turbine blades or other parts used in various industries, it can help reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and increase power generation efficiency. At the booth, a giant mock-up of an aircraft will be displayed to showcase the process along with the samples.\nNikon will provide innovative technology solutions that anticipate and meet our global customer needs and contribute to a better sustainable world where humans and machines co-create seamlessly to solve societal challenges.\nFor future information, please check the Nikon special website for CES\u00ae 2024, https://www.nikon.com/ces2024/\nAbout Nikon Nikon Inc. is a world leader in digital imaging, precision optics and technologies for photo and video capture; globally recognized for setting new standards in product design and performance for an award-winning array of equipment that enables visual storytelling and content creation.

The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements. Why even post this article before you have ANY content for it?!?\nClick the number buttons under the picture, There ARE already some news items, although none really interesting yet\nTrying to wrap me noggin around a camera capturing\nthe path of a ray of light.

And that, he explains, is why Google Photos is his choice for Gear of the Year.\nAs the year careens to a close, we look back at some of our favorite stories of 2023. From in-depth articles we've long wanted to write to lighter fun fare, it was a jam-packed year at DPReview.\nAs 2023 comes to a close, we'd like to wish you a happy holiday season, offer a sincere thanks for being part of our community, and share why we're so happy to be here celebrating the holidays with you.\nThis morning, DivePhotoGuide (DPG) announced the winning images in the 2023 edition of its underwater photography competition.
