        "raw_content": "Startup Cerebras stands out in the high-risk AI chip arena: 'No one has built a chip this big'\nBy Therese Poletti\nSilicon Valley company has made the largest, fastest chip ever to compete with Nvidia and others\nWhile most computer-chip makers over the past decades have touted the benefits of an ever-shrinking product, a well-funded Silicon Valley company has built what it says is the largest and fastest-ever computer chip, dedicated to AI.\nWhen the five friends who formed Cerebras Systems Inc. decided to start a company, they wanted to build a new computer to address a big problem. They had previously worked on compact, low-power servers for data centers at SeaMicro, later acquired by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Cerebras was officially formed in 2016, six years before the debut of ChatGPT 3, but the founders decided back then to focus on the tough computing problem of AI, where it now competes with the industry leader, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA),\nas well as other chip giants and startups.\nAlso read: As AI matures, Nvidia won't be the only pick-and-shovel company to thrive, BofA analysts say\n\"We built the largest part ever made, the fastest ever made,\" Cerebras co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Feldman said. \"We made a set of trade-offs. It is 100% for AI.\"\nAfter starting up in downtown Los Altos, Calif., Cerebras is now in Sunnyvale, Calif., just minutes away from data-center partner Colovore in nearby Santa Clara, Calif. It now has more than five times the office space, along with a loading dock that a hardware company needs.\nCerebras has developed what it calls a wafer-scale engine with 2.6 trillion transistors and 850,000 cores, all on a silicon wafer about 8.5 inches wide. The wafers have been shipping since 2020, and are part of a total system designed specifically to process queries and training for artificial intelligence. And they are making inroads as an alternative to Nvidia in the high-performance computing market for AI systems.\n\"No one has built a chip this big in the history of compute,\" Feldman told MarketWatch, as he held up the dinner-plate-sized wafer. \"This replaces the CPU and the GPU. This is the compute engine. This replaces everything made by Nvdia and Intel and AMD.\"\nLast year, Cerebras' invention was inducted into Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum, as the largest computer chip in the world.\nCerebras is still private, but with $720 million in venture funding, it is one of the better funded hardware/semiconductor startups. Several analysts believe it will be one of a handful of AI chip startups to succeed. In its last Series F funding round in 2021, the company said it had a valuation of $4 billion.\n\"They have come up with a very unique architecture,\" said Jim McGregor, an analyst with Tirias Research. \"Because of the way their system is architected, they can handle enormous amounts of data. It's not the best solution for every application, because it is obviously not cheap,. But it is an incredible solution for high-end data sets.\" McGregor, quoting Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, said there will be both multi-purpose data centers running AI, and specialized AI factories. \"I would put [Cerebras] in that second category of AI factory,\" he said.\nCerebras' systems are designed for dedicated AI workloads, because AI is so incredibly processing-intensive, with its system designed to keep all the processing on the same giant chip. Feldman gave a simple analogy of watching a football game at home with the beer already on hand, compared with having to go to a store to buy some during the game. \"All the communication is here, you are doing very small, short movements,\" he said. Just as you don't need to get into your car to buy more beer in the football game scenario, \"you don't have to go off-chip, you don't have to wait for all the elements to be in place.\"\nFeldman declined to say what the company's revenue is so far, but said it has doubled this year. This summer, Cerebras got a big boost, with a major contract valued initially at $100 million for the first of nine AI supercomputers to G42, a tech conglomerate in the United Arab Emirates. The first of those systems is running live in the Colovore data center in Santa Clara, Calif., which has a white-glove service for customers behind an unassuming office entrance on a back street lined with RV campers, located a block from a Silicon Valley Power station. The proximity to the power station has now become an important feature for data centers.\n\"This is the cloud,\" Feldman said, standing amid the loud, humming racks and water-cooled servers in a vast windowless room at Colovore. \"It's anything but serene.\"\nBefore the recent deal with G42, Cerebras' customer list was already an impressive collection of high-performance computing customers, including pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),\nfor making better predictions in drug discovery, and AstraZeneca (UK:AZN), for running queries on hundreds of thousands of abstracts and research papers. National laboratories including Argonne National Labs, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and several others, are using the systems to accelerate research, simulate workloads and develop and test new research ideas.\n\"If they can keep their trajectory going, they could be one of the companies that survives,\" said Pat Moorhead, founder and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy.\n\"Ninety out of 100 companies will go out of business. But for the sole fact that they are driving some pretty impressive revenue, they can establish a niche. They have an architectural advantage.\"\nAs large corporations and small businesses alike rush to adopt AI to save on labor costs with (hopefully) better chatbots, conduct faster research or help do mundane tasks, many have been ramping up spending on their data centers to add the extra computing power that's needed. Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of that trend, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) in huge demand. Analysts estimate Nvidia\ncurrently has between 80% and 90% of the market for AI-related chips.\n\"I like our odds,\" said Eric Vishria, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, one of the earliest investors in Cerebras, when asked about Cerebras' potential to survive and succeed in an environment where some AI chip startups are said to be struggling. \"I am not an investor in any of the others. I have no idea how well they are doing, in terms of revenue and actual customer traction,\" he said. \"Cerebras is well ahead of the bunch as far as I understand it. It's not easy, and one of the challenges has been that AI is moving and changing so fast.\"\nFeldman said that, of course, the next milestone for the company would be an initial public offering, but he declined to give any kind of timeframe.\n\"We have raised a huge amount of money and our investors need a return,\" he said when asked if the company plans to go public. \"We don't see that as a goal but as a by-product of a successful company. You build a company on enduring technology that changes an industry. That is why you get up every morning and start companies, to build cool things to move the industry.\"\n-Therese Poletti\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

        "raw_content": "Robotics firms eager to grasp opportunities\nChinese enterprises aim to expand products and markets under five-year industry plan\nBy MA SI |\nChina Daily Global |\nUpdated: 2022-01-09 14:57\nA robotic hand is busy moving trays containing components for smartphones and consumer electronics at a plant in Zhongshan, Guangdong province. DoraHand has sensors on each of its three fingers, which enable it to grab a variety of objects.\n\"DoraHand can pick three oranges, two pears and one apple from a pile of fruit of various sizes,\" said Deng Xiaobai, co-founder and CEO of Dorabot Inc, a Shenzhen-based robotic solutions provider for logistics, express delivery, smart manufacturing, retailing and other industries.\nDorahand is the world's first dexterous robotic hand based on a finger module design, which greatly reduces the use, operation and maintenance costs of such equipment, the company said. The finger module design means it has applications in a wide range of industrial scenarios.\nDorabot is one of a growing number of Chinese robotics companies scrambling to expand their research and development and emerge as an international player in the industry.\nA five-year plan (2021-25) for the robotics industry, unveiled in December by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, called for greater efforts to widen the application of robotics in more sectors, including logistics and manufacturing.\nSong Xiaogang, executive director and secretary-general of the China Robot Industry Alliance, said robots are important carriers of emerging technologies. As key equipment for modern industries, robots can lead an industry's digital development and upgrades of intelligent systems. \"More efforts will be made to popularize the use of logistics robots in labor-intensive scenarios, such as sorting and packaging,\" Song said.\nThe five-year plan also pushes for the wider application of robots in plants producing consumer electronics, auto parts and other fields, Song said.\nChina has been the world's largest market for industrial robots for eight consecutive years. In 2020, the industrial robot density, a metric used to measure a country's level of automation, reached 246 units per 10,000 people in China, nearly twice the global average.\nWang Weiming, an official with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said China aims to double its industrial robot density by 2025, with high-end, advanced robots seeing wider industrial applications.\nSmarter logistics\nExperts said wider use of robots and automated systems in logistics is important to achieving that goal, given the large number of people employed in the delivery sector and the country's booming e-commerce sector. China handled more than 100 billion parcels this year, ranking top in the world, according to data from the State Postal Bureau of China.\nEstablished tech giants are working hard to include robotics and smart logistics networks in their business operations.\nJD Logistics said smart technologies, including robots, automated sorting and unmanned warehouses, are being used in their automated warehouses. The company operates over 1,200 warehouses nationwide, and 39 of them are highly automated, intelligent logistics parks.\nJD Logistics CEO Yu Rui said the company will deploy thousands of autonomous delivery vehicles in the next two to three years. So far, JD Logistics' autonomous delivery vehicles have been used in 25 cities across the nation, with about 2 million orders filled.\nWu Hequan, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said \"The digital transformation of logistics, which includes the application of robotics, AI, cloud computing and blockchain technologies, will make a huge contribution to the industry and society.\"\nDeng, from Dorabot, said the COVID-19 pandemic has driven changes in the business of logistics, which include the acceleration of innovation, automation and digitalization in the workplace. \"During the pandemic, robotics allowed for greater social distancing without affecting productivity,\" Deng said.\nHowever, the penetration of smart logistics products in the industry is still relatively low. Most logistics companies are still relying on manpower or automation, which means there is great growth potential in the industry, Deng said.\nDorabot has also developed a robot parcel sorter that is in use at a DHL Express logistics operation, Gangbuk Service Center, in Seoul, South Korea. Artificial intelligence allows the robotic arm to quickly sort documents and small parcels into separate delivery bins. It is capable of sorting over 1,000 small parcels an hour, and Dorabot said the device has increased efficiency at the center by 41 percent.\nThe robot now processes the largest volume of small parcels volume in the company's South Korean network after it went into operation on July 20.\n\"We are handling record shipment volumes due to the current e-commerce boom, and robotics will help ease our staff 's work burden as well as improve productivity,\" said ByungKoo Han, country manager of DHL Express Korea."
