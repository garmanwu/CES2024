With the Mila Air 3, Mila Halo, and Mila Insights, the company is set to redefine how we perceive and manage air quality in our living spaces, offering innovative and practical solutions for the modern homeowner.\nThese launches, scheduled throughout the year, highlight Mila's commitment to combining innovative technology with environmental well-being.\nSpring 2024: Mila Air 3\nKicking off the year, Mila is set to launch the Mila Air 3 in Spring 2024. Touted as the market's most intelligent air purifier, this upgraded model boasts enhanced performance capabilities. A new, more powerful motor increases the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), ensuring faster and more efficient air purification.\nAlong with its robust performance, the Mila Air 3 is designed to operate more quietly while being energy-efficient, courtesy of its advanced fan technology. This iteration also introduces immediate compatibility with HomeKit, seamlessly integrating with smart home ecosystems right out of the gate.\nFall 2024: Mila Halo\nThe Mila Halo, launching in Fall 2024, is poised to be the market's first combined humidifier and air purifier that addresses both inorganic and organic contaminants. The Halo stands out as the first humidifier capable of eliminating harmful aerosols, including those from inorganic solids in tap water and various bacteria and fungi.\nA standout feature of the Mila Halo is its intelligent control system, which extends the life of the water tank and enhances user convenience. The system intuitively shuts off when the bedroom is unoccupied and activates predictively before bedtime.\nFurthermore, its design ensures that the mist is distributed effectively in the air, avoiding contact with walls and pillows. Customization options with unique panels allow users to align the device with their home decor, adding a touch of personalization.\nWinter 2024: Mila Insights\nIn Winter 2024, Mila plans to launch Mila Insights, a pioneering service that offers detailed reports on home air quality. The service is designed to give homeowners comprehensive insights into their indoor air quality, including peak times and specific pollutants.\nAdditionally, it will offer forecasts of outdoor air quality, alerting users to potential increases in pollen, ozone, or wildfire smoke.\nMila Insights aims to empower users with actionable information, enabling them to make informed decisions about their home's air quality and overall health.\nAppleInsider is at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show this week until January 12, with our reporters seeing the latest HomeKit devices, Apple accessories, 8K monitors, massive televisions, and more in-person throughout the event.

Tra i prodotti dell\u2019azienda si trova anche la gamma delle eBike \u2018assemblate in Europa\u2019.\nCome riportato da J&P Italia, l\u2019agenzia per l\u2019industria elettronica Asia Kingston (HK) ha ricevuto una licenza globale di cinque anni da Reebok per il settore eMobility. L\u2019azienda con sede a Hong Kong, specializzata nello sviluppo e nella distribuzione di marchi su licenza, si \u00e8 fatta un nome all\u2019interno dei settori eMobility, energia solari e tecnologia gaming.\nDiversi prodotti sotto licenza\nSecondo il sito dell\u2019azienda, Asia Kingston \u00e8 gi\u00e0 presente nel mercato globale con prodotti di smart mobility come monopattini elettrici, eBike ed eCargo. Questi sono sotto la licenza di brand come Alfa Romeo F1 Team, Barbie, Elle, Hot Wheels, NASA, Red Bull Racing e Rover. Alcuni di questi monopattini elettrici Red Bull Racing\u00a0sono stati presentati nello stand a Ispo da Reebok E-Mobility.\nTuttavia, il focus dello stand di Ispo di J&P Italia era chiaramente sui prodotti di eMobility sotto licenza del brand Reebok. In Europa, questi sono gestiti da J&P Italia, con sede a Reggio-Emilia, nonch\u00e9 agenzia responsabile dello stand alla fiera.\nReebok ha una storia nelle bici\nA detta del manager di J&P Italia Paolo Ferretti, le bici Reebok (e non le elettriche) un tempo erano gi\u00e0 disponibili sotto licenza. \u201cMolti anni fa, prima dell\u2019acquisizione di Reebok da parte di adidas, il rivenditore di prodotti sportivi britannico JJB Sports ha avuto successo nel mercato con le bici brandizzate Reebok\u201c, ha spiegato Ferretti. \u201cIn quegli anni, nel Regno Unito sono state vendute tra le 15.000 e le 16.000 unit\u00e0\u201c.\nUn altro dipendente di J&B Italia ha spiegato come mai il lancio di monopattini e bici elettriche \u00e8 stato celebrato a una fiera per prodotti sportivi e non relativi alle bici. \u201cLe nostre radici risiedono nell\u2019industria elettronica.

extended equipment life. See more chemical treatment results.\nA manufacturing or heavy industrial facility is much more than machines and equipment. It's also a vast reservoir of data generated by sensors, analyzers and human workers. When manufacturers are able to acquire, analyze and respond to all of that data, they elevate information into something far more valuable \u2014 business intelligence. See how Solenis helped an oil refinery improve its data visibility and, as a result, its competitiveness.\nCase History\nAn oil refinery in the Gulf Coast region of the United States was experiencing high iron and surface pitting of carbon steel. The cause of these problems was identified as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). After identifying low-flow heat exchanger velocity as a contributing factor, Solenis recommended that the refinery employ an OnGuard\u2122 2-plus control system to model the operating conditions of a challenged lean amine cooler in the sulfur recovery unit. Data from the OnGuard system revealed that the heat exchanger was leaking amine, which was contributing to microbiological growth. The system also quantified the effect of biofouling on corrosion and heat transfer. Armed with this information, the refinery was able to take corrective measures that resulted in a 66 percent reduction in carbon steel pitting and a 52 percent reduction in carbon steel corrosion. The refinery was also able to increase heat exchanger efficiency, extend heat exchanger bundle life by 30 percent and eliminate unscheduled downtime, all of which strengthened the refinery\u2019s competitive position.\nCase history\nBy using our filler-fiber optimization program, a paper producer cut its annual costs by more than $1 million.\nFor any business, regardless of sector, protecting the bottom line is the highest priority. One of the easiest ways to increase profitability is to reduce operating costs, though it sometimes requires an external partner that can help you see your business in new ways and that can provide a novel solution. Learn how Solenis brought together insights and innovative technology to help a paper producer reduce its manufacturing costs without affecting end product quality.\nCase History\nDue to tough market conditions and high competitive pressure, a European paper producer was challenged to reduce its operating costs on a 640-ton-per-day machine producing high-quality copy grades. Replacing high cost virgin fiber with a lower cost filler was a key initiative. Previous efforts to increase filler content either reduced productivity or reduced tensile strength significantly, leading to quality issues, both of which limited the mill\u2019s ability to improve its operating costs. Solenis evaluated the mill\u2019s system and recommended a new filler-fiber optimization program called OptiFill\u2120. Since permanently converting to Solenis\u2019 OptiFill program, the mill has increased its filler use from 20 to 25 percent and has realized significant cost savings \u2014 more than $1 million annually \u2014 without compromising quality or productivity.\nCase history\nA mining operation used our antiscalants to reduce downtime for cleaning, boosting annual profitability by $2 million.\nProfitability is the most important measure of the success of a business. A business that isn\u2019t profitable won\u2019t survive, which is why taking actions that improve the bottom line is one of the most important tasks of managers running complex manufacturing and industrial operations. Discover how Solenis helped a mining operation improve its profitability with advanced chemistry and deep applications expertise.\nCase History\nA gold mining operation in the Western United States was having difficulty regulating the acid and lime feeds in its process water system, leading to scale deposition in the water lines. Solids in the reclaim water were also contributing to the deposition problem, which required significant downtime for removing scale. The mine contacted Solenis for help because every hour of lost production cost the mine approximately $70,000. After conducting a thorough system review, the Solenis team recommended that the mine implement a new treatment program using Zalta\u2122 antiscalants. Despite pH swings and variable process flow rates, the Zalta antiscalant program significantly reduced scale deposition in the water lines and reclaim water. As a result, downtime for cleaning was reduced by more than three hours per month, which improved the mill\u2019s profitability by more than $2 million a year.\nCase history\nOur creping adhesives helped a mill increase its machine speed by 7 percent, boosting productivity and revenue.\nBeing productive is all about bringing products to market more quickly. Sometimes this requires investing in new equipment. The ultimate goal, however, is to produce more in less time without making a capital investment. This involves collecting and analyzing data, making effective decisions and streamlining processes. Learn how Solenis helped a tissue manufacturer boost its productivity and improve the quality of its finished product with innovative chemistry.\nCase History\nA North American tissue mill wanted to increase the speed of its light dry crepe (LDC) Yankee machine by increasing steam pressure and temperature. Unfortunately, the mill\u2019s existing creping program became too hard and too adhesive at high temperature and low creping moisture. After contacting Solenis for help, the mill agreed to trial Crepetrol\u2122 9200 creping adhesive. Designed specifically for LDC machines making bath or facial tissue, Crepetrol 9200 creping adhesive provides a soft, controlled adhesion Yankee coating at high temperature with good moisture control. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the mill was able to increase the speed of its machine by 7 percent and improve the hand-feel properties of its tissue. Ultimately, the mill increased its productivity and enjoys the potential to increase its annual revenue by more than $2 million.\nCase history\nWe enabled a paper mill to increase its annual revenue by $1.3 million by reducing its COD load.\nIn light of growing concerns about climate change, pollution and natural resource depletion, green business practices have become a strategic necessity that demands a rigorous, disciplined approach. Mines, paper mills, refineries and other industrial operations must find innovative ways to improve their environmental performance as measured by a number of indicators, such as water consumption, energy use, and airborne and water emissions. At Solenis, we help our customers develop sustainable business practices every day \u2014 read about one example in the paper industry.\nCase History\nWhen a European packaging paper producer tried to increase its production, its effluent treatment plant proved too small to cope with the increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) load. Faced with either uprating the effluent plant at a significant capital expense or limiting production in order to stay below the discharge consent limits, mill management contacted Solenis for help. After conducting a thorough system audit, the Solenis team proposed that the mill trial an innovative chemical program that fixes starch fragments and other organic fines to the paper fibers, which in turn removes those elements from the effluent. The mill agreed to evaluate the program and shortly after the trial startup the COD load was reduced by more than 11 percent and the mill\u2019s paper machines were ramped up to full capacity, thereby maximizing paper production. Due to the success of the trial, the mill permanently adopted the Solenis program, which is marketed as \u201cBiobond. Improving the Sustainability of Paper\u2120 program. To date, the Biobond program has enabled the mill to increase its annual revenue by approximately $1.3 million.\nCase history\nA chemical processing plant used our XD3899 microbiocide to control corrosion rates and extend equipment life.\nIn industries with harsh operating environments, maximizing the life expectancy of equipment at the lowest possible cost is a strategic priority. This often requires a multi-pronged approach that involves advanced water treatment chemistry, preventative maintenance and resource conservation. See how Solenis helped a chemical processing plant protect its assets \u2014 and its bottom line \u2014 with an innovative program to fight corrosion and biofouling.\nCase History\nA chemical processing plant located in the Southwest United States was using a stabilized phosphate treatment program, with acid for pH control and bleach for microbiological control, in its cooling towers. Unfortunately, high copper corrosion rates were impacting process refrigeration reliability. While reducing corrosion was the priority, the plant also wanted to reduce metals discharge to its effluent plant and eliminate the use of acid. After conducting an audit of the plant\u2019s cooling water system, the Solenis team recommended the combined use of an alkaline corrosion inhibitor and Biosperse\u2122 XD3899 microbiocide, a mild oxidizing biocide that effectively controls biofilm formation. The new treatment program reduced copper corrosion rates by more than 75 percent, extending the life of the plant\u2019s capital-intensive equipment. The program also enabled the plant to reduce metals discharge in the effluent, reduce chemical treatment costs by $30,000 per year and reduce water use by 22 million gallons per year.\nWe're here to help.\nWhether you want to build a career that lets you make a real difference or need expert advice on your water treatment and process improvement challenges, we\u2019re ready to deliver.\nIf you have a technical question or need insights from a specialist, we can help.\nContact an expert\nUse your expertise and ingenuity to help solve our customers\u2019 sustainability challenges.\nJoin our team\n\u00a92014-2024 Solenis\nClose\nSolenis uses cookies to give you the best possible experience.
