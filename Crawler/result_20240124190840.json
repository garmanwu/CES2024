Last year, we\nexpanded testing\nso that developers can evaluate these new technologies as they\nincorporate them into their solutions.\nToday, we\u2019re sharing an update on the next stage of the\nPrivacy Sandbox for the web, as we work towards deprecating\nthird-party cookies in Chrome in the second half of 2024.\nGeneral availability of the Privacy Sandbox APIs\nStarting with the\nJuly Chrome release, and over the following weeks, we\u2019ll make the Privacy\nSandbox relevance and measurement APIs available to all Chrome\nusers.\nWith this milestone, developers can utilize these APIs to\nconduct scaled, live-traffic testing, as they prepare to operate\nwithout third-party cookies. Prior to third-party cookie\ndeprecation, we don\u2019t plan to make any significant changes\nto the API interfaces.\u00a0Companies who haven\u2019t already\ndone so should evaluate integrating these APIs into their\nproducts as they plan their transition to more private\nsolutions.\nSupporting scaled testing with one percent third-party cookie\ndeprecation in Q1 2024\nTo get ready for the web without third-party cookies, it\u2019s\nimportant that the ecosystem prepare in advance, including\nevaluating\nsolutions\nwhich incorporate the Privacy Sandbox APIs. To support this, we\nwill take the following additional steps over the coming\nquarters.\nIn Q1 of 2024, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for one\npercent of Chrome users. This will support developers in\nconducting real world experiments that assess the readiness and\neffectiveness of their products without third-party cookies. In\naddition, in Q4 of 2023, we will introduce the ability for\ndevelopers to simulate Chrome third-party cookie deprecation\nfor a configurable percentage of their users. This will enable developer-controlled testing that can\nbenefit from higher levels of third party cookie-less traffic.\nThis plan has been developed in consultation with the UK\u2019s\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA), in accordance with our\nCommitments and\npublic timeline. We will continue to address comments made by the CMA, as we\nprepare for third-party cookie deprecation beyond one percent of\nChrome users once the CMA has completed its assessment.\nWorking with the industry\nWe're encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox\nand will continue to work with the industry on how these\ntechnologies can support the transition to a more private web.\n\u201cAs a leader in testing Protected Audience (formerly\nFLEDGE), OpenX appreciates Google\u2019s continued\ncommitment to working with the ecosystem to enhance consumer\nprivacy. Increased traffic and cookieless testing options\nwill significantly help the evaluation of the Privacy\nSandbox solutions, such as Protected Audience, and the\npreparedness for Chrome\u2019s third-party cookie\ndeprecation.\"Paul RyanCTOOpenX\n\u201cAt RTB House, we value the Chrome team's\nconsideration of tester feedback, including the necessity to\ntest technologies on traffic that doesn't rely on 3rd party\ncookie data. We are ready to test on increased volume, plan\nto conduct scaled developer experiments and look forward to\ncollaborating across the programmatic supply chain on them.\nWe believe that the test results will enable us to further\nrefine our solutions based on the privacy-preserving APIs so\nthat they can compete on an equal footing with legacy\ntechnologies that rely on 3rd party\ncookies.\u201d\nLukasz WlodarczykVP of Programmatic Ecosystem Growth & InnovationRTB House\nEchoing comments from the\nCMA\u2019s Q1 Report, we expect a wide range of testing methodologies based on\ndifferent testing goals \u2014 from single-company tests, to\nbroader coordinated tests across multiple organizations. We also\nencourage developers to adopt and test the Privacy Sandbox APIs\nas part of end-to-end solutions.\nPlease visit the\nChrome developer blog\nfor more information on the rollout of the Privacy Sandbox APIs.\nWe\u2019ll provide more details over the coming months,\nincluding additional guidance on testing metrics and\nmethodologies.\nWe look forward to continuing to collaborate with participants\nacross the industry, as we reach the final stages of our journey\nto deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome, and improve privacy\nacross the web for everyone."

Website developers can thus write code that calls those APIs to deliver and measure ads to visitors with compatible browsers.\nThat is to say, sites can ask Chrome directly what kinds of topics you're interested in \u2013 topics automatically selected by Chrome from your browsing history \u2013 so that ads personalized to your activities can be served. This is supposed to be better than being tracked via third-party cookies, support for which is being phased out. There are other aspects to the sandbox that we'll get to.\nWhile Chrome is the main vehicle for Privacy Sandbox code, Microsoft Edge, based on the open source Chromium project, has also shown signs of supporting the technology. Apple and Mozilla have rejected at least the Topics API for interest-based ads on privacy grounds.\n\"Today, we mark a major milestone for the Privacy Sandbox for the Web, reaching 'general availability' on Chrome for the relevance and measurement APIs,\" said Anthony Chavez, VP of Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, in an announcement. \"This milestone is a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web.\"\nGoogle's definition of privacy is not the dictionary definition most might understand. Rather it's the ad industry and legal definition where privacy is not so much a binary state \u2013 public or private \u2013 but a notionally consent-based trade of information to gain access to ad-supported content.\nWhat Google calls a \"more private web\" \u2013 or less intrusive web \u2013 aims to be better, at least, than the personal data free-for-all made possible by web cookies.\n\"Third-party cookies and other identifiers make it possible to track your activity across sites and apps, and your data can be shared more widely than you would like,\" the biz explained in a video accompanying its announcement.\n\"The Privacy Sandbox technologies will offer sites and apps alternative ways to show you personalized ads while keeping your personal information more private and minimizing how much data is collected about you.\"\nThese APIs include:\nThese technologies, Google and industry allies believe, will allow the super-corporation to drop support for third-party cookies in Chrome next year without seeing a drop in targeted advertising revenue.\n\"The future of commerce media hinges on scalable, open-source solutions that respect consumer expectations, and today\u2019s milestone gives Criteo and other industry players a valuable opportunity to ramp up testing efforts and gain deeper insight into the utility of the Privacy Sandbox APIs,\" said Todd Parsons, chief product officer at ad biz Criteo, in a supportive statement solicited by Google.\nCoincidentally, Chrome turns 15 years old this month and Google has announced some changes.\nThe desktop version will get a makeover with the biz's Material You design theme, and the Chrome Web Store, now with better browser extension security checking, has gotten similar treatment. Along similar lines, Google Safe Browsing has been upgraded to run in real-time, to better reflect that many phishing sites exist for only a few minutes before being dismantled to avoid detection.\nNor everyone in the ad industry is so sanguine about the transition, however. Marketing advocacy group Movement for an Open Web, which has opposed the third-party cookie phaseout as a power grab, challenged the Privacy Sandbox project when API availability was initially teased in May.\n\"Privacy Sandbox removes the ability of website owners, agencies and marketers to target and measure their campaigns using their own combination of technologies in favor of a Google-provided solution,\" James Rosewell, co-founder of MOW, told The Register at the time.\n\"No one would accept all food retailers closing the home baking aisle and forcing everyone to buy their own brand bread. Why would anyone accept Google and Apple\u2019s identical behavior in digital markets?\"\nGoogle has been preparing the Chrome-using public for this transition over the past few months with a popup notification announcing new privacy controls tailored to the new ad tech.\nControversially, in the US, where lack of coherent privacy rules suit ad companies just fine, the popup merely informs the user that these APIs are now present and active in the browser but requires visiting Chrome's Settings page to actually manage them \u2013 you have to opt-out, if you haven't already. In the EU, as required by law, the notification is an invitation to opt-in to interest-based ads via Topics. \u00ae\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nMore about\nNarrower topics\nBroader topics\nSend us news\nOther stories you might like\nThe Register\nBiting the hand that feeds IT\nCopyright.

Take a look at these updates and how they build on improvements we made to our ecosystem at last year\u2019s CES.\nA new way to share files\nSharing pictures, files and text between devices should be simple, fast and convenient. In 2020, we introduced Nearby Share to make it easy to share files across devices. Samsung also has its own capability called Quick Share, which is loved by their users.\nCollaborating with Samsung, we're bringing the best of our sharing solutions together into a singular cross-Android solution under the Quick Share1 name. We've integrated the experiences and created the best default, built-in option for peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of devices in the Android and Chromebook ecosystems. And to make sharing even more seamless between devices, we\u2019re working with leading PC manufacturers like LG to expand Quick Share to Windows PCs as a pre-installed app.\nThis means with a simple tap of the new Quick Share icon, you can see a list of available devices close by. You remain in control of your privacy, and can choose in your phone\u2019s settings who can discover your device and send files, whether it\u2019s everyone, only your contacts or just your own devices. Quick Share will start rolling out to current Nearby Share enabled devices next month.\nFast Pair support expands to the big screen\nWhen you unwrap a new set of headphones, you want to be able to quickly pair and start using it with your devices. Fast Pair is a way to quickly find and connect your nearby Bluetooth accessories to your devices such as your Android phone or Chromebook.\nIn the next month, Fast Pair support2 is expanding to Chromecast with Google TV and will be expanding to more Google TV devices later this year. After putting your accessory in pairing mode, it\u2019s just a tap to connect your compatible headphones or speakers and start enjoying your favorite movies and shows \u2014 even if your partner is reading a book next to you. And with audio output controls, you can easily switch back to your default TV audio at any time. Give it a try and see why people have made over 660 million Fast Pair pairings to date.\nCasting capabilities come to more apps and devices\nSince we launched Chromecast, we've been working to bring casting capabilities to more apps and devices. Starting today, you can cast TikTok content3 from your phone to your Chromecast built-in devices. And we\u2019re just getting started \u2014 soon you\u2019ll be able to cast LIVE videos from TikTok to your big screen.\nYou can also look forward to more devices launching with Chromecast built-in, such as the 2024 LG TV series. And later this year, we\u2019ll extend Chromecast built-in to LG Hospitality and Healthcare so that when you're on the go, you can continue to enjoy a show or movie from your streaming apps on the LG TV in your hotel room, without having to log into each app and having to remember to log out when you're done.\nAnd as always, your Google TV devices come with Chromecast built-in, including the latest 2024 Hisense ULED and ULED X Series and TCL Q Class and TCL QM7 line announced at CES this year. In fact, there are now over 220 million monthly active Google TV devices and other Android TV OS devices.\nWe love listening to music and podcasts, and we\u2019re rolling out a new casting feature this year that will allow you to move what\u2019s playing on Spotify and YouTube Music from your compatible Pixel phone to your docked Pixel Tablet when the device is close by. This way you can continue listening to your playlist once you\u2019re home.\nMore interoperability across devices with Matter\nAs we add more smart devices to our homes from all kinds of different companies, we want them to just work together. That\u2019s why we embrace and invest in industry standards to create greater interoperability between them.\nWe're helping more homes be ready for Matter. In the future, LG TVs and select Google TV and other Android TV OS devices will act as hubs for Google Home. So if you have a Nest Hub, Nest Mini or compatible TV, it\u2019s easy to add Matter devices to your home network and locally control them with the Google Home app.\nGoogle apps and services come to more cars\nAndroid Auto4 is also getting some helpful upgrades. Coming first to the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning in the coming months, electric vehicles compatible with Android Auto can share real-time battery information with Google Maps. This integration will make driving an electric vehicle easier by providing your estimated battery level upon arrival at your destination, suggesting charging stops along the way and even estimating how long charging will take based on your vehicle.\nRelated Article\nRelated Article\nWhat's new with Android for cars at CES\nThe latest navigation, apps and entertainment updates for Android Auto and cars with Google built-in\nannounced at CES 2024.\nAnd, many top car brands come with Google built-in, which integrates helpful apps like Google Maps, Google Assistant and more on Google Play directly into your car\u2019s display. This experience will be launching soon across other top car brands like Nissan, Lincoln and more. And starting to roll out today, you can send trips that you\u2019ve planned on your phone directly to Google Maps on your car display. When you\u2019re parked, you can also make the most of your time with new apps on Google Play that are optimized for use in cars so you can safely browse content on Chrome and watch shows from PBS KIDS and Crunchyroll.

        "raw_content": "The Ultimate Guide to the Privacy Sandbox\nIt might have been delayed, but the end of third-party tracking cookies is coming in the second half of 2024, and businesses can\u2019t afford to keep pretending otherwise. The good news is that thanks to this delay, there is still a small window of opportunity for companies to prepare for the cookieless future by engaging with the Privacy Sandbox.\nThis guide will give you everything you need to know to use the Privacy Sandbox, including:\nTable of Contents:\nWhat is the Privacy Sandbox?\nThe Privacy Sandbox is an initiative spearheaded by Google designed to build a series of tools and standards for websites and advertisers to access user information while respecting user privacy. It is not just a Google project, it is being developed publicly with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in order to implement feedback from market participants.\nThe project started in August 2019 and was primarily designed to build alternative ways for advertisers to connect with users without using third-party tracking cookies. Tracking cookies were the foundation of modern targeting advertising but had become a source of mounting privacy concerns for users.\nFor a long time, these concerns were overlooked by the advertising industry, but the relationship between customers and advertisers began to sour, with 74% of users worried about how they were tracked online. Third-party cookies were a particular concern, as they enable companies to identify and track one user across multiple sites, building a scarily accurate picture of an individual person.\nIt should be noted that there is a bit of cognitive dissonance here. Users are worried about tracking, but 91% are still more likely to purchase a product if they encounter an ad with some level of personalization.\nThe Privacy Sandbox is an attempt to solve this challenge.\nCustomer acquisition costs have increased. Marketers now need to think about where to invest and reallocate budgets. It\u2019s a change but also an opportunity for those who are best prepared. Experts from across every type of online retail share where you should be investing right now.\nHow does the Privacy Sandbox work?\nThe Privacy Sandbox is being developed for both the Web and Android. The initiative brings together a number of companies and contributors, including us here at RTB House, in order to solve three key challenges:\nIt achieves these aims via a number of proposals. While each proposal differs in its approach, they all operate on the principle that personalized advertising should be conducted through groups of anonymized users, called cohorts, rather than directly to individuals.\nThere are currently four main proposals:\nPrivacy Sandbox Attribution Reporting API\nTraditionally, the best way to measure conversions, and attribute those conversions to a specific advertiser, was to use third-party cookies to determine who is responsible for a user. The retirement of third-party cookies risks removing the ability of advertisers to measure their campaigns, rendering it difficult for them to refine their methods, or demonstrate their impact on a client\u2019s bottom line.\nThe Attribution Reporting API is the Privacy Sandbox solution to this challenge. Instead of using third-party tracking cookies to identify users, it relies on the measurement of two events that are linked together by the API in a privacy-preserving way:\nThis enables the API to create two levels of reports which may be used simultaneously:\nThis proposal will provide advertisers with the tools they need to conduct the same rich level of reporting they do today, and to continue to optimize their campaigns.\nFLEDGE\nFLEDGE is a proposal that succeeded Google\u2019s original idea called TURTLEDOVE. It used the concepts and findings from the first proposal to create a more robust solution that could be tested in a live environment with real users. FLEDGE consists of a five-step process:\nOne of the examples of industry input that expanded the original idea was Product-Level TURTLEDOVE from RTB House that enabled relevant product recommendations while preserving the privacy of individual users in the spirit of the original concept. Here is a simple infographic showing how it works.\nIn 2022, RTB House also became the first Demand Side Platform (DSP) to successfully test FLEDGE to purchase real ad impressions. We also released the first in-depth white paper on real FLEDGE tests, which detailed our results, and recommended the next steps. You can find a summary of it here.\nTopics API\nGoogle\u2019s Topics API is the second iteration of the FloC (Federated learning of Cohorts) proposal. Topics API is designed to allow privacy-friendly behavioral advertising, based on user browsing habits.\nTo achieve this, the Chrome browser would be able to determine a number of topics based on the websites you have visited, such as music, TV, sports, tech, or travel, and store them in your browser as a top interest for that week. It will define the top topics per week and keep them stored for three weeks, before deleting old topics and defining new ones.\nThis information is stored exclusively on a user\u2019s device, and users will be able to control these topics in Chrome, and delete any that they don\u2019t want or like. Topics API is a significant improvement over the FloC proposal, as it reduces the risk of fingerprinting by eliminating the need for a user ID, and provides a significant amount of agency to users.\nCHIPS\nCHIPS stands for Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State. Certain applications, for example maps or shopping baskets, need to have some knowledge of a user\u2019s activities on a site in order to function. This knowledge is usually stored in cookies, which can track users across sites. This doesn\u2019t have a direct impact on advertisers. This is a useful way to showcase how the Privacy Sandbox is not only providing advertising features but preventing tracking more generally.\nCHIPS is designed to prevent this by allowing widgets to identify a user\u2019s activity on a single site in order to store information related to that specific use-case. It does this by creating a cookie for each site, rather than one cookie for each user.\nThis means that websites will be able to continue using widgets to provide better functionality, while eliminating the risk of data leakage for users. All-in-all, an elegant solution.\nThese proposals are just the beginning\nThese proposals are simply the most current step in the Privacy Sandbox journey. If the tests show that they are valuable, they will all form part of the final product in one way or another. This process has already begun, as FLEDGE was the result of a number of enhancements to the TURTLEDOVE proposal that preceded it.\nIf you want to keep an eye on the Privacy Sandbox roadmap, you can find more information here for the Web, and here for Android.\nCan I already implement the Privacy Sandbox?\nWhile development is still ongoing, the Privacy Sandbox is very much ready for advertisers and brands alike. It is a big, ambitious, project, so there will undoubtedly be incremental improvements, but our tests have shown its potential to deliver great value for both supply- and demand-sides of the advertising industry.\nEarly adopters will have two big advantages over latecomers. The first is the ability to have a say in how the project develops. For example, RTB House was able to design proposals that we knew would benefit the advertising ecosystem because we have been working with Google from Day One, helping to shape the future of the Privacy Sandbox.\nSecondly, businesses who start early will gain invaluable experience with the tools necessary to thrive in the cookieless future.

The initial aim is to test ad relevance via its new Topics API, along with FLEDGE and Attribution Reporting that allows remarketing and ad click measurement without tracking behavior across sites.\nOrigin trials will let Google test experimental Chrome technology with a limited number of people to make sure it's ready for general use. Starting today, developers can begin testing code for Topics, FLEDGE and Attribution Reporting in the Canary Chrome beta \"and we'll progress to origin trials with a limited number of Chrome Beta users as soon as possible,\" it wrote. Eventually, the company will expand trials to a stable version of Chrome to access a larger user subset. All the trials will be available globally, with updates available here.\nGoogle will be testing updated settings that allow you to control your participation in the origin trials. For example, under the \"Browser-based ad personalization\" section, you'll be able to remove various interests estimated by Chrome, or remove specific sites that \"define your interests.\" You'll also be able to control how ads are measured and choose how to participate in spam and fraud reduction that helps advertisers detect bots.\nPrivacy Sandbox has met with significant criticism, particularly from EU and UK advertisers that claim removing cookies will hurt their ad businesses. Government also has concern that the new system will only serve to strengthen Google's stranglehold on the online ad marketplace, while putting consumer privacy at risk. Last month, however, Google agreed to a legally binding set of commitments with UK regulators to address those issues."

Enter Apple SKAdNetwork and Google Privacy Sandbox, two privacy-centric solutions that, while fundamentally aligned, chart divergent paths in revolutionizing Ad Tech.\nAs an in-app DSP built with a north star of adapting to device ID-less advertising, Dataseat (now part of Verve Group) has a unique view of how both of these technologies are impacting app advertisers now\u2013and what we expect to see in the near future.\nDifferences and similarities\nSKAdNetwork (SKAN) and Privacy Sandbox both seek to remove dependence on device identifiers for tracking users across sites and apps.\nBut while SKAN is solely focused on measurement, Privacy Sandbox goes well beyond this with technologies that can also benefit targeting\u2013in the absence of device IDs\u2013based on user behaviors.\nThis is the most crucial difference between the two technologies: while Apple\u2019s SKAN gives advertisers a privacy-safe method to measure campaign success, it currently offers nothing to help them drive campaign success in the first place\u2013putting the onus entirely on the advertiser and their partners.\nAs a result, advertisers have a much greater challenge to overcome for their iOS apps in 2024 vs on Android.\nContextual targeting has emerged as the new way of powering iOS performance. Yet it goes without saying that comparing Behavioral to Contextual targeting is not an apples-to-apples situation. This is because while both seek to find the target audience, the Behavioral approach does this with generally stronger and more reliable signals which track users across sites and apps.\nOnly Android campaigns will benefit from Behavioral targeting within the constraints of the new SKAN and Privacy Sandbox standards. Since Google is fundamentally powered by advertising, it is no surprise it is keen on showing that privacy-preserving advertising and behavioral targeting can co-exist. Accordingly, Google Privacy Sandbox promises to offer advertisers a plethora of behavioral data to use when choosing who to show their ads to.\nFor user acquisition, Privacy Sandbox\u2019s Topics API shares signals about user actions and interests to help advertisers find relevant audiences. On the re-engagement side, the Protected Audience API offers audience targeting\u2013helping advertisers find specific users of their own apps in the crowd.\nTimelines and status\nSKAN is live and has been widely used by app developers since 2021. According to Apple, it must be used from Spring 2024 for any developers wishing to track their ad campaigns. After this, prevention of fingerprinting is expected to be enforced.\nPrivacy Sandbox, on the other hand, is currently still mostly in the proposal phase and working towards beta testing. Google is partnering with Ad Tech leaders to validate the system before rolling it out more widely, so we can expect varying timelines for various different features, with the Topics API most likely launching first.\nThere is little data on how Privacy Sandbox impacts campaigns in the wild yet. But we should expect it to be closer to the status quo vs SKAN because of the interest-based targeting it permits.\nThe privacy vs performance dilemma\nOne question is whether Google\u2019s approach can succeed in achieving both their privacy goals and campaign performance goals at once: is good ad personalisation possible within the realms of increased privacy? Ironically, the more behavioral targeting capabilities that Google manages to include in Privacy Sandbox, the less it may succeed on the privacy side.\nMixed consumer reactions to the Topics API rollout have highlighted that the path to striking the right balance will not be entirely straightforward. Not only does Privacy Sandbox need to offer the right technical solution but it also needs the right marketing to help consumers understand that this is net-positive for their web and app browsing experience.\nCompounding this dilemma is the fact that the more comprehensive Privacy Sandbox becomes as a solution, the more network traffic, processing and filesystem space it will take up\u2013will average consumers be capable of understanding that this is a positive thing, or will it be labeled as bloatware?\nAt Dataseat, we agree with Google that there is room for personalization within privacy-preserving advertising. However, we do not see any signs that this will be addressed on iOS any time soon. The next version of SKAdNetwork will apparently support re-engagement, but this most likely only refers to measurement of campaigns\u2013not targeting.\nWhat would it take for Apple to invest in helping their developers target relevant users? The strongest drivers here would be revenue opportunities and consumer attitudes. Improving advertising performance does not directly benefit Apple unless it can use this to promote its own advertising tech. Though this idea was popular in the Ad Tech community after ATT was announced, there has been little to back it up since\u2013beyond the expansion of Apple Search Ads.\nMeanwhile, Android may be in a strong position to take more marketing dollars from iOS for advertisers preferring an easier ride to achieving ROAS goals. Starting from 2021, when Android ad spend soared up 8-21% and dropped on Apple within just two weeks of the iOS 14.5 release, Android has been getting an increasingly bigger piece of the ad budget pie. Q2 2022 data reported that 54% of ad revenue was generated by Android applications while iOS applications generated 46%.\nBut the fact remains that iOS continues to generate the most in-app revenue (with 83 billion consumer spend on iOS vs 41 billion on Android in 2022 as per Statista). Achieving ROAS goals on iOS is getting harder, but no less important.\nMobile app consumer spending worldwide from 2022 to 2027, by store\nClick on image for full size\nSource: Statista\nThis is not to say that achieving ROAS goals on Android with Privacy Sandbox is also a done deal: ad platforms will need to make major changes to adapt to the new paradigm which effectively flips targeting logic on its head. Those built with privacy in mind from the beginning are in a stronger position to do this.\nWhat\u2019s in store for 2024?\nInvesting in contextual targeting is the best path for iOS. With the upcoming restrictions on fingerprinting expected in Spring 2024, solving this for iOS is more urgent than ever.\nGoogle is likely to make it easier for advertisers to target efficiently on Android when compared to iOS, but there are a lot of unknowns on how this will look in the wild\u2013and how long it will take.\nThe industry anticipates privacy measures on Android later in 2024-2025. For advertisers, it makes sense to become familiar with Sandbox and to work with Ad Tech partners which are investing in Sandbox already, so that they have an upper hand with all the collected campaign learnings when privacy is fully on.\nAbout the author\nRich Jones is the Director of Product at Dataseat, where he is helping build an innovative, privacy-first contextual mobile DSP.

This is a part of deploying Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its solution to provide more private, targeted advertising on the Internet. Google says that it got feedback from developers, publishers, marketers, and regulators asking for more time to evaluate as well as to test the new technologies before disabling third-party cookies in Chrome. Google in 2020 had said it intended to deploy the solution \u201cwithin two years\".\nAnthony Chavez, Vice President at Privacy Sandbox, gave a timeline of how Google intends to deploy its Privacy Sandbox technologies in the Chrome browser. The company is expanding the scope of testing Privacy Sandbox APIs starting in \u201cearly August till the end of the year\u201d and \u201cinto 2023.\u201d Google expects that the Privacy Sandbox APIs will be launched by Q3 2023 and will be generally available in Chrome. It intends to \u201cbegin phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in the second half of 2024.\u201d\nGoogle said that it has worked with developers, publishers, marketers, and regulators via forums like the W3C to refine design proposals. It also reached an agreement with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on how to develop and release the Privacy Sandbox in Chrome worldwide. As per the Privacy Sandbox website, the proposals are in various stages of the development process.\n\u201cThe most consistent feedback we've received is the need for more time to evaluate and test the new Privacy Sandbox technologies before deprecating third-party cookies in Chrome. This deliberate approach to transitioning from third-party cookies ensures that the web can continue to thrive, without relying on cross-site tracking identifiers or covert techniques like fingerprinting,\u201d Chavez said in the note.\nAs mentioned, Google had earlier said that it will start to phase out third-party cookies from Chrome browser \"within 2 years\". These third-party cookies are used by companies to track users' activities on the internet which raised concerns about privacy violations. Google's Privacy Sandbox solution will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID. This will result in delivery of more targeted ads as well as making healthy, ad-supported web rendering third-party cookies obsolete.\nCommenting on Google delaying the removal of cookies,\u00a0Iv\u00e1n Markman, Chief Business Officer at Yahoo said,\u00a0\"The\u00a0future of identity lies in the ability to leverage direct, consumer-consented sources and to be smarter about signals that are not attached to a consumer's\u00a0identity.

        "raw_content": "Topics: The new Privacy Sandbox proposal for interest-based advertising\nChrome recently announced an updated Privacy Sandbox proposal called Topics to support interest-based advertising and help businesses connect with potential customers in a more private way. This new API replaces the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) proposal.\nThe Privacy Sandbox is a collaborative initiative to build new privacy-preserving technologies as an alternative to third-party cookies. The goal is to improve user privacy while preserving the vitality of the open web by supporting key marketing use cases for online businesses. Chrome has incorporated feedback from the industry to improve upon the initial FLoC proposal, and we found that we can make interest-based advertising more private with our new proposal, Topics.\nWith Topics API, a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s browser determines a handful of topics such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beauty & Fitness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Running & Walking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that represent their top interests for the previous week based on their browsing activity. When a user visits a participating site, the API will share up to three topics\u00e2\u20ac\u201done from each of the past three weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith websites and their advertising partners who can use it as one of many potential signals for interest-based advertising.

        "raw_content": "Android Police\nHere's everything Google showed off at CES 2024\nIf you want to know what Google thinks of the future of mobile, this is your chance\nYou're never going to find Google announcing new gadgets at CES \u2014 we'll have to wait a few more months for I/O before we see hardware \u2014 but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a big presence in Vegas. In addition to covering the city in AI-themed billboards and decking the monorail out with everyone's favorite Bugdroid, Google's CES booth is basically a shrine to its vision of the future of mobile computing. In addition to demoing its latest announcements for Auto, casting, and more, the company made sure to deliver demos of all of its AI tricks. Whether or not that made us into true believers of the tech, however, remains to be seen.\nThere are plenty of photos to be seen here covering every section of Google's booth, and I won't blame any reader who wants to skip over my thoughts to see what the brand's identity at CES looks like. But for those interested in a guided tour, Android Police hit the scene for a walkthrough. Located across the street from the north hall entrance to the Las Vegas Convention Center \u2014 a building nearly impossible to get to in the day one traffic throughout the city \u2014 Google's \"booth\" is really more of a small village. Check out this map to get a good idea of what we walked through.\nMore Creating, More Doing, More Exploring, More Everything \u2014 despite each building being named with a separate theme, the actual demos within each space weren't quite as cohesive as you'd imagine. We kicked off our journey at the More Everything tent, which focused on Google's ever-growing ecosystem of products, partners, and accessories. From a wall of Samsung devices to a focus on casting \u2014 including Fast Pair improvements and Tap to Cast, both announced not long after we arrived \u2014 it was a good start.\nIt was also one of the only places in Google's booth where AI's presence wasn't felt, and frankly, I think that was for the best. While the AI demos I'll highlight in a moment primarily consisted of guided walkthroughs we'd previously seen of the last year's worth of software features, Tap to Cast was perhaps the only demo that left me impressed. Not only did it function perfectly in an environment where it seemed all but guaranteed to run into technical difficulties \u2014 just think about how overloaded networks around LVCC are \u2014 but I was able to test it myself, no handholding required.\nThis building was also where we spotted the main hardware theme of Google's CES booth: foldables. This building featured nearly every major Android foldable built around a large display area, while nearly every other demo throughout the enclosure used a Galaxy Z Fold 5, OnePlus Open, or even Motorola Razr+ to showcase certain AI features. It really seemed like Google only relied on the Pixel 8 Pro when it needed to; for everything else, the company was happy to rely on a phone from one of its partners, particularly if the device folded in half.\nFrankly, the other three halls \u2014 More Creating, More Doing, and More Exploring \u2014 weren't quite as impressive as the first. Google showed off all sorts of AI demos for features you've been hearing about for months. Immersive View in Maps, SGE, and Bard showcases filled the More Exploring building, and while I've made my thoughts on Google's attempts at battling OpenAI well-known at this point, this was my first time seeing Immersive View in action. The ability to explore the space around landmarks like the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, even if I'm missing the full impact of how this would help me have a better time as a tourist.\nAt the very least, the Bard exhibit \u2014 now featuring Google's new extensions \u2014 was pretty great. Despite a slow connection, the ability to automatically pull data from Docs and Sheets was something we could agree would've been mighty useful for events like these. It was all too easy to imagine pulling up your CES schedule from a spreadsheet without having to work around data from your co-workers. Not bad.\nThe More Creating building left us pretty cold. Google's AI wallpapers remain a gimmick that every other Android OEM seems dead set on replicating, and Magic Compose continues to be locked to preset conversations that seem custom-built to get it right on every try. Also, Google's insistence on using a (bad) Shakespearean bot to enhance your messages will never not leave me befuddled.\nFinally, while the More Doing tent did contain a few explanations of Google's recent additions to Duet AI in Workspace and improvements to Call Screen, it paled in comparison to the AI-themed jukebox with some truly terrible puns.\nAnd, naturally, every single element of Google's booth was tricked out in Android-themed decorations. From Android 14 road signs to collections of Bugdroids scattered along the walls, the entire setup was, at least visually speaking, a total masterpiece. We even got Android-themed pins, stickers, and temporary tattoos just for swinging by.\nA few missing elements left me pretty surprised. Considering how excited Google seems to be about Gemini \u2014 and how it's effectively the engine powering its next lineup of AI tools \u2014 its absence here was conspicuous. Both of the current Gemini Nano applications are pretty disappointing, though, offering a slow start to Pixel's on-device LLMs, so I suppose it makes some amount of sense. To completely avoid talking about Gemini, however, seemed like a bit of a miss to me, even in a more consumer-focused space.\nUnfortunately, our other CES appointments left us unable to check out the final showcase: Android in the Car. Despite signing up for a slot while touring the rest of the booths, we were still fifteenth in line when it came to leave. Google's demos were built around both Android Auto's new battery information sharing in Maps and its focus on delivering full app experiences in (parked) cars, but unfortunately, we'll have to wait for another time to get a hands-on with either service. Considering the limited scope of both tools though, we'll have plenty of time to see both in action at future events, including MWC and I/O, before they meaningfully roll out to drivers.\nBig gallery time!\nWhile Google is undoubtedly holding back its most exciting announcements for later this year (Pixel Fold 2 when?) it still did its best to go all-out for its CES booth. If AI is the company's play for the future, that was on full display at this year's show. That said, the sheer amount of apps it touched \u2014 Maps! Workspace! Messaging! Wallpapers! \u2014 made it feel a little too much like Google's throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the less successful tools start to fall to the wayside as Google figures out its strategy from here on out.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nWill is the Phones Editor at Android Police, which means he usually has a dozen different smartphones on his desk at any given time.

        "raw_content": "On January 4, 2024, Google announced its plan to turn off third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, as part of a gradual phase-out aiming for full removal by the end of the year. Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox project, first introduced in 2019, entails collaboration among industry players to allow advertising without invading user privacy. Let\u2019s explore the measures and guidelines Google has announced so far and how we can prepare for the upcoming challenges.\nWhat\u2019s Changing?\nGoogle Sandbox centers on two pillars across the web and apps on Android The most significant change on the web is the deprecation of third-party cookies. At the same time, Android is limiting tracking through advertising ID (Google Advertising ID, GAID) which was used as a user identifier, to build a safe web/ app environment.\nThe bottom line, however, is that the changes you\u2019ll see in your business right now aren\u2019t as significant as you might think. Especially, when it comes to attribution performance measurement in Airbridge. Installs via Google Play Install Referrer will still be recorded, and deep link and web UTM parameters will still be available. Based on this, the cross-platform identifier (Airbridge ID) that Airbridge uses for performance measurement is still available.\nNevertheless, it is important to note what will be affected and how you can specifically prepare for it.\nWhat does the deprecation of third-party cookies mean?\nCookies are small pieces of data that are stored when a user visits a website. Third-party cookies are a collection of data stored by a third-party service other than the owner of the website the user visited. The advertising industry has been able to use this information to track a single user across multiple web browsers and show a customized ad to that user. It was these third-party cookies that allowed products you searched for on the website to later pop up as channel ads on other social networks or platforms. However, privacy concerns emerged due to the collection of user behavior on websites without their consent, leading to the decision to discontinue support by 2024.\nGAID deprecation on Android\nAndroid is also planning to cease support for the Google Advertising ID (GAID), a user identifier. Fortunately, you can still leverage Google Play Install Referrer or identifiers that MMPs like Airbridge use to measure performance. However, considering GAIDs have long been used for user tracking in Android apps and have played an important role in assessing performance, it is now time to begin exploring alternative methods for evaluating ad effectiveness.\nWhat Google suggests\u2026\nShow relevant content and ads - Topics & Protected Audience API\nGoogle plans to provide the following alternative measures in the form of APIs for the digital advertising industry, which is facing the need for new methods due to significant changes.\nWhile unique identifiers have traditionally been used to understand user behavior and infer their interests, the Topics API helps you acquire new users through ad targeting based on their recent interest-based history within a browser or app. Among approximately 400 officially designated subjects of interest, or \u2018topics\u2019, machine learning assigns appropriate topic categories to users based on their search and visit history. If a user frequently visits travel-related websites, travel will be on the user\u2019s list of topics. Topics are only kept for 3 weeks, after which they are deleted. Of course, categories related to personal information such as gender and race are not collected. When the publisher calls the Topics API, three topics are randomly selected and shared. Google ensures user anonymity by only sharing general interests rather than analyzing granular user behavior patterns. Beyond that, the Topics API gives users maximum control. You can see which topics have been assigned to you, delete topics you\u2019re not interested in, or even disable the Topics API feature altogether. These features help safeguard your privacy while allowing publishers and advertisers to continue personalizing digital ads to new users.\nGoogle also offers a Protected Audience API that allows advertisers to serve remarketing using custom audiences. To enhance user privacy, audiences will be generated and stored directly on the device or browser, eliminating the dependence on unique identifiers or third-party cookies currently in use. To delve into how Protected Audience API works, advertisers and publishers (DSPs) will predefine interest groups along with specific behaviors (like add to cart, and purchase) for their campaigns. When a user triggers the action, the Protected Audience API is called, adding that user to the custom audience. When a user visits an advertising site (SSP or the site itself) or a publisher app later, the Protected Audience API is called, and ad bidding is conducted based on the previously created audiences to serve the most relevant ads to the user. This enhances the safety of remarketing since the device or browser, rather than a third party, possesses information about the user's interests. Moreover, ad bidding is executed on the device without any external leakage.\nMeasure digital ads - Attribution Reporting API\nTraditional Advertising IDs and third-party cookies have also played a key role in measuring ad performance. These identifiers allow you to match users who were exposed to your ads with users who generated conversions within your web/app. It gives you a bird's-eye view of the effectiveness of campaigns on various channels and the number of users they brought in. To help you with this aspect, Google offers an alternative way to measure ad performance with the Attribution Reporting API.\nHere\u2019s how the Attribution Reporting API works: When a user views or clicks on an ad within a web/app, the Attribution Reporting API stores the corresponding touchpoint event. If a conversion occurs, such as when the user installs an app or makes a purchase on the web, the conversion event is also saved. The Attribution Reporting API then associates the last touchpoints that occurred before that conversion to calculate attribution. This looks similar to the traditional last-touch attribution model, but the difference is that the process of storing touchpoints and attributing them all takes place within the user\u2019s device or browser.\nOnce attribution is calculated within the device (or browser), the Attribution Reporting API provides two types of reports: Event-level reports and Summary reports. These reports are delayed and are sent with a certain percentage of noise included in the data to protect user privacy.\nThe event-level report is a report provided for ad optimization purposes by measuring performance for each conversion event. In this report, you can check \u2018which conversion event occurred by which campaign in which app\u2019 through the three pieces of information below.\nSummary reports aggregate the performance of multiple ads, enabling analysis from various perspectives. Aggregation Keys, which are ad campaign and conversion-related criteria, can be defined in advance on the publisher and MMP sides.\u00a0 Ad performance then can be analyzed based on that information.\nThere are two main components of Summary Reports.\nFor instance, by configuring Aggregation Key items on the publisher side, such as campaign, ad group, creative, and targeting region, and on the MMP side, items corresponding to conversions like product category, device information, and app version, you can view results like 'A total of 300 purchases were made by A campaign on B app, and the total purchase amount was 5 million won. Half of the purchases were in the Seoul area.'\nHowever, as you can see from the name of the report, you cannot receive a report for each event; instead, reports are generated after events with the same properties accumulate to a certain level. Therefore, in order to create the largest possible parameter, it is recommended to compose the Aggregation key with general items.\nHow to prepare for the changes ahead\nWe have already ceased collecting iOS advertising identifiers through Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. Adapting to new changes, as we learned from that experience, is never easy but challenges can create new opportunities. In the case of Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox, alternative suggestions were released beforehand, and industry players are improving the project based on beta test feedback. We anticipate a more stable and smooth transition this time as we have been preparing in advance.\nWhat should advertisers know beforehand?\nIf GAID support is discontinued on Android, we will see lower installs and conversions compared to before, as the identifier that links ad clicks and in-app conversions will no longer be available. However, as mentioned above, attributions matched through the Play Store Install Referrer will still be recorded.\nIf your organization is building internal user data based on the current Advertising ID, the following tasks are recommended.\nIf Chrome discontinues support for third-party cookies, sharing attribution results for subdomains may not be possible. For example, if you are using multiple subdomains and sharing attribution results from each site, this functionality will no longer be supported. (Attribution results from site a.ab180.co will not be associated with b.ab180.co)\nPrepare for Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox with Airbridge\nAs an App Attribution Partner (AAP) with Google, Airbridge is currently beta testing the Attribution Reporting API with the Google Ads team. Additionally,\u00a0 we are internally evaluating various features of the Privacy Sandbox.\nFurthermore, we are actively working on implementing new attribution methods supported by major publishers to enhance user privacy, such as Google\u2019s Google Click Identifier (GCLID) and gBraid, as well as Meta\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement (AEM)). Simultaneously, we are exploring diverse strategies to address the industry\u2019s needs as an MMP.\nAirbridge is dedicated to delivering the fastest and most personalized service to the industry in alignment with the impending changes. For any updates on Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox and advice on your future marketing strategy, our team of marketing experts at Airbridge is ready to assist. We are happy to provide more information on the upcoming changes and insights on how to tackle new challenges."

        "raw_content": "No offers found\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nGoogle's plan to rid the web of third-party cookies pushed for late 2024\nThe Privacy Sandbox initiative for Chrome has been delayed for another two years.\nWhat you need to know\nThe Privacy Sandbox from Google is the company's effort to block third-party cookies on Chrome. Intending to build a private web, the search giant first introduced this concept in 2019. A year after, it announced that it plans to take it live by 2022. And, here we are in 2022, where Google is still seen illustrating its plans on testing and making the Privacy Sandbox available for the web by 2024.\nIn a new blog post, Google says it has been releasing trial versions of new Privacy Sandbox APIs in the Chrome browser to developers for testing purposes. The processes included refining design proposals on inputs from the developers' community, publishers, marketers, and regulators through forums like W3C.\nGoogle also highlights an agreement reached earlier this year to work with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which will provide input on how Google implements and releases these new Privacy Sandbox features.\nHowever, the feedback Google has received on its proposals suggests that the company needs more time to test and evaluate the Privacy Sandbox's technologies before removing third-party cookies on Chrome.\n\"This feedback aligns with our commitment to the CMA to ensure that the Privacy Sandbox provides effective, privacy-preserving technologies and the industry has sufficient time to adopt these new solutions,\" says Anthony Chaves, VP of Privacy Sandbox. \"This deliberate approach to transitioning from third-party cookies ensures that the web can continue to thrive, without relying on cross-site tracking identifiers or covert techniques like fingerprinting.\"\nWhile developers are given the ability to test the new Privacy Sandbox APIs on Chrome starting this week, Google plans to expand to more users globally from early next month and into early 2023.\nUsers added to the trial will be notified with a prompt allowing them to opt-out if they so choose, Google says. Meanwhile, the tests and feedback from the developer community will continue to make room for improvements.\nThe big picture from Google is to phase out all third-party cookies by the second half of 2024, starting with Chrome. With another two years of a target in mind, Google expects to release the Privacy Sandbox APIs for developers by Q3 2023 so that they can adapt to these APIs on Chrome.\nA developer preview introduced Privacy Sandbox for Android devices early this year.\nFor those interested, Google also provides a timeline to track the progress and plans. The company further states that it is \"grateful to be working with companies across the industry who are invested in developing privacy-first experiences on the web, and will be testing Privacy Sandbox in the coming months.\"\nChrome is one of the prominent browsers when it comes to laptops, desktops, and some of the best Chromebooks available out there. It even takes a significant position considering the Android browsers in the Google Play Store. The Privacy Sandbox is a unique solution to block large-scale cookies that undermine people's privacy with hidden techniques, including fingerprinting and cross-site tracking, to name a few.\nBe an expert in 5 minutes\nGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android\nVishnu works as a freelance News Writer for Android Central.

        "raw_content": "Pocket-lint\n6 new features Google just announced at CES 2024\nHere's everything Google announced at CES - its latest answer to Apple AirDrop, EV battery predictions for Android Auto, Chromecast upgrades, and more\nKey Takeaways\nGoogle is in between hardware launches at CES 2024, but it has been taking to these trade shows to demonstrate its studious technocrat role in maintaining the peace around Android and its associated platforms. And while we could talk about the company's amazing funhouse-esque booths at these conferences, we'll keep to a few feature announcements that should bring continuity when you're dealing with devices of all sorts back at home.\nTVs tend to take up the most space at CES, so it's only fitting for Google to drop some new sorcery on that front. Here's everything it announced during the Vegas show.\n1\nFair Pair on Chromecast with Google TV\nLink earbuds up with just a click of your remote\nFor starters, those with a Chromecast with Google TV will be able to use Fast Pair when a software update drops next month. If you've got a couple of earbuds, some headphones, even a phone or Chromebook in pairing mode, you'll see that device pop up on your TV screen and you'll be able to link them up with just a click of your remote control. As a reminder, your device will need to support Bluetooth Low Energy and have Android Location Services enabled to use Fast Pair.\n2\nCast TikToks to Google TV devices\nStarting January 9\nCasting is a big deal if you're looking to share photos and clips from your phone with a whole bunch of people in a room at once -- that's what a TV is for, right? Well, Google has announced that you'll be able to cast TikTok to Google TV devices starting today. The company does lean heavily into \"Chromecast built-in\" as a term of art in its blog post on The Keyword, but you should be able to cast TikToks to any Cast-compatible display; Google created and maintains the underlying Cast protocol.\n3\nMatter for Google TV devices\nPlus some Android TV devices and future LG TVs\nFinally, if you're looking forward to Matter unifying your smart home situation, Google says to expect future LG TVs as well as some existing Google TV and Android TV devices to be able to act as hub devices that can help you control all of your appliances via Google Home's various interfaces.\n4\nPixel Tablet seamless switching\nExpected to come later this year\nShrinking down from TVs, the Pixel Tablet will gain the ability to carry on playing whatever you're streaming from Spotify or YouTube Music on your Pixel phone when you come home for the day. This seemingly simple switch is expected to come later this year, which is probably why we're seeing a mock-up and not a screenshot of the finalized feature.\n5\nEV battery predictions\nFord Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning get support first\nAlso coming down the road, literally, is EV battery predictions on head units running Google Maps with Android Auto. Drivers who own a Ford Mustang Mach-E or F-150 Lightning will be the first to receive handy information on what their charges will be after a planned trip, how long a charge might take, and where they might want to charge.\n6\nNearby Share becomes Quick Share\nAnswer to Apple's AirDrop\nLast, but not least, a merging of families with regards to wireless file sharing: Google is renaming Nearby Share, its answer to Apple's AirDrop, to Quick Share -- the name Samsung took for the exact same feature that Galaxy phone owners are used to seeing. With this move, all Android users will be seeing a new logo tied with the Quick Share name, but they'll still be able to perform the exact same function as they have for years: link up with Android and ChromeOS devices through Bluetooth and share files over a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection. And support is expected to expand with LG and other manufacturers working on bringing their Windows PCs into the Quick Share ecosystem.\nSubscribe to the Pocket-lint Newsletter!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nJules joined the Pocket-lint team in 2023 as part of our news team.

We have lots of lists summing up the best TVs, best laptops, best robots, best headphones, best mobile accessories, and more.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nBut we also wanted to give you a list of our absolute top picks from CES that we think will be most worth your hard-earned money when they launch in 2024. And naturally, we also wanted to highlight the best innovations -- products that you may not buy but are worth knowing about because they could influence other products that you may want to bring into your life in the future. So here they are.\nSamsung S95D OLED: Best TV\nTV innovation was everywhere at CES 2024 with transparent TVs, over 100-inch QLEDs, folding TVs, and 8K projectors. But the best TV of the show had a more subtle upgrade that will have a much bigger impact on the quality of the everyday viewing experience. The Samsung S95D OLED TV unveiled a glare-free display that offers the best qualities of anti-reflective screens while maintaining the intense colors and excellent dynamic range that make OLED the top technology for picture quality. We tested the glare-free display with an intense phone camera flash and were amazed at how well it dispersed the light. This means that you can now use this TV in the brightest rooms -- one of the biggest challenges for OLED TVs. I'm confident that will give this the TV with the best picture quality on the market when it launches this spring. It will likely cost around $2,500, until it gets discounted around Black Friday.\nSamsung S95D\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid: Best laptop\nWe've tested and seen plenty of 2-in-1 computers at ZDNET, but there's none quite like Lenovo's new ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. That's because this is the world's first 2-in-1 Windows PC and Android tablet, meaning as you detach the 14-inch OLED display from the keyboard, the device automatically converts into the Android operating system. On top of that, you can still connect the bottom keyboard portion of the 2-in-1 to an external monitor, giving you, essentially, two computers to work with.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub: Best AI device\nIn the past year, we have seen major leaps in the AI space, which led to a boom in translation technology at CES. The TimeKettle X1 made delivers real-time translations in up to 40 languages, with nearly no latency and high accuracy, which I got the chance to experience myself. The device itself fits in the palm of your and includes a screen that displays transcriptions of your conversation and two earbuds that two people can wear for real-time in-ear translations during a one-on-one conversation. There are a series of modes, making it ideal for every situation you may need a translation. If you sync different hubs, it can provide real-time translations for up to 20 people in five different languages, aimed for use in classrooms and meetings. The product is already available for $699 on the TimeKettle website.\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub\nMSI Claw: Best gaming device\nIn what is becoming one of the hottest product categories in recent years, the Taiwanese computer maker's first gaming handheld impresses with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor for AI enhancements to performance and gaming, a more ergonomic design (with plenty of ventilation) than its competition, and USB-C Thunderbolt support for external monitor use. The LCD display falls short to its OLED rivals, but the gaming potential of this handheld should more than compensate for it. It will start at $699 and arrive later this year.\nMSI Claw\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: Best tech accessory\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar offers the same types of insights a fitness tracker for humans would. You place the attachment on your dog's collar and on the app you will have access to data about your dog's heart health, activity, appetite, and more. The attachment can also track your dog's location, eliminating the need for additional trackers such as AirTags. One of the most important features is its ability to detect early symptoms of heart disease, potentially saving your dog's life. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category since it is through AI that the collar can detect your dog's activities, such as sleeping, walking, and more. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar is already available for $99, and it requires a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar\nHoloconnect Holobox: Best innovation overall\nThe Holoconnect Holobox makes it possible to talk to someone via a hologram with near-zero latency. It's a \"plug and play\" system, so all you need to do is plug it in and connect it to the internet to get started. To be a hologram yourself, you need a white background that is well-lit, and then you can carry on like it is a regular video call. It is already available for consumer use, and we even saw Google use the Holobox to showcase its Android characters in fun and innovative ways at CES 2024. The price is not disclosed on the Holoconnect website, but interested customers can request a pricing list. It's very expensive and most people aren't going to want to put this phone booth sized box in their living room, but the idea of video calls of the future becoming holograms is super compelling.\nHoloconnect Holobox\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV: Best TV innovation\nThe recent trend in Laser TV and ultra short throw (UST) projectors has spawned a wave of interest in 100-inch and 120-inch screens to create a more cinema-like experience at home. At CES, Samsung even unveiled an 8K projector that goes up to 150 inches. The challenge with these projectors is that they're never going to have the same level of dynamic range, brightness, or color intensity as today's best OLED and QLED TVs. TCL had an answer to that at CES with the announcement of its 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV. We were highly impressed with the picture quality of this QLED display in a private demo. It's an extension of TCL's QM8 series, which ZDNET and others have rated as one of the best TVs on the market. The TCL 115QM891G (the official product name) kicks it up a notch with 5,000 nits of brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones to drive excellent dynamic range and sharp colors. Pricing wasn't announced but it will likely cost around $20,000 and it will be available at Best Buy. That makes it an ultra-premium purchase, but if you have the space and the budget then you can now get a projector-level screen size with the benefits of the latest advances in QLED picture quality.\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV\nRabbit: Best AI innovation\nWhat if AI assistants could do more than just give you the best search results and leave you to do the rest? What if they could book an Airbnb for you, shop for groceries online and checkout, or start a return for that impulsive Black Friday purchase? That's what the folks at Rabbit are touting with R1, its new $199 pocket device that operates on a \"Large Action Model\". Made in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the R1 may be the first of many AI hardware releases in 2024. The ball is now in the court of the world's biggest tech giants to deliver superior voice assistant experiences to match the capabilities of what Rabbit has come up with.\nRabbit R1\nSony XR headset: Best VR/AR innovation\nSony gave us the biggest shocker of CES 2024 in the opening keynote of the show when it partnered with Siemens to unveil an XR headset with high-end specs and an attractive Sony design. While this headset has the oomph to compete with Apple Vision Pro, it's not aimed at a general consumer audience but is focused directly on professionals, engineers, and designers to help them accelerate product development and create spatial content experiences that could ultimately run on Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and other headsets and smart glasses. This product will have the potential to save a lot of time and resources for companies in flying people around the globe or shipping prototypes to collaborate on and finalize their products. They'll do this by creating \"digital twins\" in virtual spaces such as Siemens NX Immersive Designer. Sony won't sell the headset as a standalone device, but it will be bundled with Siemens' platform and other software packages for specific industries. That will include an entertainment industry bundle that Sony wants to use to empower the next generation of digital storytellers to build immersive 3D experiences.\nSony XR headset\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024"

        "raw_content": "Google in Europe\nThe path forward with the Privacy Sandbox\nFeb 11, 2022\nmin read\nGoogle\u2019s aim with the Privacy Sandbox is to improve web privacy for people around the world, while also giving publishers, creators and other developers the tools they need to build thriving businesses. This includes building new digital advertising tools, in collaboration with the wider industry, to replace third-party cookies with alternatives that better protect consumer privacy and preserve peoples\u2019 access to free content online.\nSince announcing the Privacy Sandbox we have been in open dialogue with the industry, consumer advocates and regulators to gather feedback on this initiative. Over the past year, we have also worked closely with the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), including on a set of legally-binding commitments to address the CMA\u2019s competition concerns over the Privacy Sandbox which will govern how we will design and implement this initiative. The aim, through this regulatory oversight and supervision, is to provide reassurance that the Privacy Sandbox will protect consumers and support a competitive ad-funded web, and not favor Google.\nThe commitments address these concerns through three main principles. First, the changes we will make in Chrome in the context of the Privacy Sandbox initiative will apply in the same way to Google\u2019s advertising products as to products from other companies. Second, we will design, develop and implement Privacy Sandbox with regulatory oversight and input from the CMA and the ICO. And third, we will inform the CMA in advance of our intention to remove third-party cookies and agree to wait for their feedback on whether any competition law concerns remain.\nPrivacy by design and by default have been at the heart of the Privacy Sandbox from the outset, and we are also intent on ensuring that the new tools meet the requirements set out in the recent ICO\u2019s Opinion on Data protection and privacy expectations for online advertising proposals. To that end, we are designing these new tools to avoid cross-site tracking, provide people with better transparency and control, and result in better outcomes for people and businesses on the web. We look forward to further engagement with data protection authorities as we continue to iterate and improve on the proposals.\nWe\u2019re pleased that today the CMA has accepted these commitments, which now go into immediate effect. The development and implementation criteria that underpin these commitments are summarized below, and can be found in full on the CMA\u2019s website. We will apply the commitments globally because we believe that they provide a roadmap for how to address both privacy and competition concerns in this evolving sector.\nRespecting user privacy while maintaining a well functioning ad-funded web\nGoogle\u2019s objectives in developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals are to make the web more private and secure for people, while:\nWe recognize that many publishers and advertisers rely on online advertising to fund their websites and reach new customers. So building tools which aim to improve people\u2019s privacy, while continuing to support advertising, is key to keeping the web open and accessible to everyone and allowing businesses of all sizes to succeed.\nDeveloping the Privacy Sandbox\nTo achieve the objectives above, Google is committing to designing, developing and implementing the Privacy Sandbox proposals taking into account specific criteria agreed with the CMA:\nBuilding on many months of open consultation by Google \u2014 and the CMA \u2014 with the wider industry, Google will be consulting with the CMA and ICO on a regular basis in relation to the design, development and implementation of the Privacy Sandbox (including testing and public announcements). Google will also increase its engagement with industry stakeholders (including publishers, advertisers and ad tech providers) by providing a systematic feedback process to take on board reasonable views and suggestions. This continues our previous engagement with web community members, who are encouraged to participate in the development and testing of the proposed new technologies through public discussion forums like the W3C, developer channels such as GitHub, industry groups and origin trials. We will also establish a dedicated microsite, available from privacysandbox.com, explaining these channels in more detail and offering a new feedback form to submit suggested use cases and API feature requests, by the end of February 2022.\nEnsuring compliance\nGoogle will work with the CMA to resolve concerns without delay and consult and update the CMA and the ICO on an ongoing basis. Google has also committed to appoint an independent Monitoring Trustee who will have the access and technical expertise needed to ensure compliance, having consulted with the CMA. The Monitoring Trustee will work directly with the CMA, and will be central in ensuring compliance with the data and non-discrimination commitments offered by Google.\nWe believe that these commitments will ensure that competition continues to thrive while providing flexibility in designing the Privacy Sandbox APIs in a way that will improve peoples\u2019 privacy online. Helping businesses adapt to a privacy-safe web, through invention and collaboration, can help provide the foundation for long-term economic sustainability and growth.\nThis process requires close engagement with competition and privacy regulators and new ways of working together. We hope these commitments can contribute to that new framework.\nRelated stories\nLast year the European Union enacted a new regulation called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which applies to companies who have been designated as \u201cGatekeepers.\u201d These n\u2026\nLet\u2019s stay in touch.

        "raw_content": "Android Police\nGoogle's next-gen privacy toolkit hits real Android 13 hardware for the first time\nIt's been a long time coming and we've got a long way to go with Privacy Sandbox\nGoogle makes the bulk of its money by selling and placing ads that are relevant to the users of its platforms whether it's Search, Chrome, or Android. The company has been under pressure to protect the privacy of its users while conducting its business. The process hasn't been easy \u2014 its initial replacement for tracking cookies was crushed under public scrutiny \u2014 and target dates have been moved back multiple times. Today marks a positive milestone, though, as Google is launching its Privacy Sandbox beta for Android.\nPrivacy Sandbox, the tech giant's next-gen toolkit for handling users' browsing data for ad personalization, came to Chrome as a beta in late March last year. It was also put on Android as a developer preview \u2014 those who wanted to try out the new APIs and SDKs had to use an emulator. These include an enriched Advertising IDs scheme plus the all-new Topics API which is meant to replace cookies, the new FLEDGE API that's meant to handle ad placements, and the SDK Runtime to let app code run separate from ad code, among others.\nThe beta will allow app developers who have signed up for it back in November to try the new sandbox tools on their apps with real hardware running Android 13. A small percentage of signees will get the opportunity first via notification on their devices, but the pool will grow with time. The Privacy Sandbox developer preview for Android, now on its seventh iteration, will continue on with fast-tracked updates compared to the beta.\nGoogle hopes it can have its Privacy Sandbox for both Android and Chrome battle-tested and ready for a public launch by 2024.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nJules joined the Android Police team in 2019.
