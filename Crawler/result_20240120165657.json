I'm Casio,the product Engineering from\u00c2\u00a0Shenzhen Ruitai.Today's post is about the\u00c2\u00a0CNC Turning Parts. #cncturning\nCNC (Computerized Numerical Control) turning technique is basically a technique that is used to make turned parts.The process starts by working on the bars of the material. After that, a piece of material is treated in order to remove the material and to create the desired shape. #machining\nOur company has a\u00c2\u00a0wealth of experience\u00c2\u00a0in this aspect with a range of materials,from plastic and metal to wood,and more... #experience\nThese followings are telling you why you should choose it:\nHigh precision,the tolerance CNC turning parts can reach 0.01MM.\u00c2\nCNC turning parts surface finish can be Ra0.8.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\nShort Production time,CNC turning parts can be arrange delivery within one week.\u00c2\nChoose CNC turning parts can reduce initial investment and reduce high mold cost.\nDuring CNC Turning parts production,Mid-term design changes are convenient. #advantages\nIf you want to know more details, view:https://lnkd.in/greQczk.\nCustom CNC Turning&Milling Parts from Prototyping to Production\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nSenior Product Engineer at Shenzhen Ruitai Mold Technology Co.,Ltd\nHello,everyone!

I simply shared a small video with you. Then it introduces the process of electing and voting for Olympic venues and how Olympic MEDALS are made. I have to say that Japan is very good at recycling. The choice of mascots for the Games was particularly interesting, as they were chosen by Japanese primary school students, who are worthy of being represented by cute cartoon characters.\nFinally, I also introduce some controversial things about the Olympic Games. For example, there were claims that the Olympics might be canceled because of the pandemic, leading to disputes over tickets and money. The second point is that people are selling Olympic volunteers' clothes at exorbitant prices on websites. The third point is about the waste of food. Although we live in a happy age, we still need to uphold the Chinese tradition of cherishing the virtue of food.\nThe above is today's activities in our company, looking forward to Ruitai can find more meaningful activities.\n\u00c2\u00a0#recycling #olympics2020 #sports\nThe 2020 Olympic Games\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nSenior Product Engineer at Shenzhen Ruitai Mold Technology Co.,Ltd\nIn the last post, I introduced our company's products to you, this time I'd like to introduce our company's\u00c2\u00a0significant advantages\u00c2\u00a0to you. #advantages\nAs one of the leading prototype manufactures in China, we have been in this line for\u00c2\u00a015 years. #15years\nGood Order Procedure #procedure\nThe processes are:Signed NDA - Confirm plans-Design and selection-Product forming-Quality control and delivery.\nGood Certification System #certificacion\nWhich can meet customers in different countries about the environment&quality control.\nGood QC System #QC\nAfter production,we 'll test every part in professional tools.\nGood Surface Finish #surface\nWe have some skilled experts who only handle finishing assignments so the quality of your products are of exceptional quality.\nGood delivery #deliver\nRuitai has unique package team to ensure all goods in flawless when customers get their parts.\nIf you want to know more about it, view:https://lnkd.in/g4xi7Ke\nLooking forward we can cooperation with each other in the near future. #china\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nSenior Product Engineer at Shenzhen Ruitai Mold Technology Co.,Ltd\nThe weather in Shenzhen is always so hot.

Reduce the number of clamping times, try to use the combination of fixtures and other basic processing technology details, to minimize the machining error caused by iron filings on aluminum parts, because the aluminum parts are very soft, the excluded iron filings can easily cause machining errors in aluminum parts. . For example, in the FANUC or Central China Machining Center, the deep hole should be used as much as possible with the G83 command, so that the iron filings can be discharged instead of the G73 command.\n2. Cutting three elements: cutting speed vc, feed rate f, cutting depth ap and tool compensation\nIn simple terms, under the premise of ensuring the processing quality and tool wear, the adjustment parameters fully exert the cutting performance of the tool, so that the cutting efficiency is the highest and the processing cost is the lowest.\nIn the CNC lathe, there are also factors such as cutter head wear compensation.\n3. Tool setting\nInaccurate tool setting is also a factor in size error. Therefore, try to choose a good edge finder. If the machine has an automatic tool aligner, it is better.\nPrecision Aluminum Prototype With Cnc Machined\nPrecision Aluminum prototype with CNC machined\nCNC Anodized Aluminum Prototype,Aluminum Metal Prototype\nCutting - sawing, shearing, or chiseling (manual and automatic); torching and CNC laser, milling or water jet cutting\nPRODUCTDESCRIPTION\nCNC metal work includes:\n-Cutting - sawing, shearing, or chiseling (manual and automatic); torching and CNC laser, milling or water jet cutting\n-Bending\n-Assembly - welding, adhesive binding, or crimping.\nStainless Steel:SS201,301, 304, 316, 17-4PH, SS303, SSs304, SS316 etc.\n(Polishing Plating Sandblasting Laser engraving)\nSteel:Q235, 20#, 45# 40cr 416Stainless iron etc.\n(Blackened, Zinc/Nickel/Chrome plating,Carburized Hot treatment)\nAluminum: Q235, 20#, 45# 40cr 416Stainless iron etc.\n(Natural/Hard anodize,Powder coating,Sandblasting,Plating Brushing,Polishing,Laser engraving)\nHome Appliance Model With 3D Painted\nHome appliance model with 3D painted\nSLA 3D Printin,Home appliance model with 3D painted Manufacturer\nIn the early stage of prototyping, a 3D data model is built in the computer, which can directly dismantle the parts and components, instead of manual experience, and avoid manual omission through intuitive and visual electronic supervision.PRODUCT\u00c2\u00a0DESCRIPTION\nThere are two main advantages to using 3D printing:\n1. Shorten the production cycle and improve efficiency\nIn the early stage of prototyping, a 3D data model is built in the computer, which can directly dismantle the parts and components, instead of manual experience, and avoid manual omission through intuitive and visual electronic supervision.\nManual corrections can take hours or even days of work. The prototype can be quickly corrected by electronic adjustment. After the modeling is completed, it can be printed directly. It can be said that the production time is quite saved.\n2, the threshold is low, adapt to the development of modern society\nThe threshold for traditional hand-made production is relatively high, and it requires the styling ability of the prototype. There are also many tricks in the actual production process. For example, \"partition\", it is not only OK to assemble, so is the part beautiful? Late volume capacity cannot be achieved? Many factors, such as the difficulty control of large-scale painting, should be considered.\nThe requirements of 3D modeling relative to pure hand-made are much lower. As long as you can operate 3D software more skillfully and have a certain modeling foundation, you can create a hand through 3D printing. Now it is also because it is relatively high-handed, and it can maximize its advantages in the later stage, and can adapt to the future development needs of the hand-held industry.\nBrass And Copper Prototype With Highly Polished\nBrass and copper prototype with highly polished\nCopper CNC Machining,Custom Brass Cnc Parts\nOur sheet metal rapid prototyping and rapid production services include a variety of tooled and manual manufacturing techniques and processes enabling us to realize some highly complex parts without expensive and time consuming production tooling.\nPRODUCT\u00c2\u00a0DESCRIPTION\nAt our sheet metal workshop we encompass bending, shearing, staking, laser, stamping and wire cutting, as well as CNC punching, CNC folding, drilling, tapping, countersinking and counter boring.
