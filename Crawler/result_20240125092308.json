We've rounded up the nine hi-fi and audio stories that you need to know about right here.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nSonus Faber delivered the wow factor with its new Suprema system, an impressive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 loudspeaker system that\u2019ll set you back \u00a3695,000 / $750,000 for its set up of two speakers, two subwoofers, and one electronic crossover.\nThe company has described the Suprema as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d but the design of the Suprema system remains very much \u2018Sonus Faber\u2019 in its styling.\nThe speakers are 4/5-way designs with eight front-firing speakers in addition to two back-firing drivers, while the subwoofer system uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz.\nAs for the external electronic crossover, it is a dual mono and fully balanced design, with all phase cutting and control circuits purely analogue.\nThe range is available in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes. What isn\u2019t included is a house large enough to keep it in.\nREAD MORE: Sonus Faber marks 40 years with stunning Suprema speaker system, its \u201cmost ambitious project ever\u201d\nFocal Aria Evo X\nA slightly more accessible speaker line up came from Focal, in the shape of its Aria Evo X \u2014 successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nWith speakers covering both traditional stereo and surround sound setups, the range consists of five new models, including the No.1 standmount speakers, the No.2, No.3 and No.4 floorstanders and the Evo X centre speaker.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nYou can pick up this new range now in a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish.\nREAD MORE: Focal's Aria Evo X speaker range could be the stylish home cinema solution you've been searching for\nFiiO R9\nFiiO launched three brand-new products at CES 2024 in Las Vegas (including the CP-13 cassette player \u2014 yes, you read that right), but it was the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC that most caught our eye.\nIt represents an all-round upgrade over last year\u2019s R7, with a larger 6-inch Full HD touchscreen, upgraded components and more than double the power \u2014 now 7300mW, up from 3000mW.\nYou can enjoy 64GB onboard storage and a range of connections, including a new HDMI ARC port alongside the SD, USB, optical, coaxial and ethernet inputs found previously. Headphone users are well catered for too, with a choice of single-ended 6.35mm, balanced 4.4mm, and balanced 4-pin XLR outputs available.\nFrom a wireless perspective, there's Bluetooth 5.0 and 2.4GHz / 5GHz wi-fi capabilities, with support for high-resolution PCM files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512 audio, and MQA decoding. It also supports AirPlay ad DLNA streaming, and is Roon Ready \u2014 plus as it runs on Android you can directly install streaming services like Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify and Qobuz.\nYou can pick it up from mid-January and will cost \u00a31399 / $1499.\nREAD MORE: FiiO\u2019s tech-laden R9 streamer could be the solution to your desktop audio needs\nSennheiser Momentum Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled a trio of new products at CES 2024, but it's the Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds that we're most excited about.\nThe current\u00a0Momentum True Wireless 3\u00a0picked up five stars in our review, but they are coming up to two years old now, and that's starting to show against newer competition.\nPromising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the enhancements you'll find this time round include improved ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and Auracast support \u2014 a new Bluetooth feature that opens up the world of audio sharing between various compatible devices and sources.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThey'll be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nREAD MORE: Sennheiser's triple drop includes a much-anticipated sequel to the Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro added a new flagship speaker to its What Hi-Fi? Award-winning C Series at CES 2024, created with both music and TV sound in mind.\nAll wrapped up in the brand\u2019s signature Scandinavian design, the C20 packs all manner of inputs to make the most of that versatility, including a dedicated line-in, a built-in MM phono stage, and an ARC optical input for your TV.\nThe C20 can also stream music wirelessly up to 24-bit/96kHz via your choice of Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth.\nThere's 190W of power here, plus you can stereo pair a couple of C20s together using the Audio Pro app, or Apple AirPlay 2. There's even a sub-out for more low-end oomph if you need it.\nThe C20 will be available in a choice of soft satin white, stylish grey or classic black from February, and will be priced at \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550.\nREAD MORE: The Audio Pro C20 is an all-in-one speaker solution for your music and movies\nMcIntosh MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier\nAs part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, McIntosh used CES 2024 to announce one of its most powerful amplifiers to date.\nThe new MC2.1KW Monoblock Power Amplifier builds on the legacy of 2005's MC2KW, with a tri-chassis construction and 2000 watts of power to give what McIntosh promises will be \"a new industry standard for power and amplification\".\nSome of its improvements include a large-capacity power supply for better performance of low-end frequencies and improved dynamic headroom, while four bespoke McIntosh heatsinks on each power module ensure efficient heat dissipation for more consistent audio quality.\nFurther enhanced circuit designs with upgraded components and shorter signal paths should also aid sonic performance, as should the MC2.1KW's updated electrical wiring and interconnect cables.\nThe MC2.1KW will be available from January 2024 at authorised dealers for an eye-watering \u00a359,995 / \u20ac64,990 / $50,000.\nREAD MORE: McIntosh's 75th-anniversary monoblock amp aims to set a new industry standard for power\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire was one of four turntables unveiled by the brand at CES 2024, but this one caught our eye for its ability to wirelessly stream gorgeous vinyl sound all around your house.\nIt follows in the footsteps of last year's\u00a0Stream Carbon, which worked with Sonos to do just that. However, the Sapphire adds to this with UPnP and\u00a0Roon\u00a0support too, enabling playback through a whole load more compatible devices, all without the need for any further equipment.\nOf course, there are also gold-plated RCA outputs for traditional wired systems and powered speakers too. Expect it to cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nREAD MORE: The Victrola Stream Sapphire turntable can stream vinyl sound all round your house\nJBL Xtreme 4\nJBL announced the latest iteration of its rugged Bluetooth speaker, the Xtreme 4 \u2014 and this time round, it\u2019s leaning on AI to get the very best sound quality from it.\nThe AI Sound Boost feature sees an AI algorithm analysing your music in real time to optimise what you hear, resulting in a more powerful and less distorted sound.\nThe Xtreme 4 is also one of the first JBL wireless speakers to support\u00a0Auracast.\nIt retains its rugged capabilities, with an IP67 rating, plus a 24-hour battery life, with the ability to use it as a charger for your phone if you\u2019re caught short. You can even replace the battery further down the line if you need to.\nIt\u2019ll cost \u00a3330 / $380 / \u20ac350 when it goes on sale in March.\nREAD MORE: JBL\u2019s Xtreme 4 wireless speaker uses AI to boost sound quality\nRoon Nucleus Titan\nMark this in the \u201cserious hi-fi purchase\u201d column, but Roon used CES 2024 to announce a new flagship server, called the Nucleus Titan.\nLike Roon's previous flagship, the Nucleus Plus, the new Nucleus Titan is a dedicated server/streamer solution that has been optimised to work with Roon's OS to deliver \"bit-perfect playback\" of your hi-res digital music collection to a Roon-compatible hi-fi system.\nWhere the new top-tier server surpasses its predecessor is in performance quality and a self-cooling design with \"silent, fan-less operation\".\nThe Titan also sports two USB-C and two USB-A inputs, along with two audio-only HDMI ports. Its internal storage comes in three sizes: 2TB, 4TB and 8TB. Multiroom audio setups are also supported.\nCosting $3699 before adding storage (and your Roon subscription), this is a something of luxury purchase, to say the least. But if you\u2019re serious about Roon, this is undoubtedly the ultimate partner to the Roon software platform.\nREAD MORE: Roon's Nucleus Titan is the ambitious server of audiophiles' dreams \u2013 and has the price to match\nCheck out all the CES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, hands-on reviews and more\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 creates an immersive new experience that lets your skin do the listening\nThe multisensory technology will revolutionise cinema, theatre, concerts, gaming, meditation and therapy, and offer an affordable home cinema to everyoneLondon, UK \u2014 15th June 2021 \u2013 For over 100 years, we've only used our eyes and ears to watch movies and listen to music, but FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 creates a unique, holistic, immersive listening experience that you can feel as well as hear. It combines full-range high-quality audio with gentle physical sound wave vibration, to add the sensation of touch to any listening experience, be it music, games, television, streaming, meditation, movies, VR or any other sound content. Originally designed and engineered in Finland to help autistic children, the technology solves problems and adds value in many industries.Our sense of touch is amazingly sensitive to sound and has been consistently underused in high-quality audio, until now. FLEXOUND aims to make audio a whole-body experience that enhances quality of life. Unlike loudspeakers that vibrate sound into the air, FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 radiates the vibration through foam, providing a soft, near-field listening experience. Patented FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 technology can be embedded into seats, cushions and anything that is soft and in contact with the body. FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 seat, for example, is the world\u2019s first fully loudspeaker-free cinema concept that transforms any space \u2013 small or large \u2013 into a superior, immersive soundscape and multisensory cinema. Stores, malls, auditoriums, museums, live theatres and concert arenas can all become fully functioning cinemas or gaming stations without any external loudspeakers. At home, you can use it as your office meeting audio instead of loudspeakers, as a gaming station, for sound massage or to enjoy a premium cinema experience from the comfort of your living room. With FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122, You Can Sit Inside the SoundIt creates a personal soundsphere and a deeper focus and immersion into music, stories, relaxation or gaming. The multisensory experience of FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 also enhances the emotions created by the content, enriching art and making it accessible to more people, such as the hearing impaired.Previously, the sound frequencies felt in a cinema would mostly be the thump of the high-powered subwoofers firing sub-bass at you. With FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 you are able to literally feel frequencies up to 500 hertz with your body, and even up to 1,000 hertz with your hands and skin. Because FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 does not rely on far field listening or filling a room with decibels like traditional loudspeakers, sound leakage from room to room is considerably less. FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 provides equal sound quality and the sensation of touch for every person, in every seat. By listening through your skin as well as your ears, you don\u2019t need as many decibels to achieve clarity of speech, and dramatic scores and sound effects won\u2019t ever drown out dialogue, even during the most chaotic action movie sequences. Miia Karhu, a second-generation cinema owner in Finland and a leading voice in the cinema community, recently updated the sound systems in her cinemas, but now wishes that FLEXOUND Augmented Audio had come to her first. \u201cI was really surprised by the quality of the surround sound,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been told that the sound was coming only from the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 chair, I wouldn\u2019t have known \u2013 the sound seemed to come from everywhere\u201d Karhu explained after testing the concept.Riku Jaro, a sound engineer with 30 years of professional expertise in sound design, installation and optimisation, said, \u201cI'm not an outsider watching the screen anymore. I'm inside the movie because the sound is all around me\u2026 it's a full-body experience.\u201d \u201cI can see the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 being adopted across the world by audiences, because of the deep, immersive experience that it will give them,\u201d continued Jaro. \u201cFLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 makes every chair the \u2018golden chair\u2019 [in the cinema], because it delivers the ideal sound equally to every listener.\u201dDuring market research organised in May, FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 left a lasting impression on all previewers, with 91% saying that they would recommend the experience to others, 77% reporting that they had enjoyed the new sound experience a lot, and 89% saying that they want FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 in their local cinemas.\u201cI definitely want to have a FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 even in my man cave,\u201d Jaro added. \u201cNo one can disturb you and you get perfect sound in your own space, whether you are watching football or enjoying live music.\u201dThe Applications are EndlessFLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 technology has incredible potential in terms of revolutionising the cinematic, home entertainment, and wellness industries, and others:\n\u201cYou can use more than one FLEXOUND boosted device in a living room. I can be on my sofa watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy while my daughter is in the armchair listening to hip-hop, and we don\u2019t disturb one another,\u201d says Mervi Heinaro, CEO of FLEXOUND.Features of FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 concept seat:\nAvailability FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 cinema seat concept is ready for pre-orders from cinemas, and for licencing to furniture and seating manufacturers.FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 will enhance your customer experience by embedding the patented FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 technology into furniture, consumer devices, toys, car or theatre seating \u2014 or wherever personal high-quality audio and feel of sound adds value.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0news of its new outdoor lights\u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song.\u00a0Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs? Done.\nWant to take your music out of your home and on the road? TechRadar's Senior Editor of Home Entertainment, Al Griffin, has you covered. He got to experience a Mercedes-Benz S 580 tricked out with a 4D sound system furnished by German manufacturer Burmester at CES. The 31-speaker Burmester 4D configuration is an option for the latest MBUX-generation infotainment system in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and it allows for Atmos-compatible tracks to be streamed in an immersive format from\u00a0Apple\u00a0Music and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0Music.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best audio products at CES 2024\nMy pick of the top audio highlights to look out for in the year ahead\nCES 2024 may be wrapping up, but this year's event has been an amazing insight into what to expect in the world of consumer tech for the year ahead. The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding. The 64GB of onboard storage is expandable to 2TB via SD card, meaning your personal collection of audio files can be played back using the FiiO Music app. Streaming applications for all the best music streaming services (and more) can be downloaded and installed via either the Google Play Store or FiiO Store apps to deliver audio in its native quality.\nThe Full-HD 6-inch color touchscreen display on front is designed to provide easy system navigation, and the R9 comes supplied with a Bluetooth remote control too.\nThe FiiO R9 will be available from mid-January, priced at $1,499 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,239). For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

We can watch movies not only in theatres but also on devices such as TVs, laptops, cellphones and projectors. What makes the demand for watching movies in theatres so high?\nThe answer lies in the design of a movie theatre, which provides the audience with a unique cinematic experience. Everything from lighting and sound to seating arrangement is taken care of to provide maximum comfort. Still, many a time, we are unable to hear the audio due to disturbances in surroundings.\nTo tackle this problem, Finland-based startup Flexound, a member of International Cinema Technology Association (ICTA), integrated its patented technology Flexound Augmented Audio into theatre seating\u2014it is now available globally.\nThe company was founded in 2015 by acoustics specialist Jukka Linjama, along with Mervi Heinaro and Tommi Immonen. They initially worked to help autistic children by adding the sensation of touch to music, but later switched to the digital entertainment market owing to its potential. Augmented Audio module is scalable and easy to integrate. It can be embedded into cushions, car seating, furniture and many more areas, thereby providing relaxation at even low volume.\nThe major benefit of this technology is that sound quality remains the same, no matter where you are seated in the theatre, and only one module is required per seat. It also enables lower sound volume, and can be used with any pre-existing sound system without much hassle. You do not need any wearable accessories to get clarity in listening. It requires low maintenance, and has a long lifespan. Energy consumption is low, too.\nLaunched in 2017, the company\u2019s first consumer product, Humu smart cushion is a near-field listening device that contains the technology module with elastic vibrating elements to connect to the audio source of any audio-visual material. This is useful for both entertainment and health (like meditation) purposes. Sound and vibration frequency range from 20Hz to 20kHz.\nAfter initial success, Augmented Audio premiered in CineEurope, Barcelona, in June 2018, and the first-ever commercial movie theatre in Finland began using the technology in February 2019.\nAfter extensive testing at a pilot cinema, it was found that high-quality surround sound combined with physical vibrations enhanced the experience of consumers and they were ready to pay for it. The company then negotiated with exhibitors worldwide.\nFinally, Ferco Seating, a manufacturer of public seating across different venues such as cinema and auditoriums, launched two certified models\u2014Premium Verona and Premium Milano\u2014from the startup.\nVerona is a fully reclining chair that allows users to adjust the position as per need, and it is available as a single seater, twin seat or link seat with shared armrests. The optional easy-lift system and under-seat lighting enable effective cleaning. Other features include integrated tables, built-in cup holders and charging points.\nComfortable and aesthetically pleasing, Milano is available as a single or twin seat with an optional rocker-back mechanism that allows the seat to be manually reclined to any angle. Other features include footrest sensor, auto return footrest, built-in cup holders, lighting and USB charging for electric recliners. It is good for theatres where both capacity and comfort need to be kept in mind.\nPricing depends on drawing/layout, product choice, fabric and finishing, among others. Flexound also has its own Finland-produced model.\nThe company is further planning on more models and manufacturers. This gives operators an edge in their business when compared to in-home entertainment and other theatres, as more people enjoy going to cinema halls.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS & COMMENTS Cancel reply\nLog in to leave a comment\nAutomotive Window Voltage Detectors With Rapid Response\nCat Qubit Quantum Error Correction Using Low Density Parity Check\nCompact 600V Super Junction MOSFETs Catering To Modern Power Supply Needs\nWorld\u2019s First Micrometer-Accurate Distance Radar\nAutomotive Window Voltage Detectors With Rapid Response\nWorld\u2019s First Micrometer-Accurate Distance Radar\nFirst iToF Sensor With An Integrated Depth-Sensing ISP\nIndustry\u2019s Smallest Buck Regulator Module\nWhat Is A Magnetometer?\nSCADA Basics: An Overview of Automatic Control Systems\nIoT Home Automation Using ESP-32 with Videos (Hindi & English)\nLive DIY: How To Make Smoke Alarm Using UM3562\nAutomotive Window Voltage Detectors With Rapid Response\nIndustry\u2019s Smallest Buck Regulator Module\nWorld\u2019s First Parasitic Element Coupling Device For Antenna Design\nInfrared Receiver Module Upgrades\nHex To ASCII Converter\nSymmetric Stripline Impedance Calculator\nBroadside Coupled Trace Inductance Calculator\nLenz\u2019s Law And Faraday\u2019s Law Calculator\nNetwork Consists of Further Focused Websites (Channels)\nElectronics For You\nCHECKED OUT EFY EXPRESS?\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 - EFY Group\u00a9 Copyright 2022 - EFY Group"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nFlexound Pulse seat concept delivers a cinema experience without speakers\nFancy furniture immerses you in multisensory audio\nWe've had surround sound, 3D sound via Sony 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos, and now comes multisensory audio. It's a technology that adds a sense of touch to the mix, supposedly letting the viewer feel what they're hearing. It might sound crazy, but it has its roots in therapy for autistic children.\nFlexound Augmented Audio claims to create a \"unique, holistic, immersive listening experience that you can feel as well as hear\". As well as standard audio, you get \"gentle physical sound wave vibration\" to add the sensation of touch. And it works with all kinds of content, including music, games, television, streaming, movies, and VR.\nBut perhaps the most obvious application is in cinemas. The Flexound Pulse is a chair with the technology built-in \u2013 vibrations radiate through the soft foam padding, which Flexound claims make the viewing and listening experience more immersive. But Flexound believes the tech works equally well as an office chair for video calls, a gaming station, for sound massage, automotive audio, or for home viewing. It also makes content more accessible for the hearing impaired.\nIt's also less disruptive to neighbours, co-workers,\u00a0and anyone else not interested in what you're watching. Because you can feel frequencies up to 500Hz with your body and up to 1000Hz with your hands and skin, you don't have to fill the room with sound to get the full audio experience. That means far less sound leakage.\nAway from pure entertainment, it also has a therapeutic role to play. The vibro-acoustic technology was developed to provide pain relief and ease anxiety. It has been used by therapists treating children and adults with autism and development disability, people with chronic pain, rehabilitation of memory disorders, neurological and sleeping disorders, depression, and speech therapy.\nThe technology is ready to be licensed for use in cinemas and by furniture manufacturers, so look out for it at your local multiplex...\nMORE:\nThese are the best surround sound systems\nAnd here are the best AV receivers\nWant to improve your TV's audio?

        "raw_content": "Let Your Skin Do The Listening \u2013 FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 FAQs\nFLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 represents a leap forward in high-quality audio technology as well as the listening experience, so it naturally raises some good questions. Here are those we hear most often... Q: How does it feel to listen to music with FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122?A: Listening to FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 is an enriched, multi-sensory experience that uses touch to connect you to a powerful bass beat, even at low listening volumes, while the near field audio signal allows for crystal-clear clarity throughout the full audible frequency range of 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz.Q: What about the mid-range frequency response?A: Most musical instruments and vocals live in the mid-range. These frequencies can be heard but also felt with FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122, in a way that they cannot with conventional far field audio, so it becomes incredibly easy to track the detail within songs.Q: How about watching movies and streaming TV?A: When it comes to movies and streaming, soundtracks are lent a new weight that does not rely on heavy, high-powered subwoofers and our customers consistently report that the next-level clarity delivered within their personal FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 sound spheres allows dialogue to be heard distinctly, without having to crank up the volume.Q: How does the core technology in FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 work?A: The core structure is a cushion, with a patented soundboard assembly of a vibrating soundboard, an electromagnetic driver and foam layers with high quality cover material. This creates a personal sound sphere around you, using near field audio technology. Q: Is there much sound leakage from this personal sound sphereA: With the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 listening experience, there is minimal sound leakage, and the audio technology building the sound sphere does not necessarily require the same decibel levels because you have two senses compensating and contributing to the listening experience. Q: Does the technology feature noise cancellation?A: While developing the FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 technology we have noticed an interesting effect that we are calling \u2018Natural Noise Cancellation\u2019. The sound waves created by the near field audio device that is very close to you do seem to have the effect of maintaining attention to personal immersion in sound content and cancelling out external ambient noise, beyond the effects of pure decibels. Q: Which frequencies are you actually feeling through the sense of touch with FLEXOUND technology?A: Interestingly, your skin\u2019s sense of touch actually goes up to 500 Hz, and even to 1,000 Hz for your hands, so it\u2019s not just the sub-bass frequencies you are feeling, which comes as a surprise to many people. Q: What are the benefits compared to loudspeakers?A: Heavy, power-hungry loudspeakers cannot engage the sense of touch in the same way because they are transmitting the audio through air only, and they need to fill a room with sound waves, losing clarity as a result due to the reverberations that then occur.Q: What are the benefits compared to headphones?A: FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 liberates you from being attached to accessories, which deepens immersion. At the same time, you are more socially available and present. In terms of the sound characteristics, the soundscape is more ambient and does not turn with your head. FLEXOUND near field listening is something in between loudspeaker farfield and headphone \u201con-ear\u201d sound.Q: How loud does FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 sound?A: Another benefit of our technology is that by hearing through your skin as well as your ears, you don\u2019t need as many decibels to achieve clarity and immersion. This means that you can start from a lower volume but still get high-quality, full range audio. Q: Is it really a problem that cinemas have to use volume to create the far field soundscape?A: Well, 6% of the world population suffers from some kind of hearing loss and amplified audio can exacerbate this. The peak decibel requirement listed by cinema operators is 95db and extends to 105db for low frequencies. Q: How can the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 replicate cinema surround sound with just a single seat?A: FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 provides a personalised, enclosed equivalent of 5.1 surround sound by feeding the audio signal to four channels, each of which can reproduce high-quality full range audio, which is carefully mechanically tuned.Q: What if you\u2019re watching an over-the-top action movie? Would the vibration ever get too much?A: No, because we have built the system and sophisticated signal processing to take very intense low frequency sounds and intelligently manage them for a natural experience that never becomes overwhelming. FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 does not shake or move itself \u2013 what you are feeling is pure sound vibration. Q: So what would happen if I needed to hear anything above the sound of the movie? A: Because FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 creates your own personal sound sphere around your body, you can simply lean forwards in your seat to reduce the decibel level and hear ambient sounds, although this works more efficiently with our backrest seats and cushions. Q: What problems does FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 solve?A: Firstly, traditional loudspeakers neglect to use a powerful and available sense to connect and interact with audio \u2013 that of touch. Secondly, they require a lot of power because at low frequencies the efficiency of transmitting vibrations to air is poor, so traditional loudspeakers need to pump out a lot of energy to get the desired effect.Q: How do you explain the paradox of soft foam, which should insulate sound, actually conducting it in your products?A: The reason is that the soft foam is not separate but is attached to the elastic vibrating sound boards. So, dissipation or the acoustic semiconductivity of the foam combined with the soundboards is the key to this innovation that nobody else has done.Q: Could the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 single-seat technology be expanded to create an enclosed two or three-seater experience that you could share in the home?A: Yes, this is an obvious extension of the FLEXOUND Pulse\u2122 solution, which delivers the pleasant and accurate soundscape experience that is the heart and core of our offering. We are exploring those future possibilities in home and office furniture.Q: Could other applications like video conferencing become important to FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122?A: Yes, you could see a situation where an enclosure could be used as a mobile workspace to offer enhanced video conferencing with a new level of privacy, or in education, or to provide an augmented virtual reality experience. Q: How can FLEXOUND assist things like meditation and mindfulness?A: The creation of a personal sound sphere provides a distraction-free zone that really helps you escape from the information flow.Hearing through touch may boost the effectiveness of mindfulness and meditation exercises that direct your attention to your body (like having focus in sensing your breathing), in order to help activate the relaxing para-sympathetic nervous system.Q: Where does the name FLEXOUND come from?A: Firstly, FLEXOUND reflects the character of our first cushion products targeted for therapy use \u2013 they are received by children as slightly mysterious, soft, huggable and flexible embodiments of sound. Secondly, the core innovation \u2013 an elastic soundboard with porous layers \u2013 vibrates with specific characteristics in the form of flexural waves, which distribute the sound energy in a unique way, from the sound source. Finally, FLEXOUND manifests the flexibility of our Augmented Audio solutions, which shine in many industries.\nFLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u2122 adds the sensation of touch to all audio content. The versatile and patented technology was originally created to help autistic children. It can now be embedded into seats in cinemas, cars and airplanes, gaming chairs, cushions, furniture and more.Subscribe to our newsletter:\nDesigned and engineered in Finland\nThe technologySeated entertainmentFLEXOUND Pulse\u2122AutomotiveHome devicesNews & pressAbout usPrivacy policy\nTel: +358 10 5671 770info@flexound.comFinlandTiet\u00e4j\u00e4ntie 2FI-02130 EspooSwedenPumpgatan 1 (Uni3 by Geely)41755 Gothenburg\n\u201cHUMU\u201d, \u201cHUMU Augmented Audio Cushion\u201d, \u201cFLEXOUND\u201d, \u201cFLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u201d, \u201cBoosted by FLEXOUND Augmented Audio\u201d, \"FLEXOUND Pulse\" and \"Sit Inside the Sound\" are trademarks of Flexound Systems Oy.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

See our ethics statement.\nThe best audio products of CES 2024\nEvery year, we filter out the noise at CES to find the most innovative audio announcements. Across headphones, speakers, and more, we look for the products that we think will be most important to consumers in 2024 and beyond. This year, we met with dozens of audio companies and saw hundreds of new audio products. We have hand-selected the top products that caught our eye from everything announced at the show. Here are the best audio products of CES 2024!\nThe Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport brings advanced biometric tracking to wireless earbuds\nWith an integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport outputs biometric data directly to popular fitness devices and apps. This makes it easy to track your workouts in Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, Polar, Peloton, and more. Designed for runners, the earbuds have an acoustic relief channel to minimize noise from your footsteps. The MOMENTUM Sport also has a semi-open design for environmental awareness, alongside adjustable transparency mode, anti-wind mode, and adaptive noise canceling. With IP55 water and dust resistance, and a shock-proof chassis, these are the top fitness earbuds we saw at CES 2024.\nWith the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, Sennheiser brings the latest connectivity technology\nSennheiser delivered another exciting product with the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4. Built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with Snapdragon Sound, these buds from Sennheiser have the latest and greatest in connectivity technology. Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast supports future-proofs the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, while aptX lossless and low-latency provide an exceptional connection to most devices today. The earbuds also bring improved adaptive ANC, new tuning, and an upgraded battery system.\nThe JBL Extreme 4 is built to last with a replaceable battery\nThe JBL Extreme 4 has a ton of features that elevate it above your standard portable Bluetooth speaker. Using what JBL calls AI Sound Boost, the speaker analyzes incoming audio in real-time to deliver the maximum output level without distortion. The speaker now has a user-replaceable battery that works with some of JBL\u2019s other speakers, such as the new PartyBox speakers, which will extend the lifespan once the battery has worn out. Made with 70% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, this speaker is future-proof with Auracast support for multi-speaker connection.\nThe Live 3 Earbuds feature touchscreen controls and multiple fit options\nPreviously seen on the JBL Tour Pro 2, JBL has now brought touchscreen controls to the more affordable JBL Live 3 series of earbuds. The touchscreen on the charging case gives you full control over all of the functionality normally found in the JBL companion app. The Live 3 comes in three design styles: Buds, Beam, and Flex. Buds is a closed bud-style earbud without a stem, Beam is a closed stick-style earbud with a stem, and Flex is an open design for increased awareness. Later this year, JBL will be launching an at-home earbud fit test that will scan your ears using your phone camera to determine the shape and size of your ears, and then ask a series of questions about how you plan to use your earbuds. With this information, the software will suggest which of the three design options is best for you.\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra brings Ai to bone conduction\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra was a surprise to see at CES 2024. It has all the capabilities of devices like the Shokz OpenSwim Pro but adds AI-enhanced training features to bone-conduction listening. This device can talk to you with real-time workout metrics and vital signs, keeping athletes informed. It has an IP68 waterproof rating, so you can wear it underwater, pressure-sensitive haptic controls, adjustable safety lights for visibility, substantial music storage of 32GB, and a battery life of eight hours. Additionally, its companion app not only tracks athletic progress but also offers customizable exercise plans and training regimes. The HaptiFit Terra\u2019s comprehensive approach to training assistance and athlete safety is what truly caught our eye, making it a worthy recipient of our awards.\nEnjoy advanced headphone features at an affordable price with the EarFun Wave Pro\nThe EarFun Wave Pro headphones offer some pretty great features at an accessible price point. These headphones have hybrid active noise cancelation (ANC), capable of reducing up to 45dB of ambient noise, and an Anti-Wind Noise feature. Priced at just $79.99, the Wave Pro supports high-quality LDAC audio coding and Bluetooth multipoint.\nAdditionally, the EarFun Wave Pro is equipped with a low-latency game mode and voice assistant support. One of its most impressive attributes is its extraordinary battery life, offering up to 80 hours of playtime (55 hours with ANC enabled) on a mere two-hour charge, along with the capability for wired connections. These combined qualities, particularly at such an affordable price, make the EarFun Wave Pro a standout choice for consumers.\nProtect your ears while staying connected with the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP Headset\nThis product isn\u2019t the most eye-catching, but it might be the most useful piece of audio tech we saw at CES 2024. The 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP is a Bluetooth safety headset that uses light to charge its battery. On a sunny day, you can wear the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP without ever having to worry about running out of charge. With a noise canceling microphone and a Push-to-Listen (PTL) feature to help workers stay aware of their surroundings, this device may be a game changer in industries such as aviation or construction."

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: This Is the Best Audio Gear We Spotted\nAt CES 2024, we spotted plenty of audio products, from a totally wacky speaker with a built-in picture frame to practical offline translation earbuds. The concepts and products displayed at CES never cease to amaze, even if many of them ship months or years later, or not at all. This is not the conference to attend if you want to buy products today, but if you want a peak at the future of tech, there's no better place to be. Here are the best of these audio products from CES 2024.\nSamsung's musical picture frame\nRemember Samsung's popular The Frame TV? If you have one of these, or even if you don't, you should check out the Samsung Music Frame, which is a speaker with an integrated photo frame. It has a square frame (12.9 inches on each side) and it ships with an actual print, which you'll be able to customize before ordering, per Samsung. (In other words, it doesn't have a digital screen for downloading or swapping images on the fly, like a digital photo frame.) The company says this speaker provides surround sound when paired with its 2024 lineup of TVs and soundbars, but it can function as a standalone Bluetooth speaker too.\nA speaker to help with that inaudible dialogue\nOne of the biggest problems with modern movies is that the dialogue track is often too hard to hear. If you're tired of sound effects sounding too loud and not being able to understand the dialogue, the Mirai speaker might interest you. It claims to enhance dialogue audio so that you won't have to keep looking for subtitles again. Unlike a lot of the future-looking tech at CES, this one's available right now for $300.\nWaterproof earbuds that sit outside your ears\nThe popular accessories brand Anker is showing off a pair of earbuds called Soundcore Aerofit, which it calls the \"world's first open-ear earbuds with waterproofing.\" The Aerofit has an IPX7 waterproof rating, which means that you can submerge this pair of headphones in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. The open-ear design means that it sits just outside the ear canal, which may be more comfortable for some people. Anker already sells the Aerofit Pro, which has an inferior IPX5 waterproof rating. The new Aerofit offers up to 11 hours of playback on a single charge, which can be extended up to 42 hours with the charging case, according to Anker.\nA sleek soundbar for your monitor\nWhen we talk about soundbars, we mostly refer to speakers for TVs, but the Blueant Soundblade is a soundbar designed for monitors. The speaker is being showcased at CES 2024 and its sleek design immediately caught our eye. If you place it under your monitor, it'll look far more like a stand than a speaker. It supports 3.5mm aux input, USB-C, and Bluetooth 5.3. The product is available in five colors and you can pre-order it at $200. The company claims that you won't be charged until the product ships.\nEarbuds that offer offline translation\nMymanu Clik 2 is a pair of wireless earbuds that supports live translation both in-person and online. Its makers claim that the product has an eSIM and supports wifi too, and that its translation tools can be accessed offline. This product has been selected as an honoree in CES' Innovation Awards. Although pricing and availability are unclear, you can take a look at the Mymanu Clik S on the company's website to get a general idea about pricing and features.\nReducing cable clutter in home theater setups\nAn audio video receiver (AVR) is at the center of nearly every home theater setup. This creates a mass of cables behind your TV and running to each speaker in your setup. Audio Cu is a product that can replace the AVR for home theater audio and lets you reduce cable clutter by distributing sound over power. The company claims that you can connect an audio transmitter to your TV and a receiver to each speaker. The transmitter sends sound via power to each Audio Cu receiver. This means that a couple of cables will go from your TV to Audio Cu's transmitter, and each speaker will run one cable to each receiver unit. Audio Cu claims to Dolby Atmos for audio as well. The project was initially funded via Indiegogo, and it's now an honoree at CES 2024's innovation awards.\nPranay Parab is an independent tech journalist based in Mumbai, India.

If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission.\nThe Best Speakers, Headphones & Audio Gear of CES 2024 (So Far)\nIncluding Victrola's newest \"Works with Sonos\" turntable, Samsung's speaker picture thing and JBL's newest portable Bluetooth speakers.\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is in full swing and, per usual, a lot of new audio gear has been announced. From the latest flagship noise-canceling headphones to new-age wireless turntables, gorgeous active speakers to incredibly elaborate Dolby Atmos soundbars \u2014 it's all there.\nBelow, we've rounded up the coolest new audio gear that's been announced at CES 2024 so far.\nThe show runs through January 12th, and we'll continue updating this post as new gear gets revealed.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's Music Frame is part speaker and part picture frame. It's a wireless speaker that you hang on your wall and it disguises itself as artwork. The speaker has six drivers (two tweeters, two mid-range drivers and two woofers) and supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi streaming. If you have a Samsung TV or soundbar, you can configure it as a surround sound speaker, as well. Samsung will sell a variety of different prints you'll be able to display on it, too.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: this spring\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola made waves last year when it announced the Stream Carbon ($699), the company's most high-end turntable to date and, more significantly, the first turntable to work natively with Sonos. At this year's CES, Victrola has announced an even higher-end turntable, the Stream Sapphire, with more premium components and more wireless streaming capabilities. It works with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP), meaning you can connect to an AV receiver or smart TV. It's also capable of streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz).\nPrice: $1,499Availability: this spring\nSennheiser Momentum TW 4\nSennheiser Momentum TW 4\nThe Sennheiser Momentum TW 4s are the company's new flagship noise-canceling wireless earbuds. They look virtually identical to their predecessor, the 2022-released Momentum TW 3s, but the new earbuds have improved battery, more powerful noise-cancellation and improved sound (thanks to aptX lossless support).\nPrice: $300Availability: preorder on February 15; available February 20\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nThe Samsung HW-Q990D is the company's new flagship Dolby Atmos soundbar system for 2024. Like its predecessor, the much-lauded HW-Q990C, the HW-Q990D is a 11.1.4-channel system (with 22 total drivers) that connects wirelessly to a compatible Samsung TV. The difference this year is that the HW-Q990D has a built-in HDMI 2.1 port, making it much better for connecting next-gen consoles or 4K streamers. It also supports Roon for audiophiles who have other Roon-ready speakers.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: TBD\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nAudio Technica ATH-TWX7\nThe Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7s are the company's newest pair of noise-canceling wireless earbuds. They have the same 5.8mm drivers as the company's flagship ATH-TWX9s ($299), but they're considerably cheaper \u2014 just don't expect their noise-canceling to be as good. One notable upgrade is that these new earbuds support LDAC streaming (up to 24-bit/96kHz), although you'll need a compatible Android smartphone to take advantage of it.\nPrice: $199Availability: now\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro's C20 is a minimalist wireless speaker that can just about do it all. It supports Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth streaming. It has an HDMI ARC input so you can use it as a miniature soundbar for your TV, and it has a built-in MM phono stage for connecting a turntable.\nPrice: $550Availability: February 2024\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nJBL Live TWS 3\nJBL announced three pairs of noise-canceling wireless earbuds in its Live 3 series: the Live Buds 3 (earbuds), Live Beam 3 (stem, shown) and Live Flex 3 (open-ear). The three wireless earbuds share most of the same features, with the big difference being their design and fit. Maybe most significantly, all have a charging case with a built-in display (just like last year's JBL Tour Pro 2) that allows you to control playback without opening your smartphone.\nPrice: $200Availability: summer 2024\nHidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs\nHidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs\nHidizs announced the ST2 Pros, digital in-ear monitors that look to be a perfect partner to today's iPhone 15 line. They have a built-in DAC (ESS ES9281C PRO) and a USB-C connector, so you can plug them directly into your newest iPhone (or MacBook). They can play lossless audio files with support for PMC (up to 32-Bit/384kHz), DSD128 and MQA. And they have pretty stunning, mostly transparent design.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: TBD\nJBL Clip 5, Xtreme 4 and Go 4\nJBL Clip 5\nJBL announced next-gen versions of most of its ultra-portable Bluetooth speakers \u2014 there's the new Xtreme 4 ($380), Clip 5 ($80, shown) and Go 4 ($50). All have been updated to sound better (and get louder), have improved battery life and connectivity (including support for Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio), and have a more environment-friendly design.\nPrice: $50\u2013$380Availability: June 2024\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nSennhesier Momentum Sport\nThe Momentum Sports are new sport-focused wireless earbuds from Sennheiser. They're considerably different from last year's models, the Sport True Wireless, because they have more flagship-level features and, uniquely, integrated sensors for monitoring heart rate and body temperature. The neat thing is the Momentum Sports are compatible with most of today's most popular training apps \u2014 including Apple Fitness+, Garmin, Strava, Peloton and Polar \u2014 so syncing over these additional metrics is a breeze.\nPrice: $300Availability: April 2024\nSennheiser Accentum Plus\nSennheiser Accentum Plus\nThese mid-range noise-canceling wireless headphones fall between the company's Accentum ($180) and flagship Momentum 4 Wireless ($350). The \"Plus\" models look mostly the same as their budget-friendly sibling, the Accentum, but they have more features. For instance, the Plus models have swipe/touch controls (instead of buttons), wear detection sensors and a 3.5mm headphone jack for connection to more traditional analog sources. Sennheiser has also given them better ANC abilities and improved sound (thanks to support for aptX Adaptive).\nPrice: $230Availability: February 20"
