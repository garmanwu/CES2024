        "raw_content": "Newegg Announces Q3 2023 Results\nNewegg Announces Q3 2023 Results\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEGG), a leading global technology e-commerce retailer, today announced results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and revised guidance for the year ending December 31, 2023.\n\u201cWhile we continued to experience lower-than-expected results in the third quarter due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and declining consumer demand, I am excited to share the launch of several new initiatives underway, including the development of new sales channels through Walmart.com and TikTok Shop, our renewed focus on systems and finished good categories, and the expansion of our U.S. marketplace efforts,\u201d said Newegg CEO Anthony Chow. \u201cI am also proud of our continued progress in streamlining operations, an example of which includes our implementation of Geek+ autonomous robots to enhance warehouse operational efficiency. Further, we are beginning to see some positive momentum for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday shopping during the fourth quarter, which we hope to carry into the new year.\u201d\n\u201cFinally, I am pleased to have announced our inaugural $10.0 million share repurchase program last month, which we intend to use opportunistically to enhance shareholder value.\u201d\nNewegg Chief Accounting Officer Christina Ching added, \u201cWe have started to see some moderation in the rate of decline in our business in the second half as a result of momentum from our Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales period.\u201d\n\u201cOur team has moved swiftly to realize SG&A savings in response to declining demand this year, and I am pleased with our progress thus far in achieving substantial year-over-year savings. As a result of various one-time reduction expenses, we expect to see the full benefit of these initiatives in 2024. Separately, our full year projections were negatively impacted by a combination of external factors, including one-time product shortages and delayed product launch cycles, particularly in the GPU category.\u201d\n\u201cWe remain keenly focused on maintaining healthy inventory turnover and a strong cash position. Our current average inventory turnover is 40 days, and we have reduced total inventory levels from $156 million, as of December 31, 2022, to $142 million as of September 30, 2023. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2023, we had $54 million in cash on hand and no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.\u201d\n2023 Q3 Financial Highlights\n2023 Updated Full Year Guidance\nThe Company currently expects to achieve the following financial performance for the current year ending December 31, 2023:\nMr. Chow added, \u201cWe remain optimistic about the future of the business. We continue to innovate in important areas, such as social media and social sharing. As a key partner of TikTok Shop, we have substantially enhanced our social media presence and reach within the key Gen Z demographic. We also launched an innovative social sharing sales channel, Group Buy, in November. Group Buy is our daily deal offer that requires a minimum number of customers to register online each day in order to unlock an attractive deal. Group Buy is designed to encourage customers to share daily deals through social media in order to generate group excitement and attract additional traffic to our site. We believe these types of forward-looking initiatives continue to set Newegg apart in the e-commerce market.\u201d\nAbout Newegg\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEGG), founded in 2001 and based in the City of Industry, California, is a leading global online retailer for PC hardware, consumer electronics, gaming peripherals, home appliances, automotive and lifestyle technology. Newegg also serves businesses\u2019 e-commerce needs with marketing, supply chain, and technical solutions in a single platform. For more information, please visit Newegg.com.\nFollow Newegg on X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitch and Discord.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release presents certain \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d financial measures. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the schedules attached hereto.\nThe Company provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis but is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported GAAP results for the guidance period.\nGMV\nThe Company defines gross merchandise value, or GMV, as the total dollar value of products sold on its websites and third-party marketplace platforms, directly to customers and by its Marketplace sellers through Newegg Marketplace, net of returns, discounts, taxes, and cancellations. GMV also includes the services fees charged through its Newegg Partner Services (\u201cNPS\u201d) in rendering services for its third-party logistics (\u201c3PL\u201d), shipped-by-Newegg (\u201cSBN\u201d), staffing and media ad services, as well as the sales made by its Asia subsidiaries.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNewegg calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income/loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, net, income tax (benefit) provision, gain/loss from warrants liabilities, gain/loss from sales of investment, impairment of equity investment, and loss (income) from equity investment.\nNewegg believes that exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operating performance. Accordingly, Newegg believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Newegg\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Newegg; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, operating profit and Newegg\u2019s other GAAP results.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(NASDAQ: NEGG), a leading global technology e-commerce retailer, today announced results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and revised guidance for the year ending December 31, 2023.\n\"While we continued to experience lower-than-expected results in the third quarter due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and declining consumer demand, I am excited to share the launch of several new initiatives underway, including the development of new sales channels through Walmart.com and TikTok Shop, our renewed focus on systems and finished good categories, and the expansion of our U.S. marketplace efforts,\" said Newegg CEO Anthony Chow. \"I am also proud of our continued progress in streamlining operations, an example of which includes our implementation of Geek+ autonomous robots to enhance warehouse operational efficiency. Further, we are beginning to see some positive momentum for Black Friday, Cyber Monday and holiday shopping during the fourth quarter, which we hope to carry into the new year.\"\n\"Finally, I am pleased to have announced our inaugural $10.0 million share repurchase program last month, which we intend to use opportunistically to enhance shareholder value.\"\nNewegg Chief Accounting Officer Christina Ching added, \"We have started to see some moderation in the rate of decline in our business in the second half as a result of momentum from our Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales period.\"\n\"Our team has moved swiftly to realize SG&A savings in response to declining demand this year, and I am pleased with our progress thus far in achieving substantial year-over-year savings. As a result of various one-time reduction expenses, we expect to see the full benefit of these initiatives in 2024. Separately, our full year projections were negatively impacted by a combination of external factors, including one-time product shortages and delayed product launch cycles, particularly in the GPU category.\"\n\"We remain keenly focused on maintaining healthy inventory turnover and a strong cash position. Our current average inventory turnover is 40 days, and we have reduced total inventory levels from $156 million, as of December 31, 2022, to $142 million as of September 30, 2023. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2023, we had $54 million in cash on hand and no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.\"\n2023 Q3 Financial Highlights\nNet sales decreased 16.0% to $1,040.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1,239.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nGMV (defined below) decreased 20.2% to $1,265.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1,585.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nGross profit decreased 24.7% to $118.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $156.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nNet loss was $44.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA (defined below) decreased to $(17.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(4.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\n2023 Updated Full Year Guidance\nThe Company currently expects to achieve the following financial performance for the current year ending December 31, 2023:\nNet sales to be between $1.42 billion and $1.47 billion.\nGMV to be between $1.78 billion and $1.83 billion.\nGross profit to be between $160.0 million and $165.0 million.\nNet loss to be between $56.0 million and $60.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA to be between $(21.0) million and $(25.0) million.\nMr. Chow added, \"We remain optimistic about the future of the business. We continue to innovate in important areas, such as social media and social sharing. As a key partner of TikTok Shop, we have substantially enhanced our social media presence and reach within the key Gen Z demographic. We also launched an innovative social sharing sales channel, Group Buy, in November. Group Buy is our daily deal offer that requires a minimum number of customers to register online each day in order to unlock an attractive deal. Group Buy is designed to encourage customers to share daily deals through social media in order to generate group excitement and attract additional traffic to our site. We believe these types of forward-looking initiatives continue to set Newegg apart in the e-commerce market.\"\nAbout Newegg\nNewegg Commerce, Inc. (NASDAQ: NEGG), founded in 2001 and based in the City of Industry, California, is a leading global online retailer for PC hardware, consumer electronics, gaming peripherals, home appliances, automotive and lifestyle technology.

The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the schedules attached hereto.\nThe Company provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis but is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported GAAP results for the guidance period.\nGMV\nThe Company defines gross merchandise value, or GMV, as the total dollar value of products sold on its websites and third-party marketplace platforms, directly to customers and by its Marketplace sellers through Newegg Marketplace, net of returns, discounts, taxes, and cancellations. GMV also includes the services fees charged through its Newegg Partner Services (\"NPS\") in rendering services for its third-party logistics (\"3PL\"), shipped-by-Newegg (\"SBN\"), staffing and media ad services, as well as the sales made by its Asia subsidiaries.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNewegg calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net income/loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, net, income tax (benefit) provision, gain/loss from warrants liabilities, gain/loss from sales of investment, impairment of equity investment, and loss (income) from equity investment.\nNewegg believes that exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operating performance. Accordingly, Newegg believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Newegg\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Newegg; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, operating profit and Newegg\u2019s other GAAP results.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations, opinion, belief or forecasts of future events and performance.

Although Newegg believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable at the time given, these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future activities and results to be materially different from those suggested or described in this news release.
