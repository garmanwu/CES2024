The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nHere are the best new devices from CES Unveiled 2024\nCES Unveiled 2024\nOn Sunday, CES 2024 kicked off with its annual Unveiled media event that highlights various brands launching new products for the coming year. AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

        "raw_content": "Follow Us\nCES 2024: 5 top products for drone pilots (that aren\u2019t just more drones)\nJanuary 11, 2024\nSally French\n0\nNews,\nCES 2024 has been a bit of a conundrum for drone pilots.\nIt\u2019s happening right now, having kicked off on Jan. 9 and running through Jan. 12 in Las Vegas. Yet despite 4,000 exhibitors showcasing to roughly 130,000 attendees, none of the biggest names in drones exhibited this year. That\u2019s made for a bizarre narrative for the drone industry.\nAt CES 2023, I had a great time at the massive Autel booth. There, Autel used the massive tech event to launch its EVO Max 4T drone. This year, there are no booths from the biggest names. There\u2019s no Autel, and there\u2019s no Skydio, despite having both exhibited last year. There\u2019s also no booth from the biggest name in consumer drones, DJI.\nPerhaps that\u2019s unsurprising. As we\u2019ve been hammering away on this very website, the\u00a0consumer drone market is shrinking.\u00a0That\u2019s all despite the fact that the \u00a0drone market as a whole is set to grow to $54.6 billion by 2030, according to predictions from Drone Industry Insights (DII). DII has estimated a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% for the entire drone market, yet the consumer-specific arm is actually set to slightly shrink in size by an estimated CAGR of -0.3%.\nThen there\u2019s another explanation for the absence of some companies. As reported by DroneXL, DJI had been banned from last year\u2019s CES. That\u2019s because the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES, made a rule that \u201cCompanies on the Department of Commerce Entity List are not allowed to exhibit at CES.\u201d\nWith CES 2024, which is a celebration and exhibition of consumer products (CES is short for the Consumer Electronics Show), drones just weren\u2019t as big as in past years.\nThis year\u2019s CES 2024 instead has put hot tech topics like artificial intelligence at its focus. But that\u2019s not to say CES 2024 was a dud for the drone industry. In fact, it very much was not. Drones and AI go together like peanut butter and jelly. Given that, developments in other aspects of tech only mean good things for drones.\nAnd we did still see some compelling products that were actual drones. So with that, here\u2019s the ultimate guide to CES 2024 for drone pilots. Here, we\u2019re highlighting the five top product launches, news and more:\nThe 5 best CES 2024 products, news and more for drone pilots\nPABLO AIR\u2019s drone traffic management program\nDrone traffic management is shaping up to be one of the biggest drone news stories of 2024. After all, drone air traffic control is critical in enabling more drones to fly in increasingly crowded skies \u2014 and beyond the operator\u2019s sight lines.\nPABLO AIR is shaping up to be a leader in that space, if CES 2024 is any indication. The South Korean company won a 2024 CES Innovation Award in the Smart City category for its Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic management platform, \u2018UrbanLinkX\u2019.\nUrban Air Mobility is at its core. Its functions include reducing traffic management workload, improving economic viability, and mitigating operational risks. But if that sounds pretty boring, PABLO AIR\u2019s presentation at CES 2024 was hardly that. To showcase just how powerful its platform is, the company put on a drone show.\nIn fact, PABLO AIR separately is building tools designed specifically to help companies put on drone light shows.\nSheco Ark-M: an underwater cleanup drone\nWe\u2019ll start off the list with an actual drone. But, this drone, which comes from a company in Korea, doesn\u2019t fly. Sheco Ark-M calls itself a water clean-up drone, and it\u2019s really more like a water-based robot vacuum cleaner.\nPlace it on the water, and a specialized blade and filter system can collect pollutants from the water, store them, and release purified water. It is very much a drone though, in the sense that it is controlled via a touch-based screen. It can operate as far as 1 km wirelessly (or 50 meters with a wire).\nSo nifty is this product, that it even won a CES 2024 Innovation Award.\nWalmart\u2019s keynote that puts drone delivery front and center\nWalmart delivered the opening day CES 2024 keynote on Jan. 9, and its delivery drones were front and center. The keynote was about its entire system of what it calls \u201cdisruptive retail tech.\u201d Sure, that encompasses electric vehicle deliveries and AI, but drones were also at the forefront.\nAnd on Jan. 9, Walmart made some major announcements around its expansion plans.\nNow Walmart first invested in drone delivery in 2021 through DroneUp, which is a smaller drone delivery company. At the time, it was mostly operating small deliveries mostly in Arkansas. But in the past year, Walmart has really picked up investment in drones. Later that year, Walmart tapped Zipline, which is largely considered the\u00a0largest drone delivery provider\u00a0out there, to help. And last year, it tapped what\u2019s one of the biggest names in tech to take it even further. That\u2019s because, in August 2023, Walmart partnered with Wing, a drone-delivery provider powered by Google\u2019s parent.\nThings are about to get even bigger.\nWhile Walmart has already been able to reach more than 60,000 homes in the Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth area by drone delivery, it is set to expand service to millions of customers in 2024. It intends to launch more drone delivery locations in the region over the coming months using both Wing and Zipline with a goal to serve 75% of the region\u2019s population.\nWalmart\u2019s drone delivery expansion includes stores across more than 30 towns and municipalities in the DFW metroplex. That\u2019s the most number of potential customers able to be served by any U.S. retailer in a single market thus far.\n\u201cCustomers will have access to a broad assortment of items from Walmart available for delivery to their home in just minutes,\u201d said Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president, Innovation & Automation, Walmart U.S. \u201cDrone delivery is not just a concept of the future, it\u2019s happening now and will soon be a reality for millions of additional Texans.\u201d\nCanon MS-500: a tiny, nighttime camera\nIf the name Canon MS-500 sounds familiar, that\u2019s because we highlighted this unique camera in late 2023 when it earned a spot on the Time Best Inventions of 2023 list. It\u2019s back at CES with another award to its name \u2014 that\u2019s a CES 2024 Innovation Award.\nThis tiny camera should be of interest to drone pilots given its ability to capture long-range images in low lights. Notably, it\u2019s the world\u2019s first ultra-high-sensitivity camera equipped with a SPAD sensor. Also, it features the world\u2019s highest pixel count on its 1\u201d Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) sensor of 3.2 megapixels.\nThe Canon MS-500 targets applications like security and remote infrastructure monitoring, particularl in situations where identifying far-off targets accurately is critical. Mounting it on a drone could be a logical next step, considering other successful drones like the\u00a0Teal 2 have already been targeting nighttime operations. Teal relies on another similar type of sensor, the Teledyne\u00a0FLIR Hadron 640R.\nRuggON\u2019s Ground Control System (GCS)\nThe actual flying drones tend to get all the love. But, a reliable Ground Control System is just as critical to flight \u2014 even if it\u2019s not as sexy. Enter the new Ground Control System from Taiwanese tech company RuggON.\nBuilt around the RuggON LUNA 3 8-inch rugged tablet (which features a big and bright screen), this new system is compatible with most types of drones. The name signifies the standout of this product: design for rugged environments. For people flying drones in more extreme conditions, they\u2019ll take solace in knowing it is MIL-grade drop, shock, and vibration certified. It also is resistant to dust, shock and water.\nThe UAV-controlling system is certified to provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning and tracking services. And, its low-latency video software decoder allows real-time, high-resolution video viewing and data collection.\nShare this:\nRelated\nLeave a ReplyCancel reply\nSubscribe to daily updates from The Drone Girl via Email\nEnter your email to subscribe and receive email notifications of new posts.\nEmail Address\nSubscribe\nRecent Comments\nCategories\nSocial\nThe Drone Girl\u00a0\u00ae is a registered trademark of Sally French.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Sally French.

        "raw_content": "Santa Cruz Metro Purchases 57 Hydrogen Powered Electric Buses\nThe Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District (METRO) has made history by approving the purchase of 57 hydrogen-powered, fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs), marking the largest acquisition of FCEBs in United States.\nThe purchase includes forty-eight 40 ft. buses and nine 60 ft. articulated buses. Buses are scheduled for rollout starting in late 2024 with most of them being deployed in the Watsonville service area. This move will enable METRO to fully serve Watsonville and Santa Cruz County with zero-emissions vehicles.\nThese buses will be replacing the existing aging compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel buses. Currently, METRO's fleet is comprised of only 10% zero-emissions buses (ZEBs), but with this purchase, that number will be over 69%. This transition will help METRO achieve 100% zero-emission technology ahead of California's Innovative Clean Transit (ICT) Regulation deadline. This significant conversion of METRO's CNG and diesel fleet to zero-emissions FCEBs will result in a remarkable greenhouse gas emission reduction totaling 1.2 million MTCO2e.\nFor perspective, a round-trip flight from Los Angeles to New York City produces around 0.9 metric tons of CO2e per passenger. The reduction of 1.2 million MTCO2e could offset the emissions from approximately 1.33 million cross-country flights.\nSanta Cruz METRO aims to be 100% emissions-free by 2037, and acquiring these buses is a crucial step in fulfilling its climate action plan and meeting California's clean energy mandates.\nHow will these buses be fueled?\nIn conjunction with the FCEB procurement, METRO plans to construct a hydrogen fueling station to support the transition of their entire 94-bus fleet to zero-emissions vehicles. The station will also have the capacity to facilitate the fueling needs of local partner agencies and others.\nTo finance this initiative, METRO has secured $20.4 million in grant funding from the Federal Transit Administration and a $38.6 million award from the California State Transportation Agency's Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. Additionally, METRO has applied for an additional $27 million from the California Air Resources Board's Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust.\nIn June, METRO committed to purchasing the FCEBs from North American bus manufacturer New Flyer, and in August, the California Transportation Commission approved the use of 2023 TIRCP award funds for this purpose.\nThis decision to purchase FCEB\u2019s emphasizes METRO's dedication to environmental stewardship and a sustainable future. If you would like to support the Santa Cruz Metro and protect Monterey Bay\u2019s extraordinary natural resources, you can do so just by simply riding the bus via the One Ride at a Time (ORAT) program.\nAbout Santa Cruz METRO\nSanta Cruz Metropolitan Transit District (METRO) Established in 1968, METRO\u2019S mission is to provide environmentally sustainable transportation to Santa Cruz County. METRO directly operates county-wide, fixed-route and Highway 17 commuter service, with connections to Santa Clara County and Monterey Salinas Transit at our Watsonville Transit Center. The agency also operates ParaCruz paratransit service. Today METRO operates a fleet of 94 buses on 24 fixed routes and 32 paratransit vehicles.\nSubscribe to Our Weekly Newsletter!\nCONTACT\nOUR STORY\nOUR TEAM\nOUR BOARD\nINVESTING\nSTARTUP RESOURCES MANUFACTURER SUPPORT\nWEBINAR SERVICES"

Chat with our Team\nMost Powerful Scooter Yet\n84V 60Ah LG Battery + 11V 20Ah Battery = Insane Performance\nMost electric scooters come with one battery, but the X is known for taking things to the extreme. With 5040 Wh capacity in the main battery (deck) and 220 Wh in the sub-battery (stem), the Dualtron X Limited has the capability to travel insane distances and hit hyperspeeds. With separate chargers and charging ports for each battery, it takes about 15 hours to recharge the main battery and about 4 hours to recharge the sub-battery. If you get an additional charger to use both charging ports (main battery), you can cut charge time to around 8 hours.\nMinimotors EY4 LCD Dashboard: So Fresh, So Clean\nThe X Limited is the first electric scooter to come with Minimotors\u2019 new widescreen EY4 display, which is Bluetooth capable and pairs with the Minimotors app. Moving it to the center of the handlebars and more than quadrupling the size of the anti-glare display compared to the EY3 LCD, there are colorful on-screen indicators for every function. It\u2019s much easier to check multiple functions at once, like remaining mileage, cruise control, riding mode, battery voltage, battery percentage, odometer, speedometer, and temperature.\nUnlimited Lights, Unlimited Street Cred\nWith 100 watts of front-facing headlights mounted on the X Limited electric scooter, you\u2019ll illuminate the road for yourself and other riders around you. The stem has three 30W LED headlights and there are two 5W LED headlights in the deck. Another new design feature is the turn signals, including front and rear indicators integrated seamlessly with the headlights and brake lights. There\u2019s also programmable LED mood lights in the stem, deck and swingarms, and even indicators on the rear footrest. If you\u2019re riding the X with your lights on, everyone will see you coming.\nMastercrafted Minimotors Dual 2000W Machine\nUsing higher quality materials and increasing the motor magnet height in the X Limited, the dual 2000W motors are paired with dual 50A square wave motor controllers for the road-ripping acceleration Dualtron scooters are famous for. With 6000W max power, you\u2019ll get up to 70 mph top speed, and that\u2019s before you double-tap the throttle and push the output current up to 70A. The deck, which is 5 inches longer, was redesigned with heatsinks on the sides and underside to increase airflow and speed dissipation, so you can really push the X Limited to the limit.\nHydraulic Hype: Adjustable Suspension + 4-Piston Brakes\nMinimotors gave the X Limited a more robust suspension system, with thicker springs that have a higher spring rate for better damping (X2: 750 lbs/in, X Limited: 950 lbs/in), resulting in ultra stable ride quality. With adjustment knobs on the front and rear suspension, you can easily customize for softer or firmer rebound while you\u2019re riding. Now equipped with higher performance 4-piston caliper Nutt hydraulic brakes, the X Limited has more effective braking. With large ventilated 160 mm rotors and wider contact area, the reinforced 4-piston design increases stopping power significantly, and can help prevent the brake rotors from wobbling and screeching over time. Combined with the massive 13 inch ultra wide tubeless tires, it\u2019s super smooth sailing on the X Limited.\nTechnical Specifications\nCommonly Asked Questions\nWhat kind of Warranty does VoroMotors offer?\nAll new EMOVE, Kaabo, Dualtron, and Inmotion electric scooters purchased through VORO and its dealers come with a standard one (1) year limited warranty.

Still fighting with them for warranty repairs\nI would love to leave a review, but I haven't received my scooter yet, it was to be delivered to me in Friday but the driver had an emergency so we had to reschedule for Monday, once I receive my scooter I'll be happy to leave a review.\nThe X Limited is next level when it comes to range and comfort.\nIt rides smoothly and I like how the suspension can be tuned to my liking.\nThere are 2 negatives that keep me from giving it a 5-star rating: #1, it\u2019s loud. The motors are quite loud when you pull on the throttle. I am coming from the Kaabo Wolf King GT and it is whisper-quiet by comparison.\n#2, the gear shift button is located on the display in the center of the handlebars, so it\u2019s very difficult to reach it while riding.\nIt would be nice if there was a gear shift button somewhere that is reachable by thumb while riding.\nI bought this scooter to commute to work and it\u2019s a great machine, very fast and well build. I live on the first floor and it\u2019s perfect, but still a minor challenge getting up just one step, again it\u2019s a heavy boy. All in all I\u2019m very happy with my purchase and I wanna thank VoroMotors for their help, great customer service. Looking forward to there Roadrunner Pro soon.\nThis scooter is absolutley insane! The build quality is solid as a rock. It looks like a techno light show at night. I\u2019ve owned a few high performance scooters but this is the king of them all. Speed, power, stability, and one heck of a comfortable ride. I am hooked on this scooter. I love long rides but i\u2019m not so sure that i coukd outlast this battery. I emailed Voro Motors a few times with questions and i always received a reply the same day. Great scooter from a company with great customer service.

It\u2019s among the best of the best. The dual 2000W BLDC motors deliver up to 69 mph top speed (depending on the rider and conditions). With the Easywheel system, separating the hub motors, you can more easily remove the rim or the ginormous tubeless tires. With 4-piston hydraulic brakes and adjustable hydraulic suspension, you\u2019ll have excellent control and customized cushion against rough terrain. Improved technology + a legendary road warrior. This is as close to a racing-level vehicle as you can get in a production model.\nView Dualtron X Limited User Manual\u00a0and/or the EY4 LCD Display User Manual\nHave questions about buying the Dualtron X Limited?

It also may not function on very rough roads, when walls, curbs or concrete barriers are close by, or if following another car too closely. Since it \"sees\" the lane markings using a camera in the upper windshield area, it is imperative this area be clear and free of blockage such as stickers, dirt, snow, tinting material, markings and labels.
