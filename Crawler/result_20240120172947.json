        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI. Govee, a smart lighting maker from Shenzhen, is advertising the use of generative AI to help people create specific moods, like asking for a backdrop that is evocative of the Hong Kong skyline or Barbie Dreamhouse.\nXpeng is among the major electric vehicle makers at the show, where it will be demonstrating its new \u201cflying car\u201d, the AeroHT.\nTikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance have been under intense political scrutiny in Washington over data privacy and national security concerns. This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.\n\u201cWe like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don\u2019t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cInstead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.\u201d"

In addition to the demand for ever-smaller high-performance microcircuits, concerns about global climate change are fueling a movement toward green energy and high-efficiency electronic components.\nSTMicroelectronics, a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, has embraced these at times competing industry pressures by leveraging integrated approaches to microcircuit innovation. Together with its partner Shenzhen SEG Hi-Tech Industrial Co., Ltd, one of the most advanced semiconductor sealing plants in the world, joint venture STMicroelectronics Shenzhen (STS) is well positioned to meet the demands of a new consumer electronics landscape. Their success, however, has been largely enabled by the organization\u2019s strategic decision to focus talent development efforts on building analytics capability from R&D to manufacturing and beyond. Data analysis, says Deputy General Manager Wu Ling, is a strong engine for growth.\n\"Companies can make [improvement and optimization] projects more efficient when they develop data analytics talent,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the introduction of JMP\u00ae across STMicroelectronics has been a very powerful complement to our talent development.\u201d\n\"JMP is very practical. The integrated analysis it facilitates is very helpful to the way engineers think \u2013 and think critically at a high level.\"\n\u2013 Xiao Zhenglin, Training Manager, Organizational Excellence Department\nStandardizing around JMP\u00ae streamlines data workflows\nWith its user-friendly interface and code-free end-to-end analytics workflow, JMP statistical discovery software provided an easily deployed solution to STS\u2019 need for more agile statistical tools. First adopted widely with the introduction of a tiered Six Sigma program at STS in 2019, \u00a0change agents within the company began recognizing the potential of the new tool to not only make advanced industrial statistics more accessible to the plant\u2019s engineers, but also to motivate a sea change in critical thinking. With the backing of the company's executives, Six Sigma courses had by 2020 produced 41 certified Black Belts from across process engineering, R&D and quality.\nAs the helm of STS\u2019 Black Belt promotional efforts, Power System Operations Manager Li Mingjie is involved in many stages of the analytics workflow from data collection and metrology to analysis and automation. Without much previous exposure to statistical tools prior to the company\u2019s licensing of JMP, Li explains, she and others at STS\u2019 power facilities immediately recognized how the tool might enable them to take a more proactive approach to continuous improvement and statistical process control (SPC). Some engineers from the department have joined the Black Belt project team, with Li\u2019s encouragement, opening new opportunities for the group to apply the JMP workflow to SPC challenges.\nSPC applications in JMP, adds Operational Excellence Training Manager Xiao Zhenglin, are illustrative of the advantages STS has observed since it consolidated its data analysis and management tools. SPC had previously been undertaken with the aid of an SPC-specific tool and engineers had to move between platforms to convert outputs, perform other analyses and report outcomes. By dispensing of the company\u2019s disparate specialty analysis tools and standardizing around JMP, he explains, engineering workflows are now far more time and cost-efficient; JMP is equally adept at SPC, design of experiments (DOE), reliability, modeling and visualization applications, for example, and facilitates a more integrated approach to the way business value is extracted from data. \"JMP is very practical,\u201d says Xiao. \u201cThe integrated analysis it facilitates is very helpful to the way engineers think \u2013 and think critically at a high level.\"\n\"There's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to using statistical methods in our plants, so some of our engineers have joined the Six Sigma Black Belt team. This is a good trend.\u201d\n\u2013 Li Mingjie, Power System Operations Manager\nThe resolution of a quality issue marks a shift toward statistical thinking \u2013 and builds momentum for a culture transformation\nStatistical thinking has also become an important theme within STS\u2019s quality engineering group where JMP enablement and the Six Sigma ethos have introduced time and cost-saving improvements. \u201cMastering JMP has helped us to deal with our customers\u2019 problems and requirements at the Six Sigma Black Belt level,\u201d says quality engineer Sun Wentao.\nSun, who primarily works to identify and resolve quality issues that arise during the production process, is a prolific JMP user. The tool, he says, has enabled him to move from reactive quality engineering to proactive as he is now able to apply learnings from past production incidents to new product development. Though not all STS engineers were so eager to see the benefits of a companywide standard tool in JMP, Sun adds, quantifiable ROI from early proofs of concept helped to build momentum for a culture transformation.\nIn the first example, a team of engineers found that the Process Capability Index (CPK) for an aluminum wire bonding point thrust was less than 1.67 \u2013 the capability threshold \u2013 and that several machines were affected. Sun and his team had to answer a range of questions: What factors were associated with the decrease in CPK and was it related to the thrust direction or test parameters?\nPreviously, Sun explains, the team had to rely on tedious fishbone diagrams for root cause analysis wherein the probability of each cause was based on empirical inferences not backed by data. This method of theoretical and empirical argumentation may be acceptable for some qualitative root cause analysis, he says, but the data-driven approach made possible by JMP is far superior.\nUltimately, the team used a combination of hypothesis testing, single-factor variance analysis and double-sample T-tests to find significant correlation between low CPK values and artificial thrust test inconsistency. In other words, Sun says, they discovered that the setup of the thrust test tool was prone to human error \u2013 hence significant process variability. By reconfiguring the instrument, the team quickly solved the problem, returning CPK to its normal level and improving yield.\n\u201cMastering JMP has helped us to deal with our customers\u2019 problems and requirements at the Six Sigma Black Belt level.\u201d\n\u2013 Sun Wentao, Quality Engineer\nTurning to JMP, engineers improve the defect rate by 40%\nA second test case involved the resolution of a welding issue that had caused the defect rate to reach 86%. In the aluminum wire bonding industry, there are prescribed upper and lower specifications for the width of each weld; too narrow and there is insufficient bonding, too wide and the chip will fall outside of the weld parameters. Sun explains how a project team conducted defect analysis in strict accordance with DMAIC logic. First, measurement system analysis in JMP ensured that the line\u2019s equipment had the capacity to meet the weld\u2019s requirements.\nThen, a root cause analysis helped Sun and his colleagues to identify unreasonable parameter settings as the source of the high defect rate. An orthogonal test in JMP followed by an analysis of the bonding point, CPK, bond point width and other indicators helped to assess whether the model was significant. With an optimized model, the STS team derived a range of two parameters from their contour line engraver and used the parameter range defined by the simulator estimate to carry out batch trials for verification.\nUltimately, Sun explains, the team reduced their defect rate by 40% without compromising bond strength. These two case studies, he adds, marked a fundamental shift in the team\u2019s thinking and helped to bring early skeptics of statistical methods in JMP on board.\nTalent development begins with analytics\nThe momentum driving analytics transformation at STS, Wu Ling explains, is inseparable from the organization\u2019s commitment to sustainable development \u2013 a mission that not only includes social responsibility, but also the nurturing of engineering talent. From a birds-eye view, he adds, sustainable development is organizational excellence and STS has a platform for cultivating technical expertise with very mature processes and standards.\nThe company, Wu says, will refine and expand their talent pool step by step, including an extension of Six Sigma projects to energy conservation and waste reduction initiatives. Furthermore, a new project called \"Future Inside\" focuses on data analysis and optimization to increase equipment utilization and shorten production cycles.\nLooking ahead, STS aims to double its sales within three years. It\u2019s an ambitious goal, and Wu notes, will only be achieved through dual investments in technology and personnel. JMP, he adds, is the bridge between the two, and once all engineers across STS have developed the capability to really implement analytical approaches in JMP, the organization will surely feel the impact of efficiency, optimization and sustainability.\n\"Companies can make these projects more efficient when they develop data analytics talent. Therefore, the introduction of JMP across STMicroelectronics is a very powerful complement to our talent development.\u201d\n\u2013 Wu Ling, Deputy General Manager\nTry JMP free for 30 days\nThe results illustrated in this article are specific to the particular situations, business models, data input and computing environments described herein.
