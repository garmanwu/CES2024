Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus.\nShare this story\nFirst, we got AI-powered bird feeders that can tell you who is visiting your backyard, and now, a new pair of AI-supported binoculars can identify over 9,000 species of birds and other wildlife while you\u2019re hiking in the woods or roaming the halls of CES. Okay, there are no birds at CES (and not many around the Las Vegas Strip, which may not be by accident), but I did get to test out the smart binos and do some twitching (of the birding kind) on the show floor.\nThese Marc Newson-designed Swarovski Optic AX Visio binoculars look and feel like standard high-end binos, but when I trained them on a nearby avian (actually, a cardboard cutout on the top of a wood pole), they told me its species.\nHere\u2019s how: when the bird was in focus, I pressed a button, and a red circle filled in as the binoculars processed the image. Within about five seconds, the name \u2014 \u201cAmerican kestrel\u201d \u2014 popped up on the screen.\nMost birds move fast, so five seconds felt a beat too long, but the tech, powered by an \u201cintegrated operating and object-recognition system\u201d and onboard neural processing unit, is undeniably cool. The binoculars are 10 x 32 with a 1,000-yard field of view, and the image was crystal clear.\nAs an avid wildlife watcher, I would absolutely love a pair of these \u2014 especially as they also take pictures and video with a 13MP and 1080p video camera that you can transfer wirelessly to the Swarovski Optik Outdoor app on your phone. But at $4,799, this is probably not an impulse buy.\nThe binoculars also have built-in GPS to help the onboard processor know the type of species you might be looking at based on your location.\nAnother neat feature is a \u201cShare discoveries\u201d function that allows arrow markers to pop up in the viewfinder so you can pass the binoculars to a friend and they can be guided to what you saw. The AX Visio will be available to buy in February.\nGoogle CEO tells employees to expect more job cuts this year\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is smarter, pricier, and just as big as ever\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s new goal is creating artificial general intelligence\nBose\u2019s wild-looking Ultra Open Earbuds are here \u2014 kind of\nHere\u2019s our first look at Bethesda\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nLive demos are hard, y\u2019all.\nOpenAI\u2019s custom GPT Store is now open for business\nHere are all the Wi-Fi 7 routers announced at CES this year.\nIs it a bird, is it a plane, or is it a $2,500 faucet?\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The AX Visio are the world\u2019s first AI-supported binoculars and a perfect symbiosis of high-performance analog long-range optics and digital intelligence. At the touch of a button, they assist with the identification of birds and other creatures, allow discoveries to be shared, and offer a wide range of practical extra functions. The world-famous industrial designer Marc Newson is responsible for the design. With these binoculars, SWAROVSKI OPTIK is introducing the future of nature observation. The official launch of the AX Visio will take place on January 8, 2024 at the CES in Las Vegas, the world's largest event for digital technologies. From February 1, 2024, the AX Visio will be available from selected retailers and online at swarovskioptik.com.\n\u201cIn the seven decades of our existence, we have developed a deep understanding of our consumers\u2019 requirements in the hunting, birdwatching, and outdoor target groups. We leverage our know-how and cutting-edge production technologies to offer optimum technological solutions for each area of application. The integration of digital components and functions in our products brings significant added value\u201d, explained Stefan Schwarz, CEO of SWAROVSKI OPTIK, at the product presentation.\nThe AX Visio 10x32 adds new dimensions to natural experiences with numerous functions: intelligent technology combined with high-precision analog optics in SWAROVISION quality assist with real-time identification of more than 9,000 birds and other wildlife. The integrated camera captures photos and videos. These can then be immediately managed and shared with a connected smartphone using the associated SWAROVSKI OPTIK Outdoor App. The \u201cShare discoveries\u201d function is another exciting development that allows users to guide another person to the observed object using arrow markers in the display. \u201cThe AX Visio\u2019s added value for users consists of a real viewing experience that is enhanced with digital input\u201d, emphasized Andreas Gerk, Chief Technology and Operations Officer at SWAROVSKI OPTIK.\nAround five years have been invested in the development and construction of the AX Visio. The result is binoculars consisting of approximately 390 hardware parts. The intelligent core of the AX Visio is its integrated operating and object-recognition system. A Neural Processing Unit (NPU) ensures exceptionally fast processing of relevant information for object recognition. The SWAROVSKI OPTIK Outdoor App allows users to manage and share images. All device settings and future updates are also carried out in the app. The AX Visio concept ensures a product life cycle for the device over many years. \u201cThe analog components of the device, such as the optics and housing, comply with our sustainable SWAROVSKI OPTIK quality standards. The performance of the digital features is regularly updated and enhanced through regular system and function updates. An open programming interface gives creative external providers the opportunity to expand the AX Visio with new functionalities. Our aim is to promote an innovative system that continuously develops and meets users\u2019 needs for enhanced vision and more information as effectively as possible\u201d, continued Andreas Gerk.\nThe AX Visio is produced with a very high degree of vertical integration at SWAROVSKI OPTIK's main site in Absam, Austria. For CEO Stefan Schwarz, this is an important USP: \"We can draw on 75 years of experience and expertise in the development and production of high-precision sport optics. We combine this know-how and our expertise in the field of electronics with digital intelligence at our production site in the heart of Europe to create a new, pioneering product. The AX Visio is not only a flagship project with which we are demonstrating SWAROVSKI OPTIK's technological leadership in the sport optics market, but it also marks the beginning of a new technological era for us.\nThe distinctive design for the AX Visio binoculars was created by Marc Newson, a world-famous industrial designer, in collaboration with SWAROVSKI OPTIK. His key priorities included ensuring a modern appearance and intuitive handling for the smart binoculars, combined with an ergonomic design that feels comfortable to hold. Following on from the CL Curio, the AX Visio are now the second SWAROVSKI OPTIK binoculars to owe their perfect form to the Australian-born designer.\nMarc Newson has been described as one of the most influential designers of his generation. Born in Sydney, Australia, he has lived and worked in Japan, France, and the United Kingdom, where he currently resides. He has worked with brands such as Ferrari, Apple and Louis Vuitton and is responsible for some of the most iconic contemporary design pieces. Marc Newson has received numerous awards and accolades, including a CBE by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\nMore information about the AX Visio: here\nDownload article as PDF file\nHistory"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nI just saw smart binoculars at CES 2024 that can automatically identify birds\nAnd they\u2019re from Swarovski?\nWhat do you get for the bird lover who has everything? How about a pair of binoculars that can identify any bird you look at?\nAt CES 2024, Swarovski Optik \u2014 that of the crystal fame \u2014 introduced the AX Visio, a set of smart binoculars with a built-in AI that can ID more than 9,000 species of birds, mammals, butterflies, and dragonflies \u2014 and also let you record photos and videos of what you see, and share them via a smartphone app.\nWe had a chance to check them out at CES, and were impressed. But these binoculars are not ... cheep.\nAt their core, the Swarovki Optic AX Visio are a set of 10 x 32 binoculars. However, when you look through the binoculars at a bird, a red circle appears around the subject. You then press a button on the binoculars, and, provided it's recognized, the name of the bird (or mammal) will appear in red lettering. In my hands-on time, it generally took a few seconds for the binoculars to identify an image of a bird, so you better hope that whatever you're looking at doesn't quickly fly off.\nIf you're out birding with a friend, you can also \"lock\" onto a bird with the binoculars. Then, when you hand the binoculars off to your friend, they can follow directional arrows in the viewfinder to more easily locate the bird you spotted.\nA dial in the center of the binoculars lets you switch modes: Bird ID, mammal ID, compass, and camera are some of the settings.\nIn terms of technical specs, the AX Visio have a 13 MP sensor (4208 x 3120 px), and can record 1080p videos. Its 8 GB of internal memory can store around 1,700 photos or up to 1 hour of video. The binoculars' 3,000 mAh battery should last up to 15 hours on a charge.\nThe AX Visio weigh a fairly hefty 34 ounces, but they do have a tripod mount should your arms get tired. Swarovski Optik's site says the binoculars can operate in temperatures from 14 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, but makes no mention of water resistance, so you should be real careful if it's rainy outside.\nNot surprisingly, these binoculars can't be had for mere bird seed. When they become available in February, they'll cost $4,799. If you can't afford that, then there's always the Bird Buddy.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.
