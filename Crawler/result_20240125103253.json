Links in this article may result in us earning a commission. Learn More\nThe Best Solar Companies in San Antonio (2024)\nCompare quotes from the top solar installers in San Antonio, Texas using the form below.\nAniket Bhor is a solar engineer who has spent nearly a decade studying and working in the solar power sector in the European, Asian and North American markets. He is a climate enthusiast and avid cyclist, and he also loves to lose himself in books and cooking.\nTori Addison is an editor who has worked in the digital marketing industry for over five years. Her experience includes communications and marketing work in the nonprofit, governmental and academic sectors. A journalist by trade, she started her career covering politics and news in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley. Her work included coverage of local and state budgets, federal financial regulations and health care legislation.\nResearch conducted in 2022 by Environment America ranked San Antonio as sixth in the country for solar power, thanks to its 355 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity. According to our research, the best solar companies in San Antonio are Freedom Solar, ADT Solar, Elevation and Sunrun.\nWe at the MarketWatch Guides team have conducted extensive research to determine the best solar companies in the country. We then narrowed our list to the top solar installers in San Antonio based on important factors like services, cost and company reputation.\nWhat To Look for in a Solar Company\nOver 600 solar companies operate in Texas, so homeowners may find it difficult to decide which company suits their needs best. Here are a few factors to consider when exploring solar installers:\nThe price of solar technology has dropped significantly in the past decade. However, it is still a decisive factor for homeowners looking to go solar \u2014 based on our research, the average system costs $15,000 to $20,000. When deciding on installers, we recommend looking for a combination of affordable pricing, strong warranties and high-quality equipment. If needed, you can also explore companies that offer flexible payment options such as solar leases, loans and power purchase agreements (PPAs).\nLike any other technology that requires a sizable financial investment, it is important to choose a reliable provider. A trustworthy solar installer should provide a transparent consultation, high-quality installation and dependable post-installation support. To verify a solar company\u2019s reputation, you can read online reviews on platforms such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and Trustpilot.\nFor any home or business, solar power is just one way to boost energy efficiency and power bill savings. Adding services, such as HVAC or other insulation upgrades, can make your property even more efficient. Sometimes certain services, such as updating your roof or removing trees on your property, are necessary before installing solar panels. You may also want other solar services, such as a battery storage system. When shortlisting solar installers, it is worth looking at companies that offer multiple home solutions, notably those you may need.\nTop 5 Solar Companies in San Antonio of 2023\nOur picks for the best San Antonio solar panel companies are:\nFreedom Solar\nFreedom Solar is one of the biggest solar installers in Texas. It is a master dealer of SunPower solar panels and a certified Tesla Powerwall installer. Freedom Solar also specializes in off-grid solar power systems, a useful service for those looking to use solar to power a camper van or remote location.\nFreedom Solar also offers 25-year warranties on parts, performance and system workmanship. Aside from solar panel installations, Freedom provides home generators, panel dismantling and reinstallation. Based on our provider methodology, we gave Freedom Solar 4.2 out of 5 stars\nTo learn more, check out our full review of Freedom Solar.\nADT Solar\nSeveral factors make ADT Solar one of the top names in the U.S. solar sector. The company was formed in 2021 when the 148-year-old ADT group acquired Sunpro, a reputable solar installer. ADT Solar\u2019s systems use some of the best solar panels and microinverters, ensuring high performance and a long lifespan.\nADT Solar offers warranties of 25 years on products, performance and labor. It also delivers a streamlined installation process and customers benefit from 24/7 customer support. Based on our review standards, we assigned ADT Solar 4 out of 5 stars.\nTo learn more, check out our full review of ADT Solar.\nElevation\nThe most unique aspect of Powered by Elevation is its whole-home approach to energy efficiency. While many solar installers focus directly on solar panel installation, Elevation conducts a detailed audit of your property to identify areas of energy efficiency improvement. This approach can help customers save more on energy bills and potentially on solar panels.\nFounded in 2014, Elevation Solar has earned a reputation for offering high-quality solar panels and inverters and providing trustworthy customer service. It also extends 25-year warranties for products and workmanship. For these reasons, we gave Elevation 4.4 out of 5 stars.\nTo learn more, check out our full review of Powered by Elevation.\nSunrun Solar\nSunrun Solar rose to popularity by offering attractive solar lease and PPA options, which allow homeowners to go solar without a large upfront investment. Its lease models can provide customers peace of mind by including daily system monitoring and maintenance. Sunrun\u2019s systems also include a production guarantee, and the company will reimburse customers for energy lost if a system underperforms.\nSunrun\u2019s installation services include high-quality solar components and decent warranties. The company also offers EV chargers and solar batteries.

So, a 6 kW system in San Antonio would cost around $15,060 before applying solar incentives. The table below gives an overview of solar system costs for our picks for San Antonio\u2019s best installers.\n*Pricing based on responses to our March 2023 survey of 1,000 homeowners with installed solar systems. Your installation cost may vary.\n**BBB ratings are accurate as of December 2023.\nOur Recommendation\nSan Antonio residents contemplating solar have plenty of installers to choose from. Among our picks for the best options is ADT Solar, both of which have extensive industry experience. Freedom Solar may be the right pick for off-grid systems, or if upfront costs are a concern, you may find Sunrun\u2019s lease options appealing.\nUltimately, the best solar company will be different for every homeowner. We recommend you request and analyze free quotes from multiple installers before finalizing a solar energy company. You can also learn more about our picks for the best solar companies in Texas, many of which operate in San Antonio.\nBenefits of Going Solar in San Antonio\nAs with other cities, there are many advantages of installing solar power in San Antonio.\nSan Antonio Solar Incentives\nWhile San Antonio and Texas do not have as robust a solar incentive program as other areas in the country, the few available policies and incentives can make it easier to go solar. Below is an overview of the federal, state and local solar incentives and rebates available to San Antonio residents.\nFederal Incentives\nAvailable nationwide, the federal solar tax credit is an income-tax incentive that allows homeowners to save 30% on their solar system\u2019s purchase cost. If you install a home solar system, you can deduct 30% of the total value from your following year\u2019s income taxes.
