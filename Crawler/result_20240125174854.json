In the coming years, businesses will have an increasingly powerful array of technologies at their disposal that will open new pathways to unleash greater human potential, productivity, and creativity. Early adopters and leading businesses have kick-started a race toward a new era of value and capability. And their strategies are underpinned by one common thread \u2013 the technology is becoming more human.\nIt sounds counterintuitive: after all, wasn\u2019t technology built by, and for, humans? Creating tools that expand our physical and cognitive abilities is so unique to humanity that some argue it defines us as a species.\nDespite this, the tools we build are often distinctly\u00a0unhuman, filling gaps by doing and being what we couldn\u2019t, and in the process radically transforming our lives. Automobiles expanded our freedom of mobility. Cranes let us build skyscrapers and bridges. Machines helped us create, distribute, and listen to music.\nTechnology\u2019s unhuman nature can also be its drawback. Extended use of hand tools can lead to arthritis. Years of looking at screens can accelerate vision problems. We have amazing navigational tools, but they still distract us from driving.\u00a0 Granted, there have been efforts to create tools that are more ergonomic or easier to use.\u00a0 But even so, time and again we see and make decisions about our lives based on what is best for a\u00a0machine\u00a0rather than optimizing human potential.\nNow, for the first time in history, there\u2019s strong evidence to indicate that we are reversing course\u2014not by moving away from technology, but rather by embracing a generation of technology that is more human. Technology that is more intuitive, both in design and its very nature, demonstrates more human-like intelligence, and is easy to integrate across every aspect of our lives.\nGenerative AI has the potential to impact much more than just the task at hand.\nIt\u2019s also starting to profoundly reshape organizations and markets.\nConsider the impact generative AI and transformer models are having on the world around us. What began as chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard has become a driving force in making technology more intuitive, intelligent and accessible to all. Where AI once focused on automation and routine tasks, it\u2019s now shifting to augmentation, changing how people approach work, and is rapidly democratizing the technologies and specialized knowledge work that were once reserved for the highly trained or deep pocketed.\nGenerative AI has the potential to impact much more than just the task at hand. It\u2019s also starting to profoundly reshape organizations and markets.\nOf course, the advent of more human technology isn\u2019t limited to AI: It\u2019s starting to address many of the pain points that exist between us and technology, paving the way for greater human potential.\nTechnology that is human by design will reach\u00a0new\u00a0people and expand access to knowledge, which will enable ongoing innovation. Think of all the people historically alienated by technology who will be able to contribute to the digital revolution. As technology becomes more intuitive, we can tap into these people as new customers and new employees.\nMake It Human\u2014the 2024 Trends\nPeople are asking generative AI chatbots for information \u2013 transforming the business of search today, and the futures of software and data-driven enterprises tomorrow.\nAI is taking action, and soon whole ecosystems of AI agents could command major aspects of business.\u00a0Appropriate human guidance and oversight is critical.\nThe spatial computing technology landscape is rapidly growing, but to successfully capitalize on this new medium, enterprises will need to find its killer apps.\nA suite of technologies \u2013 from eye-tracking to machine learning to BCI \u2013 are starting to understand people more deeply, and in more human-centric ways.\nof executives agree that making technology more human will massively expand the opportunities of every industry.\nLeaders will face familiar questions: Which products and services are ripe for scaling? What new data is at your disposal? What transformative actions can you take? But they will also be at the center of answering questions they may have never expected: What kind of oversight does AI need? Who will be included in the digital transformation? What responsibilities do we have to the people in our ecosystem?\nHuman by design is not just a description of features, it\u2019s a mandate for what comes next. As enterprises look to reinvent their digital core, human technology will become central to the success of their efforts. Every business is beginning to see the potential emerging technologies have to reinvent the pillars of their digital efforts. Digital experiences, data and analytics, products, all stand to change as technologies like generative AI, spatial computing, and others mature and scale.\nIn this moment of reinvention, enterprises have the chance to build a strategy that maximizes human potential, and erases the friction between people and technology. The future will be powered by artificial intelligence but must be designed for human intelligence. And as a new generation of technology gives enterprises the power to do more, every choice they make matters that much more too. The world is watching. Will you be a role model or a cautionary tale?\nof executives agree that with rapid technological advancements, it is more important than ever for organizations to innovate with purpose.\nTrend 1 - A match made in AI: Reshaping our relationship with knowledge\nThe big picture\nOur relationship with data is changing\u2014and with it, how we think, work, and interact with technology.\u00a0 The entire basis of the digital enterprise is getting disrupted.\nThe search-based \u201clibrarian\u201d model of human-data interaction is giving way to a new \u201cadvisor\u201d model. Rather than running searches to curate results, people are now asking generative AI chatbots for answers. Case in point: OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, and it became the fastest-growing app of all time.\u00a0 Large language models (LLMs) had been around for years, but ChatGPT\u2019s ability to answer questions in a direct and conversational manner made a huge difference.\nData is one of the most important factors shaping today\u2019s digital businesses. And the new chatbots\u2014that can synthesize vast amounts of information to provide answers and advice, use different data modalities, remember prior conversations, and even suggest what to ask next\u2014are disrupting that undercurrent. Ultimately, these chatbots can operate as LLM-advisors, allowing companies to put one with the breadth of enterprise knowledge at every employee\u2019s fingertips. This could unlock the latent value of data and finally let enterprises tap into the promise of data-driven business.\nWith generative AI, a digital butler is finally in the cards.\nCompanies possess valuable, unique information they\u00a0want\u00a0customers, employees, partners, and investors to find and use. But whether it\u2019s because we don\u2019t recall the right search terms, we can\u2019t write the query, the data is siloed, or the documents are too dense, a lot of that information is hard to access or distill. For the data-driven business of today, that\u2019s serious untapped value that generative AI could bring in.\nHowever, the true disruption here isn\u2019t just in how we access data; it\u2019s in the potential to transform the entire software market. What if the interface to every app and digital platform became a generative AI chatbot? What if that became the way we read, write, and interact with data, as a core competency of all platforms?\nTo truly reap the benefits of generative AI and build the data-and-AI powered enterprise of the future, businesses need to radically rethink their core technology strategy. How they gather and structure data, their broader architectures, and how they deploy technology tools and the features they include need to be rethought. And new practices like training, debiasing, and AI-oversight must be built in from the start.\nof executives believe generative AI will compel their organization to modernize its technology architecture.\nThe technology: Unlocking your data-driven enterprise\nNew technologies and techniques can help enterprises shore up their data foundation and prepare for the future of data-driven business. Wherever companies start from, LLM-advisors will demand a data foundation that\u2019s more accessible and contextual than ever.\nThe knowledge graph is one of the most important technologies here. It\u2019s a graph-structured data model including entities and the relationships between them, which encodes greater context and meaning. Not only can a knowledge graph aggregate information from more sources and support better personalization, but it can also enhance data access through semantic search.\nIn addition to knowledge graphs, data mesh and data fabric are two ways to help map and organize information that businesses should consider as they update their overall architecture.\nOn their own, knowledge graphs, data mesh, and data fabric would be a huge step up for enterprise knowledge management systems. But there\u2019s much value to be gained in taking the next step and shifting from the librarian to advisor model. Imagine if instead of using a search bar, employees could ask questions in natural language and get clear answers across every website and app in the enterprise. With an accessible and contextual data foundation, enterprises can start to build this\u2014and there are a few options.\nFirst, companies can train their own LLM from scratch, though this is rare given the significant resources required. A second option is to \u201cfine-tune\u201d an existing LLM. Essentially, this means taking a more general LLM and adapting it to a domain by further training it on a set of domain-specific documents. This option is best for domain-specific cases when real-time information is not necessary, like for creative outputs in design or marketing.\nEnterprises are also beginning to fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) for specialized use cases. These SLMs are more efficient, running at lower cost with smaller carbon footprints, and can be trained more quickly and used on smaller, edge devices.\nLastly, one of the most popular approaches to building an LLM-advisor has been to \u201cground\u201d pre-trained LLMs by providing them with more relevant, use case-specific information, typically through retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\nThe field of generative AI and LLMs is moving fast, but whatever way you choose to explore, one thing will stay constant: your data foundation needs to be solid and contextual, or your LLM-advisor will never live up to its promise.\nThe implications: The future of enterprise knowledge\nFirst and most importantly, as businesses begin to explore the new possibilities LLM-advisors bring, they need to understand the associated risks.\nTake \u201challucinations,\u201d an almost intrinsic characteristic of LLMs. Because they are trained to deliver probabilistic answers with a high degree of certainty, there are times when these advisors confidently relay incorrect information. And while hallucinations are perhaps LLMs\u2019 most notorious risk, other issues must be considered. If using a public model, proprietary data must be carefully protected so that it cannot be leaked. And for private models too, data cannot be shared with employees who should not have access. The cost of computing is something that needs to be managed. And underlying everything, few people have the relevant expertise to implement these solutions well.\nAll that said, these challenges shouldn\u2019t be taken as a deterrent, but rather as a call to implement the technology with appropriate controls.\nThe data going into the LLM\u2014whether through training or the prompt\u2014should be high quality data: fresh, well-labeled, and unbiased. Training data should be zero-party and proactively shared by customers, or first-party and collected directly by the company. And security standards should be implemented to protect any personal or proprietary data. Finally, data permissions must also be in place to ensure that the user is allowed to access any data retrieved for in-context learning.\nBeyond accuracy, the outputs of the generative AI chatbot should also be explainable and align with the brand. Guardrails can be put in place so that the model does not respond with sensitive data or harmful words, and so that it declines questions outside its scope. Moreover, responses can convey uncertainty and provide sources for verification.\nFinally, generative AI chatbots should be subject to continuous testing and human oversight. Companies should invest in ethical AI and develop minimum standards to adhere to. And they should gather regular feedback and provide training for employees as well.\nSecurity implications\nAmong the many other security implications already discussed in this trend, companies should also think about how LLM-advisors may change user data dynamics.\nWe have an opportunity to reinvent the ethos of search and restore trust between businesses and their customers. Companies can now act as stewards of their own information\u2014storing, securing, analyzing, and disseminating their data and institutional knowledge directly to customers through digital advisors. This is a big responsibility: your company must ensure that your data remains secure while yielding high-confidence responses in your advisory services. It\u2019s an even bigger opportunity: without search providers mediating the exchange of information, companies can serve as a direct source of reliable insight and win back their customers\u2019 trust.\nConclusion\nGenerative AI is the ultimate game-changer for data and software. LLMs are changing our relationship with information, and everything from how enterprises reach customers to how they empower employees and partners stands to transform. Leading companies are already diving in, imagining and building the next generation of data-driven business. And before long, it won\u2019t just be leaders. It\u2019ll be the new way digital business works.\nTrend 2 - Meet my agent: Ecosystems for AI\nThe big picture\nAI is breaking out of its limited scope of assistance to engage more and more of the world through action. Over the next decade, we will see the rise of entire agent ecosystems\u2014large networks of interconnected AI that will push enterprises to think about their intelligence and automation strategy in a fundamentally different way.\nToday, most AI strategies are narrowly focused on assisting in task and function. To the extent that AI acts, it is as solitary actors, rather than an ecosystem of interdependent parts. But as AI evolves into agents, automated systems will make decisions and take actions on their own. Agents won\u2019t just advise humans, they will act on humans\u2019 behalf. AI will keep generating text, images, and insights, but agents will decide for themselves what to do with it.\nAs agents are promoted to become our colleagues and our proxies, we will need to reimagine the future of tech and talent together.\nWhile this agent evolution is just getting underway, companies already need to start thinking about what\u2019s next. Because if agents are starting to act, it won\u2019t be long until they start interacting\u00a0with each other. Tomorrow\u2019s AI strategy will require the orchestration of an entire concert of actors: narrowly-trained AI, generalized agents, agents tuned for human collaboration, and agents designed for machine optimization.\nBut there\u2019s a lot of work to do before AI agents can truly act on our behalf, or as our proxy. And still more before they can act in concert with each other. The fact is, agents are still getting stuck, misusing tools, and generating inaccurate responses\u2014and these are errors that can compound quickly.\nHumans and machines have been paired at the task-level, but leaders have never prepared for AI to operate our businesses\u2014until today. As agents are promoted to become our colleagues and our proxies, we will need to reimagine the future of tech and talent together. It\u2019s not just about new skills, it\u2019s about ensuring that agents share our values and goals. Agents will help build our future world, and it\u2019s our job to make sure it\u2019s one we want to live in.\nof executives agree leveraging AI agent ecosystems will be a significant opportunity for their organizations in the next 3 years.\nThe technology: From assistance to actions to ecosystems\nAs AI assistants mature into proxies that can act on behalf of humans, the resulting business opportunities will depend on three core capabilities: access to real time data and services; reasoning through complex chains of thought; and the creation of tools\u2014not for human use, but for the use of the agents themselves.\nStarting with access to real time data and services: When ChatGPT first launched, a common mistake people made was thinking the application was actively looking up information on the web. In reality, GPT-3.5 (the LLM upon which ChatGPT was initially launched) was trained on an extremely wide corpus of knowledge and drew on the relationships between that data to provide answers.\nBut new plugins to enable ChatGPT to access the internet were soon announced that could transform foundation models from powerful engines working in isolation to agents with the ability to navigate the current digital world. While plugins have powerful innovative potential on their own, they\u2019ll also play a critical role in the emergence of agent ecosystems.\nThe second step in the agent evolution is the ability to reason and think logically\u2014because even the simplest everyday actions for people require a series of complex instructions for machines. AI research is starting to break down barriers to machine reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting is an approach developed to help LLMs better understand steps in a complex task.\nBetween chain-of-thought reasoning and plugins, AI has the potential to take on complex tasks by using both tighter logic and the abundance of digital tools available on the web. But what happens if the required solution isn\u2019t yet available?\nWhen humans face this challenge, we acquire or build the tools we need. AI used to rely on humans exclusively to grow its capabilities. But the third dimension of agency we are seeing emerge is the ability for AI to develop tools for itself.\nThe agent ecosystem may seem overwhelming. After all, beyond the three core capabilities of autonomous agents, we\u2019re also talking about an incredibly complex orchestration challenge, and a massive reinvention of your human workforce to make it all possible. It\u2019s enough to leave leaders wondering where to start. The good news is existing digital transformation efforts will go a long way to giving enterprises a leg up.\nThe implications: Aligning tech and talent in the workforce\nWhat happens when the agent ecosystem gets to work? Whether as our assistants or as our proxies, the result will be explosive productivity, innovation and the revamping of the human workforce. As assistants or copilots, agents could dramatically multiply the output of individual employees. In other scenarios, we will increasingly trust agents to act on our behalf. As our proxies, they could tackle jobs currently performed by humans, but with a giant advantage\u2014a single agent could wield all of your company\u2019s knowledge and information.\nBusinesses will need to think about the human and technological approaches they need to support these agents. From a technology side, a major consideration will be how these entities identify themselves. And the impacts on human workers\u2014their new responsibilities, roles, and functions\u2014demand even deeper attention. To be clear, humans aren\u2019t going anywhere. Humans will make and enforce the rules for agents.\nIn the era of agent ecosystems, your most valuable employees will be those best equipped to set the guidelines for agents. A company\u2019s level of trust in their autonomous agents will determine the value those agents can create, and your human talent is responsible for building that trust.\nBut agents also need to understand their limits. When does an agent have enough information to act alone, and when should it seek support before taking action? Humans will decide how much independence to afford their autonomous systems.\nWhat can you do now to set your human and agent workforce up for success? Give agents a chance to learn about your company, and give your company a chance to learn about agents.\nCompanies can start by weaving the connective fabric between agents\u2019 predecessors, LLMs, and their support systems. By fine-tuning LLMs on your company\u2019s information, you are giving foundation models a head-start at developing expertise.\nIt's also time to introduce humans to their future digital co-workers. Companies can lay the foundation for trust with future agents by teaching their workforce to reason with existing intelligent technologies. Challenge your employees to discover and transcend the limits of existing autonomous systems.\nFinally, let there be no ambiguity about your company\u2019s North Star. Every action your agents take will need to be traced back to your core values and a mission, so it is never too early to operationalize your values from the top to the bottom of your organization.\nSecurity implications\nFrom a security standpoint, agent ecosystems will need to provide transparency into their processes and decisions.\u202fConsider the growing recognition of the need for a software bill of materials \u2013 a clear list of all the code components and dependencies that make up a software application \u2013 so as to let companies and agencies under the hood. Similarly, an agent bill of materials could help explain and track agent decision-making.\nWhat logic did the agent follow to make a decision? Which agent made the call? What code was written? What data was used and with whom was that data shared? The better we can trace and understand agent decision-making processes, the more we can trust agents to act on our behalf.\nConclusion\nAgent ecosystems have the potential to multiply enterprise productivity and innovation to a level that humans can hardly comprehend. But they will only be as valuable as the humans that guide them; human knowledge and reasoning will give one network of agents the edge over another. Today, artificial intelligence is a tool. In the future, AI agents will operate our companies. It is our job to make sure they don\u2019t run amok. Given the pace of AI evolution, the time to start onboarding your agents is now.\nTrend 3 - The space we need: Creating value in new realities\nThe big picture\nSpatial computing is about to change not just the course of technology innovation, but also the ways people work and live. Whereas desktop and mobile used screens as portals to the digital world, spatial will finally combine our disparate realities, fusing digital and physical together. Apps built for this medium will let people immerse themselves in digital worlds with a physical sense of space, or layer content on top of their physical surroundings.\nSo, why doesn\u2019t it feel like we\u2019re at the beginning of a new technology era? Why are we inundated instead with talk of a \u201cmetaverse slump\u201d? The metaverse is one of the best-known applications of spatial computing. But just look at the price of digital real estate, booming in 2021 and 2022, and down 80-90% in 2023.\nSpatial computing is about to change the course of technology innovation and the ways people work and live.\nSome enterprises are holding off, content to say metaverse hype outpaced technology maturity. But others are racing ahead, building the technology capabilities. Meta has been rapidly developing VR and AR products, and introduced Codex Avatars, which use AI and smartphone cameras to create photorealistic avatars. Epic\u2019s RealityScan App lets people scan 3D objects in the physical world with just their phone and turn them into 3D virtual assets.\nUnderlying it all, advancing technologies like generative AI continue to make it faster and cheaper to build spatial environments and experiences. And, perhaps quietly, these technologies are already being proven out in industrial applications. Digital twins for manufacturing, the growth of VR/AR in training and remote operation, and the establishment of collaborative design environments are all already having practical \u2013 and valuable \u2013 impacts on industry.\nThe truth is that new mediums don\u2019t come very often, and when they do, the uptake is slow. But the payoff for diving in early is nearly immeasurable.\nof executives agree their organization plans to create a competitive advantage leveraging spatial computing.\nThe technology: Today\u2019s spatial technology landscape\nCritically, new standards, tools and technologies are making it easier\u2014and cheaper\u2014to build spatial apps and experiences that feel familiar.\nThink about the websites you frequent or your favorite apps on your phone. Even if their purposes are different, something feels undeniably universal across even the most disparate experiences. Why? They all used the same foundation.\nFor a long time, spatial never had such a foundation. Enter Universal Scene Description (USD), or what can best be described as a file format for 3D spaces. Developed by Pixar, USD is a framework that lets creators map out aspects of a scene, including specific assets and backgrounds, lighting, characters and more. Since USD is designed around bringing these assets together in a scene, different software can be used across each one, enabling collaborative content building and non-destructive editing. USD is quickly becoming central to the most impactful spatial applications, notably within industrial digital twins.\nEnterprises need to understand they will not be operating spaces in isolation. Just as no webpage or app exists on the internet alone, the next iteration of the web promises to bring these parallel experiences even closer together.\nOne emerging capability that differentiates spatial computing from its digital counterparts is engaging our senses. New technologies are letting engineers design experiences that address all types of senses, like touch, smell and sound.\nIn past VR attempts, adding haptics, or touch, could be bulky or underwhelming. But University of Chicago researchers recently proposed using electrodes to better mimic touch.\nScents can make digital spaces lifelike, too, by evoking memories or triggering the all-important fight-or-flight response. Scentient, a company trying to bring olfactory senses to the metaverse, have been experimenting with the technology for training firefighters and emergency responders, where smells, like the presence of natural gas, can be critical for evaluating an emergency.\nOf course, sound, or spatial audio, is also critical to realistic digital scene-building. Lastly, immersive spatial apps will need to respond to how we naturally move.\nThe implications: Spatial\u2019s killer applications\nSpatial computing is not coming to replace desktop or mobile computing, but it is becoming an important piece of the computing fabric that makes up enterprise IT strategy.\nWe\u2019ve already seen the early stages. Digital twins make more sense when you walk through them. Training is more impactful when you can live the experience rather than watch a video. While these were often standalone pilots, a careful consideration of the unique advantages of spatial computing can help shape and guide enterprise strategy. The market is still maturing, but it is quickly becoming clear that spatial apps thrive when applied in three ways: conveying large volumes of complex information; giving users agency over their experience; and, perhaps counterintuitively, allowing us to augment physical spaces.\nWhen it comes to conveying complex information, the advantage of the spatial medium over the alternatives is probably clearest. Since a space can let users move and act naturally, information can be conveyed in more dynamic, immersive ways. We\u2019ve already seen it in action. Some of the earliest examples of successful spatial apps were industrial digital twins, virtual training scenarios, or real-time remote assistance.\nThe second advantage spatial has over older mediums is the ability to give users agency to shape their in-app experiences. Because spatial computing lets us build digital experiences that embody a physical sense of space, we can design experiences that give users more flexibility to move and explore.\nLastly, spatial applications bring advantages to physical spaces; they can augment, enhance, and extend physical places without materially changing them. Imagine a future office where physical monitors, projectors, and displays are replaced by spatial computers and apps. People will have the flexibility to design simpler spaces, lowering overhead costs, and to change their surroundings more easily.\nSecurity implications\nAs the working world goes spatial, businesses will also need to think about security. There will be more devices than ever \u2013 employees will use spatial devices for work, customers will use them to access experiences. And with this ever expanding device ecosystem there will be more entry points for attackers too. So how do you put borders on the borderless? Businesses\u2019 spatial strategies will need to be designed with zero trust principles.\nAdditionally, businesses should recognize that spatial is unfamiliar territory, so both vendors and users should expect to have blind spots. One line of defense won\u2019t be enough, but Defense in Depth strategies that leverage multiple layers of security (like administrative, technical, and physical) can be deployed to defend this new frontier.\nConclusion\nSpatial computing is about to hit its stride, and the race is on for leaders to get ahead. To position themselves at the top of the next era of technology innovation, enterprise leaders will need to rethink their position on spatial and recognize the effect recent technology advances are about to have. New computing mediums are few and far between, and they can have immeasurable impact on businesses and people for decades. Are you ready to immerse yourself in the moment?\nTrend 4 - Our bodies electronic: A new human interface\nThe big picture\nFailing to understand people is a limiting factor for many of technologies we use today. Just think about the robots and drones that humans can only control if we translate what we want into commands they recognize. The fact is, when tech struggles to connect with us, it\u2019s often because people\u2014what they want, expect, or intend\u2014are an enigma.\nNow, innovators are trying to change that. Across industries, they\u2019re building technologies and systems that can understand people in new and deeper ways. They\u2019re creating a \u201chuman interface,\u201d and the ripple effect will go far beyond, say, improving smart homes.\nLook at how neurotech is beginning to connect with people\u2019s minds. Recently, two separate studies from researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University demonstrated using neural prostheses\u2014like brain-computer interfaces (BCI)\u2014to decode speech from neural data. This could help patients with verbal disabilities \u201ctalk\u201d by translating attempted speech into text or generated voices.\nWhen technologies can better understand us\u2014our behavior and our intentions\u2014they will more effectively adapt to us.\nOr consider technologies that read body movement, like eye and hand tracking. In 2023, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro introduced visionOS, which lets users navigate and click with just their gaze and a simple gesture, bypassing the need for a handheld controller.\nInnovations like these are rewriting the rules and pushing the limits that have guided human-machine interaction for decades. So often today, we bend over backwards, adapting and changing what we do to make technologies work. But the \u201chuman interface\u201d will turn that on its head; when technologies can better understand us\u2014our behavior and our intentions\u2014they will more effectively adapt to us.\nTo succeed, enterprises will also need to address growing issues around trust and technology misuse. Companies and individuals alike may balk at the idea of letting technology read and understand us in these new and more intimate ways. Biometric privacy standards will need to be updated. And new neuroethics safeguards will need to be defined, including how to appropriately handle brain and other biometric data that can be used to infer people\u2019s intentions and cognitive states. Until formal regulations catch up, it\u2019s on enterprises\u2019 shoulders to earn people\u2019s trust.\nof consumers agree they are often frustrated that technology fails to understand them and their intentions accurately.\nThe technology: A more human-centric view of people\nAttempting to understand people\u2014as individuals, target groups or populations\u2014is a centuries\u2019 old business challenge. And in recent decades, using digital technology to do this has been the ultimate differentiator. Digital platforms and devices have let businesses track and quantify people\u2019s behaviors with enormously valuable impact. Now, the \u201chuman interface\u201d is changing the game again, making it possible to understand people in deeper, more human-centric ways.\nRecent technologies used to understand people have been based on tracking and observing patterns that lack specificity. People may read or watch familiar content, but they may actually want something new. We\u2019re very good at recognizing what people do, but we don\u2019t always understand why they do it.\nThe \u201chuman interface\u201d isn\u2019t any one single technology. Rather, it encompasses a suite of technologies that are deepening how innovators see and make sense of people.\nSome are using wearable devices to track biosignals that can help predict what people want or understand their cognitive state. Others are building more detailed ways to understand people\u2019s intent in relation to their environments.\nAnother approach to human intent is through AI. Consider human-robot collaborations. People\u2019s state of mind, like if they\u2019re feeling ambitious or tired, can impact how they approach a task. But while humans tend to be good at understanding these states of mind, robots haven\u2019t been. But efforts are underway to teach robots to identify these states.\nLastly, perhaps one of the most exciting \u201chuman interface\u201d technologies is neurotech: neuro-sensing and BCI. Many new neurotech companies have appeared in the last decade, and the field holds clear potential to read and identify human intent.\nMany may think neural-sensing and BCI are years away from widespread commercial use, but recent advances tell a different story.\nSkeptics tend to assert that neurotech will stay limited to the healthcare industry. But new use cases are being identified by the day. Two key advances are driving this. The first is decoding brain signals. Advances in AI pattern detection, as well as greater availability of brain data, are making a big difference.\nThe second area to watch is neuro-hardware \u2013 specifically, the quality of external devices. Historically, EEG (electroencephalogram) and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) have been two of the most widely used external brain sensing techniques. However, until recently, capturing either type of brain signal required a lab setting. But that is starting to change.\nThe implications: Getting started\u2014the right way\nAs more enterprises start to build \u201chuman interface\u201d strategies, they should begin by scoping out the different business areas and challenges that can be transformed.\nFirst, consider how \u201chuman interface\u201d technologies are raising the bar when it comes to anticipating people\u2019s actions. Some of the most promising use cases are in areas where people and machines operate in shared spaces. For instance, enterprises could create safer and more productive manufacturing systems if robots could anticipate what people were about to do.\nAnother area that can be transformed is direct human-machine collaboration: how we use and control technology. As an example, think about how neurotech is letting us tap into our minds and connect with technology in new, potentially more natural ways.\nLastly, the \u201chuman interface\u201d could drive the invention of new products and services. Brain-sensing, for instance, could help people \u201cget\u201d themselves better. L'Or\u00e9al is working with EMOTIV to help people better understand their fragrance preferences.\nStill others are thinking about the \u201chuman interface\u201d as a safety measure. Meili Technologies is a startup working to improve vehicle safety. It uses deep learning, visual inputs, and in-cabin sensors to detect if a driver has been incapacitated by a heart attack, seizure, stroke, or other emergency.\nBusiness competition is changing\u2014and trust is more important than ever\nBusinesses need to start assessing the risks posed by these technologies, and what new policies and safeguards need to be put in place. Rather than wait for regulations to ramp up, responsible enterprises need to begin now, looking to existing biometric laws and to the medical industry for guidance.\nSecurity implications\nIf tin foil hats don\u2019t prevent mind reading, what will? More than any other trend this year, security will make or break enterprise and consumer adoption of the \u201chuman interface.\"\nAcceptance of more perceptive and connected tools hinges on humans\u2019 ability to be the primary gatekeepers of what information gets shared, at a minimum. This practice needs to be integrated into the design of the next generation of human-computer interface tools, letting people either opt into sharing data or telemetry relevant to the task at hand, or opt out of sharing extraneous or sensitive information.\nConclusion\nThe human interface is a new approach to addressing one of the oldest business challenges: understanding people as humans. That\u2019s a big responsibility and an even bigger opportunity. People will have questions, and concerns about privacy will be the first and most important hurdle enterprises face. But the chance to understand people in this deeper, more human-centric way, is worth it.\nPositive engineering: Our technology crossroads\nThe world is arriving at what might be technology\u2019s biggest inflection point in history, and enterprises\u2014and the decisions their leaders make\u2014are at the heart of shaping how we move forward.\nAs we experience more growth and innovation, it won\u2019t all be for the better. There will be more (and new) opportunities for fraud, misinformation and breaches of security. If we engineer tools with human capabilities but without human intelligence\u2014or even human conscience\u2014we can create in a way that deteriorates both the bottom line and the greater good.\nIn the era of human tech, every product and every service that enterprises bring to market holds the potential to transform lives, empower communities, and ignite change, for better or for worse. And, invariably, enterprises will face the delicate balancing act of needing to act fast versus needing to act carefully, as well as the expectation that competitors or other countries may not share the same concerns or impose the same guardrails.\nAs we strive to make technology human by design, we need to think of security as an enabler, an essential way to build trust between people and technology, rather than as a limitation or requirement. And we need to build technology without overshadowing or upending what it means to be human. It\u2019s a concept we call \u201cpositive engineering.\u201d Over the last few years, ethical questions have entered the technology domain from a number of different directions. Inclusivity, accessibility, sustainability, job security, protection of creative intellectual property, and so much more. Each of them roots back to one single question: how do we balance what we can achieve with technology with what we want as people?\nThis is a transformative moment for technology and people alike, and the world is ready for you to help shape it.\nWRITTEN BY\nPaul Daugherty\nChief Technology & Innovation Officer\nAdam Burden\nGlobal Innovation Lead\nMichael Biltz\nManaging Director \u2013 Accenture Technology Vision\n\u00a9 2024\nAccenture.

        "raw_content": "Accenture\u2019s Tech Vision 2024 is driven by AI unleashing human potential\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nAccenture unveiled its 2024 Technology Vision at CES 2024 today, and it\u2019s no surprise that AI plays a big role in it.\nThe vision forecasts a transformative future where the relationship between humanity and technology is at an inflection point. Themed Human by Design: How AI Unleashes the Next Level of Human Potential, the vision presents an optimistic departure from dystopian depictions of technology\u2019s adverse effects on mankind. Accenture released the report at CES 2024, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas this week.\nHave you ever seen dystopian pictures of humans in 1,000 years? Hunched backs, sallow skin, big and sensitive eyes \u2013 the hallmarks of people who spend too much time indoors, detached from the physical world, the report said. These images reflect how the artists see our relationship with technology today. They\u2019re visceral and striking and based on true fears.\nThis vision challenges prevailing concerns surrounding technology\u2019s control over human lives and aims to redefine this relationship by making technology more inherently human.\n\u201cBut the future doesn\u2019t need to be what these artists imagine. Not if we recast the relationship between people and technology and design technology to amplify, rather than change, the things that make us human,\u201d Accenture\u2019s report declared.\nThe crux of this vision lies in the proposition that upcoming technological advancements will augment human potential, productivity, and creativity rather than supplant or control it. A suite of innovative technologies, including autonomous agents, intelligent interfaces, spatial technologies, and brain-computer interfaces, is poised to spearhead this paradigm shift.\nAccenture emphasizes that despite humanity\u2019s history of creating tools to transcend limitations, these tools have often lacked a human touch. They have functioned efficiently but failed to resonate with human characteristics. This disconnection has resulted in adverse effects, such as health issues arising from extended use of tools and technology.\nThe trade-offs with machiens have been clear.\nAutomobiles expanded our freedom of mobility. Cranes let us build skyscrapers and bridges. Machines helped us create, distribute, and listen to music. Technology\u2019s unhuman nature can also be its drawback, though. Extended use of hand tools can lead to arthritis. Years of looking at screens can accelerate vision problems. We have amazing navigational tools, but they still distract us from driving, the report said.\nThe discordance can even go beyond our physical bodies and permeate the environments we live in: homes or offices are often designed to get the best bandwidth, combustion engines may be a need for some but generate pollution for others.\nA turning point\nHowever, the turning point is upon us. Accenture\u2019s report showcases evidence of technology reversing course to become more human. The shift is manifesting in user-friendly interfaces, intuitive designs, and human-like intelligence embedded across various facets of technology.\nA cornerstone of this evolution is the rise of generative AI, which Accenture highlights as a pivotal force. The report underscores examples such as Adobe\u2019s Photoshop features, driven by AI, enabling users to manipulate images with simple text prompts. Moreover, generative AI is transcending routine tasks, augmenting human creativity, and democratizing specialized knowledge work.\nThe vision spotlights transformative applications across diverse sectors. Google Cloud\u2019s generative AI search tool revolutionizes healthcare data accessibility for professionals, while MIT\u2019s computational tool, FrameDiff, pioneers\u2019 synthetic protein structures for drug development.\nThe report also draws attention to the integration of AI into robotics, such as Boston Dynamics\u2019 Atlas robot, now equipped not only to mimic human movement but also to engage in social interactions using natural language commands.\n\u201cTechnology\u2019s fusion with human traits is imminent, enabling unparalleled productivity and value creation across industries,\u201d the report said.\nAccenture\u2019s vision underscores the ethical conundrums accompanying this transformation. As technology mirrors human capabilities, ethical dilemmas regarding AI\u2019s impact on creativity, job displacement, and societal cocooning surface. Enterprises grapple with the responsibility of positive engineering, balancing technological advancements with ethical considerations.\nThe vision challenges enterprises to leverage technology\u2019s human-centric evolution, emphasizing the critical role they play in shaping a future where technology and humanity coexist harmoniously.\nIn essence, Accenture\u2019s Technology Vision 2024 heralds an era where technology and humanity merge to unlock unprecedented potential. It urges enterprises to pioneer ethical, human-centric technological advancements that bridge the gap between innovation and social responsibility.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

Join now\nNotes from CES 2024 - Part 3\nKaren Fang Grant\nI started this series talking about the transformative role that technology plays in our day-to-day lives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and importantly, how technology can be a driving force for inclusion, self-actualization, accessibility and more. What was once impossible is now possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, done right, this is good for people and the planet. In recent years, this has been particularly powerful for individual human beings; consumers have a voice, superior understanding and reach because of technology.\nThat is not ignoring that there are equivalent risks to technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact, I could turn my sentence above around and say that technology also can foster exclusionary behavior, destroy self-esteem and promote inequity. We are hearing a lot of these concerns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and indeed, over the centuries, human beings have often reacted to new technologies with fear.\nCall me a contrarian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or maybe, an incurable optimist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I am far more likely to feel encouraged by what we have seen in the positive impact of technologies on human beings.\nEarlier this week, I attended the launch of Accenture's 2024 Tech Vision at CES. For 24 years, our team has taken a systematic look across the enterprise landscape to identify technology trends with the highest likelihood of disrupting businesses and industries.\nThis year, we highlighted how the world has reached a meaningful tipping point where AI and other disruptive technologies became \"Human by Design\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is to say much more human-like and intuitive for day-to-day consumers. And as these technologies not only become more powerful, but also far easier to interact with, they are seamlessly embedded in our day-to-day lives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ever-present and at the same time invisible.\nYou don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be a techno geek to use gen AI, and this has driven immense interest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stunningly rapid adoption. Even when looking across consumer technology applications, gen AI is getting disproportionate attention, very quickly. Check out this Google search chart comparing the trajectory for search volume between TikTok and ChatGPT.\nIt took 2.5 years for Instagram to reach 100m users. It took 9 months for TikTok to reach 100m users. ChatGPT hit this mark in less than 60 days. This is the power of technology that is human by design. Look at the chart below showing how AI is more and more quickly reaching human-like capability.\nAt this CES event, Paul Daugherty, Accenture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chief Technology & Innovation Officer, shared the central thesis of Human by Design and further described the four trends that illustrate the far-reaching and diverse power of technology that we as human beings find so endlessly accessible.\nIn short, Human by Design speaks to the fact that, as AI becomes more and more human-like, it unlocks a new era of human potential. It assists us in more human ways; it allows us to do the activities that are utterly human in nature; and it can help us to become better humans.\nA match made in AI: People are asking generative AI chatbots for information \u00e2\u20ac\u201c transforming the business of search today, and the futures of software and data-driven enterprises tomorrow.\nMeet my agent: AI is taking action, and soon whole ecosystems of AI agents could command major aspects of business. Appropriate human guidance and oversight is critical.\nThe space we need: The spatial computing technology landscape is rapidly growing, but to successfully capitalize on this new medium, enterprises will need to find its killer apps.\nOur bodies electric: A suite of technologies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from eye-tracking to machine learning to BCI \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are starting to understand people more deeply, and in more human-centric ways.\nPaul invited three great speakers to join him on stage. The first was Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the inaugural Sequoia Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and Co-Director of Stanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Human-Centered AI Institute.\nIn addition to being a truly impressive scientist and educator, I was blown away by Dr. Li's passion and perspective. (I immediately went and bought her biography, The Worlds I See.) Some key quotes from their discussion:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI belongs to all of us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just designing our work, designing our life; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really recognizing human dignity, human agency, as we bring this technology to the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Optimism doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean pure techno-utopia. I think optimism recognizes the risks and the dangers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There are potentially catastrophic risks that we need to be intentionally recognizing and trying to mitigate. The optimism I would like to underscore is the optimism in humans\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 My hope is not in AI; my hope is in people. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [with] people who come together, who have this agency to create AI for the right thing, to govern AI for the right reason, to deploy AI for the right purposes and applications that we can move society forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd in response to Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question about what people might not be anticipating, Dr. Li shared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The inflection point of 2023 is not just technological, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really public policy. [When meeting with President Biden, she shared with him that] America as a country should adopt a moon shot mentality to invest in public sector AI. [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so important that] public sector AI shoulders the responsibility of deep knowledge discovery for good, for the public, as well as technological assessment and evaluation that is independent of for-profit driven motives. And this is one area I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m excited by and I hope everyone is more aware of.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nPaul also invited Will Beery, CIO of Mars Snacking, to provide real-world stories of the application and realized potential of AI in their business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including over 100 digital twins in North America, autonomous guided vehicles and co-bots in their warehouses and factories to help mitigate labor challenges, and a manufacturing data platform to harness gen AI inside their factories. The company is also applying AI and gen AI in the consumer experience to hyperpersonalize engagement online and in the store. Finally, they are also using spatial computing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c improving productivity in the store using computer recognition to optimize merchandizing and fulfillment. His final point: CEO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly have to embrace technology in a way that, historically, they did not need to.\nFinally, Paul was joined by Mary Hamilton, Accenture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Technology Innovation Lead for North America, who shared a demonstration of the fourth technology trend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our bodies electric \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is about dissolving the barriers between humans and technologies, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153helping us to not just not struggle with technology but to use it, to help it work for us, to amplify us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nOur research labs built a Mind Gym application that combines input from Mendi headsets (which measure blood flow in your brain) and gen AI capabilities, helping users see a personalized view of their focus, and enabling them to improve their concentration and focus over time. This is just one example of the treasure troves of data around us which we can now apply in new ways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c based on a set of technologies that is meeting us on our terms.\nPaul closed by say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI is operating at a higher level than any other technology, which means as businesses we need to take a different view of how we reinvent, how we reimagine what we do. And as we do this I think it is creating a whole new world of opportunity for us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is the course that will dictate the winners and losers as we look at the next iteration of business and those next iteration of leaders that will define what it means to be human by design.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nI hope you're as inspired as I am.\nWant to hear more?

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The research further suggests that as human-centric technologies wield even greater capabilities, are easier to interact with and become even more seamlessly embedded across every aspect of our lives, we are moving toward a world where the technology around us will become more omni-present, yet also more invisible.\nAccenture\u2019s Technology Vision 2024: \"Human by Design: How AI Unleashes the Next Level of Human Potential\" explores how after years of exponential innovation, technology\u2014especially generative AI\u2014is becoming more human in its nature. And as technology evolves to be more human-centric, it drives substantially greater capabilities for people to amplify their potential and reinvent business as we know it. According to Accenture research, generative AI has the potential to impact 44% of all working hours across industries, enable productivity enhancements across 900 different types of jobs and create $6 to $8 trillion in global economic value.\n\"As AI, spatial computing and body-sensing technologies evolve to a point where tech appears to imitate human capabilities and seem invisible, what you\u2019ll see left are the people\u2014empowered with new capabilities to accomplish things they once considered impossible,\" said Paul Daugherty, chief technology and innovation officer at Accenture. \"This important seismic shift in the way people work, live and learn will accelerate a wave of unprecedented change across industries, from retail and entertainment to medicine and manufacturing. Organizations that act now to reinvent their business and ways of working using \u2018human by design\u2019 technologies will redefine what it means to be an industry leader.\"\nThe study identifies four key trends in the move to \"human by design\" technologies:\nA Match Made in AI: Reshaping our relationship with knowledge \u2013 ushering in a world where data is reorganized in ways that facilitate human-like reasoning and even mimic creativity. Instead of combing through mountains of search engine results, people will receive curated, personalized responses in the form of advice, a summation of a vast set of results, an essay, an image or even a piece of art. Searching now becomes synthesizing and business leaders who reimagine how information works in the organization and equip their people with AI-enabled enterprise knowledge tooling will realize exponential performance gains and competitive advantages.\nMeet My Agent: Ecosystems for AI \u2013 envisioning a world where AI-empowered agents work on behalf of individuals and are part of an interconnected ecosystem. These automated agents not only assist and advise us, but also take decisive actions on our behalf in both the physical and digital worlds. Working together, they multiply the collective output of workers and generate immense value for enterprises that choose to participate. 96% of executives agree that leveraging AI agent ecosystems will be a significant opportunity for their organization in the next three years.\nThe Space We Need: Creating value in new realities \u2013 creating rich, new immersive worlds of personal interaction by extending our physical, 2D worlds into new 3D environments created using spatial computing, metaverse, digital twins and AR/VR technologies.
