        "raw_content": "Solar Tents and Windows, Battery on Wheels: Energy Tech From CES 2024\nHere's the best home energy technology we saw this year, from giant batteries to stained glass solar panels to machines that harvest water from thin air.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nThe world convened at CES 2024\u00a0this past week to get its first look at the tech that could be coming to your home in the near future. Most, if not all, of the tech on display -- from the best of show to the wacky\u00a0to the cutting edge -- had one thing in common: electricity.\nWhile electricity keeps all your tech running, it's also more of a focus itself this year. There were more than enough solar-powered gadgets, portable power stations and visions for the future of energy to go around. If 2024 is the year you take control of your home's electricity, here's the tech we saw at CES that might help you do it.\nA whole home backup battery you can take with you\nEcoFlow had the Delta Pro Ultra loaded up on a cart at CES so you could wheel it around. It's surprisingly easy to move a battery that weighs nearly 200 pounds.\nThe variety of backup batteries has exploded over the last few years. Other companies have introduced their competitors to Tesla's well-known Powerwall battery, while the field of smaller, portable power stations is even more crowded. EcoFlow, a company that makes some of CNET's favorite portable power stations, introduced a new battery model that aims for the middle ground between portable and whole home backup.\nCan solar panels save you money?\nInterested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\nWhen paired with its Smart Home Panel Pro 2, EcoFlow's Delta Pro Ultra power station can provide power to your home or be unplugged and wheeled away for energy on the go. EcoFlow touts an easier setup; you only need to have the smart panel professionally installed. Unlike most home backups, which are permanent, you can take the EcoFlow with you if you move. That can save you on installation costs and keep you from having to buy a new battery at your new place. It's another step toward more reliable and flexible energy use at home.\nA solar-powered rooftop tent\nJackery's rooftop tent solar panels are a dramatic-looking way to power a camping adventure.\nJackery, a company with plenty of portable power solutions, is looking to launch its most inventive product later this year. That's when you might be able to get your hands on\u00a0a popup tent with built-in solar panels that can be mounted to the top of a vehicle. Final specs and design are being hashed out, but a company spokesperson said the solar tent is likely to cost about $6,000 when it's available for purchase.\nJackery also had a solar-powered Mars rover on display (that it has no plans of sending to Mars) and an itty-bitty power station with a capacity of just under 100 watt-hours. That means Jackery's Explorer 100 just squeezes under the battery capacity limit for items you can take on a plane, the company told CNET. As a slightly nervous flier, I expect you might draw some extra attention at security.\nControl your home's power with the push of a button\nSavant's smart energy system allows you to switch your home from on-grid to off-grid with a tap.\nSavant\u00a0is one of several companies that gives you\u00a0insight into and control over how your home uses energy. Through sensors and controllers installed in your breaker box, Savant's system lets you see where power is flowing, from your solar panels, your battery or the grid. With\u00a0newly introduced features, controlling that flow is easier than ever.\nModes and scenes are customizable configurations of what's turned on or off in your house. Modes like \"eco mode\" prioritize using power from your solar panels, while \"storm watch\" ensures your battery is topped up in case of an outage. Scenes can be set to turn off all but necessary circuits when you're away from work or to power certain circuits during one season or another. Changing all that with the push of a button makes saving energy all that much more convenient.\nA power station with swappable batteries\nThe battery packs in the Bluetti AC180T portable power station are hot-swappable, so you can just take one of these things out of the station while it's operating.\nBluetti has made some of CNET's favorite portable energy products, like power stations and solar panels, since we've been testing them over the last few years. The company is at CES this year demonstrating a few concept products it's hoping to sell in the future.\nOne is a portable power station with a twist. Rather than one battery stuck inside the walls of the power station, the AC180T has battery packs you can swap in and out, while the power station is running your devices. This could make for even more flexible charging on the go. CNET's Jon Reed said swapping the batteries was \"weirdly fun to do.\" The AC180T has an energy storage capacity of 1,433 watt-hours (or about 1.4 kilowatt-hours.) Bluetti is planning to crowdfund the device's development with an Indiegogo campaign in February.\nIndoor solar cells with a ton of applications\nThis mechanical keyboard isn't powered by batteries or with a cord but via the solar cells on the right side of it.\nSolar cells that work indoors are not new. You might have used a calculator that powered up under your middle school's fluorescent lights.\u00a0Ambient Photonics' updated version delivers about three times the energy of those older models. This means they might be able to power things with a slightly higher appetite for energy: computer mice, TV remotes or anything else that might take AA or AAA batteries.\nPortable fridges gain new features and efficiency\nGoal Zero's Alta 50 portable refrigerator can supposedly run on just 8 watts of power once it's holding at temperature. That can last a long time on even a small power station.\nBluetti's swappable battery tech will be useful in other Bluetti devices, like the MultiCooler portable fridge. The fridge can keep things cool or downright frigid, from 68 to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. What's more, it has a built-in ice maker. Whether that's strictly necessary for a portable fridge is probably up for debate, but you can imagine the device making for some truly luxurious camping.\nOther portable fridges from another portable power stalwart were debuted by Goal Zero. The Alta fridges come in 50- and 80-liter capacities. The smaller version can maintain temperature using just 8 watts of power, once it's reached the targeted temp. That means that Goal Zero's smallest power station can run the fridge for over a day. Goal Zero introduced three new portable power stations and a home battery backup, joining the trend of other energy storage companies that started small, but are now offering larger, whole-home backup solutions at a more affordable price.\nStained glass that generates electricity\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nCES is great for finding odd, but cool little gadgets and the solar sector is no exception. Japanese solar company inQs is promoting its transparent solar technology with a range of solar-powered, see-through gadgets, including a silicon quartz crystal (pictured above) that can generate photovoltaic electricity. A company representative told CNET's Jon Reed its technology could also be deployed in windows, transparent or stained.\nBecause transparent solar tech is still emerging and not yet widely deployed, the challenge of recycling them doesn't loom as large as it does from the more traditional opaque, black or blue panels you see on roofs. Still, inQs says its tech, built on silicon quartz, is easier and safer to recycle and includes no rare earth materials.\nElectronics company Panasonic was also talking up see-through solar tech this year, namely perovskites. Perovskite solar technology is still largely in research and development (and not just by Panasonic) but could open up a wide variety of solar applications, like solar on windows and the side of buildings. Or, you can stick solar on solar: In labs, perovskite solar layered on top of silicon solar panels achieves much higher efficiency ratings than either technology can separately.\nA battery that can take a beating\nXing Mobility tested its battery cooling technology by driving three needles into the side of a battery pack. You can see where those cells blew up, but the rest of the pack looks alright.\nBatteries are a key element in the electrification of everything and the transformation of the power grid. Increasing their durability and safety, especially in settings like electric vehicles, could be an important way of stretching the resources needed to make them. CNET's Jon Reed saw battery cells from Xing Mobility that, when intentionally damaged, caught fire but quickly extinguished. That's thanks to a nonconductive, petroleum-based lubricant that extinguished the fire and cooled the battery off quickly. Most of the battery actually kept its charge. Batteries with this ability could be useful in cars and tractors and trucks, where they're more likely to get a little roughed up.\nA heat pump that can keep pace in the cold\nBosch says its new IDS Ultra cold-climate heat pump can meet a home's heating needs when the outside temperature drops as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeating and cooling a home is often its biggest energy-related expense. Heat pumps are the electric heating and cooling solution of the future as they are efficient and can be powered by clean energy sources. One ding against them is their performance in cold climates, although as the technology improves, heat pumps are performing better and better below zero.\nBosch's new heat pump, the IDS Ultra, is the company's first heat pump designed for cold-weather performance. Unveiled on the CES floor this year, the IDS Ultra can keep your house warm down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) and keep working down to -13 F (-25 C). The Bosch model joins others from companies like Daikin, Midea, Johnson Controls, Lennox International, Carrier, Trane and Rheem that have passed the first stage of the Department of Energy's Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge.\nMoisture farming in the 21st century\nThe Genesis Systems WaterCube is a big steel box that pulls water from the air.\nIt sounds like tech from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but you might soon be able to pull water right from the air. The WC-100 WaterCube from Genesis Systems is an 800-pound machine that can harvest 100 gallons of water per day at 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, although the company says it can work all the way down to below 10% humidity. It should get about 200 pounds lighter before it reaches the market, the company says.\nThe WC-100 WaterCube could be useful if your water supply is disrupted or to offset your water bill. You'd have to shave a lot of that water bill to recoup the cost, which sits at a hefty $20,000.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nSolar Installer Guides\nBest Solar Products and Companies\nSolar Installers by State\nSolar Installers\nSolar Resources and Guides\nOther Energy Saving Guides\nOther Types of Energy\nLiving Off the Grid Series\nUpdated Jan. 15, 2024\n6:00 a.m. PT\nWe thoroughly evaluate each company and product we review and ensure our stories meet our high editorial standards.

        "raw_content": "Elegant Solid State EV Battery To Be Unveiled At CES 2024 By Schaeffler\u2026Who?\nThe crowded field of solid state energy storage technology is about to get a little more crowded next year, when the German automotive supplier Schaeffler will reportedly unveil its new solid state EV battery at CES 24. If the first two words that come to your mind are \u201cSchaeffler\u201d and \u201cwho,\u201d join the club. Nevertheless, the 75-year-old company known for ball bearings has gotten a firm foothold in the rarified world of solid state battery research.\nNew Solid State EV Battery To Be Unveiled At CES 2024\nThe annual Consumer Electronics Show will take place in Las Vegas on January 9-12, 2024, and AutoWeek has the scoop on the new solid state EV battery.\n\u201cAt the upcoming CES 2024, supplier Schaeffler Americas will display a \u201c\u2019next-generation\u2019 all-solid-state EV battery,\u201d noted AutoWeek reporter Todd Lassa last week.\nLassa had a chance to speak with Rashid Farahati, Schaeffler Americas director of engineering, but apparently Farahati was playing it close to the vest.\n\u201cSchaeffler\u2019s solid-state battery at CES is made with prototype parts encased in a pack built by another company that specializes in making small samples on the lab scale,\u201d Lassa reported, which doesn\u2019t exactly give away the game.\nWhat Exactly Is This New Solid State EV Battery?\nLassa also took note of a collaboration between Honda, Schaeffler, and The Ohio State University Institute for Materials and Manufacturing Research on a new battery research center, to open in 2025.\nThe new research center is not the first project linking OSU with Honda. Back in January of 2023, OSU announced that it has partnered with Honda and the US Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory on a project that earned $3.8 million in funding under the Energy Department\u2019s EVs4ALL program. The partners are tasked to develop \u201cmore affordable and efficient electric vehicle batteries.\u201d\nThe EVs4ALL award builds on previous research at OSU, which yielded a prototype EV battery that can \u201ctolerate rapid charging while exhibiting longevity far beyond the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells,\u201d as described by the school.\n\u201cThe technology can potentially double the usable battery lifetime, reduce pack size, decrease cell and battery cost, and enable rapid charging,\u201d OSU emphasized. That description fits the solid state EV battery bill, though OSU didn\u2019t use those words in its announcement.\nSeriously, What Is It?\nThe $3.8 million grant was aimed at resolving some manufacturing challenges involved in commercial production of the new solid state battery and ensuring \u201cdrop-in compatibility\u201d with other components. In addition, the partners were tasked with optimizing cold-weather performance.\nAs for what it\u2019s made out of, OSU played that close to the vest, too. \u201cThe Ohio State battery technology is based on abundant, inexpensive materials, which exhibit exceptional longevity under extreme fast-charging scenarios,\u201d is all the school had to say.\nThat leaves the solid state angle shrouded in mystery for now, though another clue surfaced in August, when Schaeffler announced that OSU is the latest institution to host its Schaeffler Hub for Advanced Research \u201ccompany on campus\u201d program.\n\u201c[T]he collaborative program will focus on all solid-state electrolyte (ASSE) battery development with future plans for fuel cell research and development,\u201d Schaeffer explained.\n\u201cThe SHARE program at The Ohio State University is the fifth worldwide and focuses on solid-state batteries and fuel cell technology. It complements our portfolio perfectly, particularly as hydrogen plays such a pivotal role for Schaeffler as energy source for a sustainable and carbon-neutral future,\u201d they add.\nAlso in August, OSU professor Anne Co \u2014 the Principle Investigator for the EVs4ALL project \u2014 was tapped as the contact for a new grant of almost $3 million from the Energy Department\u2019s ARPA-E office for high risk, high reward projects.\n\u201cThe key to EV adoption is a reliable, inexpensive battery that can charge fast and provide improved performance and range retention in cold weather compared to state-of-the-art commercial options,\u201d ARPA-E explained.\n\u201cThe Ohio State University will develop a high-power battery technology featuring a high entropy oxide (HEO) anode that can tolerate rapid charging while demonstrating longevity far beyond the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells,\u201d they added.\nHere Comes The New Solid State EV Battery From Schaeffler\nThe application of high entropy oxide materials to solid state EV battery systems is a relatively new thing, which could explain ARPA-E\u2019s interest. \u201cThe high-entropy (HE) concept is one strategy that may allow for the compositional variability needed to design new materials for next-generation batteries,\u201d a team of Canadian researchers explained in a state-of-the-science review last year.\n\u201cInspired by HE-alloys, HE-oxides are an emerging class of multicomponent ceramics with promising electrochemical properties,\u201d they elaborated. \u201cWe highlight recent results on HE-oxides for the cathode and anode. In addition, we discuss some emerging results on HE-solid electrolytes and HE-alloy anodes.\u201d\nThe use of ceramic material in a moving vehicle may sound like an accident waiting to happen, but when battery researchers talk about high tech ceramic material they are not sitting around the table at the local sip-and-clay.\nIn the meantime, something solid is afoot between Schaeffler and OSU, ceramic or not. On November 13, OSU joined with Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, US Senator Sherrod Brown, and US Representatives Joyce Beatty and Mike Carey along with Honda, Schaeffler, and representatives from the JobsOhio program to put the official seal of approval on the new battery research center, with Schaeffler taking the opportunity to underscore its commitment to solid state batteries.\n\u201cSchaeffler is developing the next generation of all solid-state battery technology to support the automotive industry\u2019s transition to electric mobility,\u201d said Schaeffler CTO Jeff Hemphill. \u201cOur strategic partnership with The Ohio State University provides a hands-on and collaborative approach with the goal of providing industry-leading and scalable solutions that will position Ohio at the center of battery technology.\u201d\nHonda won the role of lead foundational partner in the project with a commitment of $15 million.\u00a0 If all goes according to plan, the new research center will help Honda achieve its aim of pushing solid state EV batteries out of the lab and onto the assembly line.\n\u201cWe are not merely trying to establish a lab-level technology. As an automaker, we are developing all-solid-state battery technology with an eye toward mass-production,\u201d Honda explains.\nOn its part, Schaeffler is not giving anything away, but they are already making the pitch for solid state technology.\n\u201cAll solid-state batteries (ASSB) are an essential new technology because of their potential to revolutionize energy storage. These batteries offer higher energy density, granting devices and vehicles longer operational durations while providing an opportunity for fast charging,\u201d Schaeffler enthuses.\nCleanTechnica is reaching out to Schaeffler to see if they can confirm or deny the ceramics angle before CES, so stay tuned.\nImage: Solid state battery for electric vehicles courtesy of Schaeffler.\nFollow me @tinamcasey on Bluesky, Threads, Post, and LinkedIn.\nShare this story!\nTina specializes in advanced energy technology, military sustainability, emerging materials, biofuels, ESG and related policy and political matters.
