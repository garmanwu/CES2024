        "raw_content": "Chipolo announces \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d trackers at CES 2024 that are as visually unique as you are\nAutomation almost always means the death of imperfection. The reason we have robots manufacturing products is because not only is it faster, robots are much more precise than humans, resulting in the kind of consistency we\u2019ve come to expect from the Industrial Age. In a world hyper-focused on sheer perfection, Chipolo is embracing the flawed with its latest release at CES 2024, the limited edition \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo CARD Spot, exclusively compatible with the Apple Find My network.\nDesigner: Chipolo\nThe brand has launched 10,000 of these unique item trackers, each with its own minor cosmetic imperfection, a bold move that\u2019s more than just a marketing strategy \u2014 it\u2019s a statement. Chipolo is challenging the pervasive societal norms dictating that perfection is paramount, suggesting instead that these so-called \u201cdefects\u201d are often barely noticeable to others and might be unduly magnified in our own eyes.\nPrimo\u017e Zelen\u0161ek, Co-founder, and CEO of Chipolo, expressed his excitement about the launch, stating, \u201cThrough the \u2018Perfectly Imperfect\u2019 series, we aim to ease lives not just physically through functionality but also mentally, by promoting peace of mind.\u201d This initiative isn\u2019t just about producing unique trackers; it\u2019s about inspiring a change in how people view themselves and their imperfections.\nWhat sets these Chipolo CARD Spot trackers apart is not just their philosophy but also their design. Each tracker features a distinctive blemish on one side and the campaign\u2019s motto, \u201cPerfectly Imperfect,\u201d engraved on the other in a marker-like font developed in collaboration with a female-owned type design studio in Slovenia. This choice in typography reflects the brand\u2019s core values of friendliness and openness and supports the campaign\u2019s message that our imperfections contribute to our uniqueness.\nTo ensure that this \u2018imperfection\u2019 isn\u2019t just a gimmick but is more of a well-rounded message on sustainability, Chipolo has chosen to use plastic with minor imperfections that would typically be discarded, thereby reducing waste and avoiding the creation of additional pollution. This choice underlines Chipolo\u2019s commitment to the environment, ensuring that each tracker is fully functional, with only its exterior bearing the marks of its sustainable journey. It also isn\u2019t the first time Chipolo\u2019s relied on recycled plastic, as the company debuted a series of trackers made from repurposed ocean plastic back in 2020.\nKeeping in line with the campaign\u2019s overall message, the company has partnered with The Global Mental Health Peer Network, Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen \u00d6sterreichs, and VDC Zasavje, promising to donate $1 for every \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo sold. This partnership aims to support the missions of these non-profits, focusing on mental health, support for the blind and visually impaired, and social welfare, respectively.\nAs these limited edition trackers make their way into pockets and purses worldwide, they carry with them a message of acceptance, sustainability, and community support. Sometimes, it\u2019s about discovering a sense of acceptance and peace within ourselves \u2014 and that\u2019s something worth searching for.\nRelated Posts\nThinking of buying the Galaxy S24?

When developing the font, Chipolo collaborated with an independent, female-owned type design studio based in Slovenia. Chipolo wanted a lettering style that would reflect both some of the core values of the brand, such as friendliness and openness, as well as support the overarching idea of the campaign \u2014 we are not here to be perfect and, actually, our perceived imperfections are part of what make us unique.\nLaunching this line of products on the market is also a representation of Chipolo\u2019s commitment towards sustainability, as it uses plastic that, due to some imperfections it presents, would otherwise have been discarded, and only afterwards be sent to post-consumer plastic recycling. By keeping the \u201cimperfect\u201d material as it is in the manufacturing process, the team avoided the creation of additional waste, while bringing to life wallet trackers that have full functionality under the slightly imperfect exterior.\nTo amplify the impact of the campaign even further, Chipolo has partnered with The Global Mental Health Peer Network (an international organisation that builds capacity among people with lived experience of a mental health condition through empowerment, mentorship and support), Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen \u00d6sterreichs (the largest self-help and aid community for the blind and visually impaired in Austria) and VDC Zasavje (a local public social welfare institution in Slovenia). For every \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo sold, $1 will be donated to support the missions of these three non-profit organisations.\n\u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo CARD Spots will be showcased for the first time at CES 2024 at the Venetian Expo, Level 2, Halls A-D, at booth number 54243, and will be available for purchase starting January 9 on the official Chipolo website, as well as in selected independent and department retail stores.\n\u2013 Hothouse Flowers member and singer-songwriter Fiachna \u00d3 Braon\u00e1in joins BELEM to translate his body of work, while Polish indie artist Misia Furtak puts forward works to be translated \u2013 BELEM announces its second Open Call for co-production, which will see artists and labels produce translated works for cross-border promotion Paris, France and Berlin, Germany \u2014 10 January 2024 \u2014 BELEM, the Creative Europe EU-funded co-operation project focused on the monetisation, export and promotion of European lyrics and lyric translations, has announced two major European artists have won grants from the programme\u2019s first Open Call, as it also launches its...\nShaker lets you share and enjoy music with anyone on any occasion, even if you don\u2019t use the same streaming platform\u00a0 \u2013 picnics, parties, road trips and group workouts will now have the perfect soundtrack.

        "raw_content": "This AirTag competitor just did something Apple never will\nWhat happens to item trackers with cosmetic flaws? For Chipolo, the answer may surprise you. At CES 2024, the\u00a0Apple AirTag competitor is introducing a limited-edition run of its popular item trackers that just so happen to have some flaw \u2014 such as a blemish, scratch, or nick. Each accessory works as intended from a technology standpoint, with each marked \u201cperfectly imperfect.\u201d\nPer Chipolo: \u201cIn a world that frequently underscores the pursuit of perfection, Chipolo\u2019s campaign challenges those conventional societal expectations that demand flawless perfection from individuals. Each of these exclusive Chipolos, though bearing minor cosmetic flaws, functions seamlessly \u2014 highlighting the notion that what we perceive as \u2018defects\u2019 often go unnoticed by others, yet they can become pronounced in our minds as we focus on them and even magnify them.\u201d\nChipolo is releasing 10,000 of these imperfect Chipolo Card Spot trackers as part of a limited-edition run.\nChipolo is a well-known provider of Bluetooth tracking devices that help people locate their personal belongings, such as keys, bags, backpacks, wallets, and more. The company offers two primary tracking products: the Chipolo One and Chipolo Card, which are designed to cater to different customer needs.\nThe Chipolo One is a compact tracking device that resembles Apple\u2019s AirTags. It\u2019s a small circular device that can be attached to items like keys, bags, backpacks, or other frequently misplaced items. This device connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth, enabling you to track the location of your item using the Chipolo app. The Chipolo One is available in various bright colors to match your style. It was one of our favorite Bluetooth trackers of the past year.\nOn the other hand, the Chipolo Card is a slender, credit card-sized tracking device that fits easily into your pocket or wallet. It\u2019s designed to be discreet and low-profile, making it an ideal tracking device for people who want to keep their belongings safe without attracting attention. The device has a built-in battery that lasts up to a year and can be easily replaced once the battery runs out. Chipolo Cards are available in white and black.\nThe Chipolo One and Chipolo Card are user-friendly and easy to set up. You just need to download the Chipolo app on your smartphone, pair it with your device, and you\u2019re ready to go. The app allows you to ring your device when lost, view its location on a map, and even receive notifications after leaving your item behind.\nThe limited-edition \u201cperfectly imperfect\u201d Chipolo Card Spot trackers will be available starting January 9 from the Chipolo website, in addition to \u201cselect independent and department retail stores.\u201d The Chipolo Card normally retails for $30, though it\u2019s unclear if the limited edition models will cost the same.\nPerhaps Apple should consider offering slightly blemished AirTags at a lower price point, similar to what Chipolo is doing with its limited-edition trackers. This could be an opportunity for Apple to appeal to a wider market and offer more affordable options to its customers. Assuming that doesn\u2019t happen, which it likely won\u2019t, Chipolo has a nice edge over Apple here.\nApple's AirTags are in the news once more due to their misuse by perpetrators of domestic abuse. Despite, or perhaps because of, Apple's updates to iOS, there have been increasing reports of ArTags being used for stalking. A report from Motherboard this week, citing police records over a period of 8 months since the AirTag launched, found over a hundred police reports which included AirTags. A third of those, about 50, included women who suspected they were being stalked by a man in their life.\nTo recap, Apple's AirTags are small unobtrusive little discs that are meant to be attached to items allowing you to find them if misplaced. Apple has categorically ruled out tracking people without consent and retrieving stolen items as uses for AirTags, yet these are common (and obvious) use cases for AirTags.\nTile has just announced a new feature coming to its iOS and Android apps called Scan and Secure. It aims to help users keep abreast of attempts to surveil and track them using Tile's trackers. This move comes after Apple has faced criticism over its own AirTags being used in incidents of theft or stalking globally.\nTile's new Scan and Secure feature is available as part of the Tile app with a Tile account not being required. Once installed, you're able to run the tool and let it manually detect if there's a Tile-enabled device on you somewhere. The company notes that tracking people without their knowledge is against its terms of service, adding that it may also be illegal in many regions.\nApple is rolling out more antistalking tools with the next update to iOS 15, coming in the next few weeks, according to a report from MacRumors. The new update will include messaging to warn users that stalking with AirTags is a crime, as well as other features that will make it more obvious when an AirTag is traveling with you.\nThese changes are relatively small, but they are the first of a few changes Apple had promised would be coming down the line. \"Unwanted tracking has long been a societal problem, and we took this concern seriously in the design of AirTag. It\u2019s why the Find My network is built with privacy in mind, uses end-to-end encryption, and why we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted tracking. We hope this starts an industry trend for others to also provide these sorts of proactive warnings in their products,\" Apple said in a blog post.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Each of these exclusive Chipolos, though bearing minor cosmetic flaws, functions seamlessly \u2014 highlighting the notion that what we perceive as \u201cdefects\u201d often go unnoticed by others, yet they can become pronounced in our minds as we focus on them and even magnify them. Chipolo aims to redefine the narrative surrounding imperfections, highlighting the idea that what may seem imperfect on the surface can indeed be\u00a0just right.\n\u201cChipolo is excited to introduce the \u2018Perfectly Imperfect\u2019\u00a0limited series of CARD Spot trackers, as it\u2019s another testament to our dedication to create products that make our lives easier \u2014 both physically, through functionality and mentally, by helping to bring people peace of mind\u201d, said Primo\u017e Zelen\u0161ek, Co-founder and CEO at Chipolo. \u201cThrough this campaign, we want to inspire a shift in perspective, encouraging people to embrace their imperfections and recognize the real beauty in what makes each of us irreplaceable.\u201d\nEach Chipolo CARD Spot product that is part of this new series boasts its distinct blemish on one side, and the \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d engraving on the other, written in letters that resemble the type of illustration done with a marker. When developing the font, Chipolo collaborated with an independent, female-owned type design studio based in Slovenia. Chipolo wanted a lettering style that would reflect both some of the core values of the brand, such as friendliness and openness, as well as support the overarching idea of the campaign \u2014 we are not here to be perfect and, actually, our perceived imperfections are part of what make us unique.\nLaunching this line of products on the market is also a representation of Chipolo\u2019s commitment towards sustainability, as it uses plastic that, due to some imperfections it presents, would otherwise have been discarded, and only afterwards be sent to post-consumer plastic recycling. By keeping the \u201cimperfect\u201d material as it is in the manufacturing process, the team avoided the creation of additional waste, while bringing to life wallet trackers that have full functionality under the slightly imperfect exterior.\nTo amplify the impact of the campaign even further, Chipolo has partnered with\u00a0The Global Mental Health Peer Network\u00a0(an international organisation that builds capacity among people with lived experience of a mental health condition through empowerment, mentorship and support),\u00a0Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen \u00d6sterreichs\u00a0(the largest self-help and aid community for the blind and visually impaired in Austria) and\u00a0VDC Zasavje\u00a0(a local public social welfare institution in Slovenia). For every \u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo sold, $1 will be donated to support the missions of these three non-profit organisations.\n\u201cPerfectly Imperfect\u201d Chipolo CARD Spots will be showcased for the first time at\u00a0CES\u00a02024 at the Venetian Expo, Level 2, Halls A-D, at booth number 54243, and will be available for purchase starting January 9 on the official Chipolo website, as well as in selected independent and department retail stores.\nShare this:\nLike this:\nPost navigation\nCEO and expert in transport and Mobile tech.
