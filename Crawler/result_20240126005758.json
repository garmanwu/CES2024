During the showcase, Samsung will highlight 15 startups and projects \u2014 the highest number the company has ever featured \u2014 at Eureka Park at the Venetian Expo in Las Vegas, the main exhibition space for startups at the world\u2019s biggest tech show.\nThis year's CES is expected to feature more than 1,000 startups and attract more than 130,000 visitors from around the world, including business executives, investors and media. At the event, Samsung expects startups from C-Lab to assess global market responses, strengthen their business feasibility and meet with investors.\n\u201cThe goal of the C-Lab program is to elevate a platform for startups to grow and flourish,\u201d said Pilgyu Jeon, Executive Vice President and Head of the Creativity & Innovation Center at Samsung Electronics. \u201cCES is the perfect venue for these exciting companies and projects to show major tech players that they belong on the global stage.\u201d\nThe C-Lab program was created in 2012 and since it was established, Samsung has nurtured a total of 872 startups and projects. This includes 475 through C-Lab Outside and 397 through C-Lab Inside. In particular, the 537 C-Lab startups (62 from C-Lab Spin-off and 475 from C-Lab Outside) have raised a cumulative total of $1 billion in investment.\nC-Lab Outside: Ten Startups That Include AI, Energy and Healthcare Products\nC-Lab Outside was created in October 2018, and startups selected for the program receive full support \u2014 including office workspaces, customized development programs and investment \u2014 along with business cooperation from Samsung Electronics. Dr.Tail, an online veterinary consultation service, has collaborated with Samsung Electronics to bring its services to Samsung Smart TVs[1] and will be exhibited at the C-Lab booths at CES.\nIn addition to Dr.Tail, Samsung Electronics will exhibit nine other startups selected and supported by the C-Lab Outside program:\nRebuilderAI: AI solutions for fast and easy 3D content creation on smartphonesGhost Pass: decentralized remote biometric authentication solutionsDEEPX: an NPU-based[2] AI semiconductorStyle Bot: a fashion recommendation service based on user-owned clothing dataVsion: a smart window with adjustable transparencyDolbomDream: a smart, inflatable jacket designed to monitor the health of senior citizens60Hertz: an AI-powered virtual power plant (VPP) solutionWrtn Technologies: a generative AI portal serviceNdotLight: a web-based collaborative 3D design platform\"We are excited to be part of C-Lab\u2019s high-profile startup booth at Eureka Park,\" said Sunkwan Lee, CEO of Ghost Pass. \u201cThanks to the support of Samsung C-Lab, we won the CES Innovation Award this year, which I think makes this year\u2019s CES a good opportunity for us to take a step toward going global.\"\nTwo C-Lab Inside Projects From Samsung Employees and Three C-Lab Spin-off Startups That Started at Samsung\nSamsung has been exhibiting its C-Lab Inside projects at CES since 2016, and this year\u2019s CES exhibit will feature two projects that are currently being fostered in-house.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

The company will be participating in the event held in Las Vegas, USA from January 9\u201312, with an exhibition revolving around the theme \u2018All-in Innovative Tech: Paving the New Journey\u2019.\nThe company will\u00a0unveil a new generation of products that can be folded inwards and outwards. Additionally, new monitor-sized OLEDs with both foldable and slidable technologies will be unveiled. It will also showcase a microdisplay with ultra-high resolution for immersive extended reality (XR) experiences that will enhance the way users interact with their devices.\nSamsung Display will showcase its OLED technology across various sizes and form factors. This includes QD-OLEDs designed for monitors with the highest level of pixel density and refresh rates for self-illuminating technology. The company will also present QD-OLEDs specifically developed for televisions, boasting the highest brightness available in the market.\nFlex In&Out\u2122 Flip folds in and out 360 degrees and Rollable Flex\u2122 offers 5x the screen size\nOne of the most eye-catching products at CES 2024 is the Flex In&Out\u2122 Flip, a foldable device with a flip-phone design. Its unique in-and-out foldable technology allows it to fold 360 degrees. Unlike traditional in-folding devices that require an additional panel on the outside for displaying information when folded, Flex In&Out\u2122 Flip achieves a sleeker and thinner design with a single display that can be folded outwards to allow use of the display even when folded.\n\u201cFlex In&Out\u2122 Flip is a technology that can provide a new alternative for consumers who prefer bar-shaped smartphones due to the thickness of foldable products,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cWhen folded outwards, both the front and back of the product can be used as a screen, creating a new user experience.\u201d\nSamsung Display\u2019s durability tests showcase its expertise in foldable technology. The panels underwent folding in extreme temperatures ranging from -20 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, basketballs are bounced on the foldable panels, and the smartphones are subjected to rubbing with sand and immersion in water. These rigorous tests should provide customers with a clear understanding of the durability of Samsung\u2019s foldable products, even in challenging environments.\nSamsung Display will not only be presenting its foldable products at the event but also a range of other innovative offerings. One of these is the Rollable Flex\u2122, a unique device that allows the screen to expand up to five times its original size when unrolled, resembling the action of unrolling a scroll. Another exciting product is the Flex Hybrid, which combines the functionalities of both foldable and slidable technologies. Lastly, Samsung Display will also showcase a wireless earphone case that features a built-in display. These products demonstrate Samsung\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of display technology and delivering innovative solutions to consumers.\nFind the hidden display in the vehicle\nSamsung Display will be showcasing its revolutionary OLED products for vehicle interiors, including the Flex Note Extendable\u2122. This innovative product features a foldable panel that can be unfolded and extended to provide a larger screen size. The Flex Note Extendable\u2122 measures 11 inches when fully folded but can be extended to 13.8 inches with a 10:9 aspect ratio by unfolding one side. By sliding out the other section, the size can be further extended to 17.3 inches with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This flexible design allows for an optimized user experience based on the content being displayed.\nThe screen can serve as a laptop for working in the car or as an extended display for watching movies. When not in use, it can be minimized to save space in the car.\n\u201cCars are now evolving into a mobile space beyond just a means of transportation,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cOLED products combined with foldable and slidable technologies will accelerate this transformation.\u201d\nDisplays can be concealed in various areas of the car and easily accessed when needed. An instance of this is a roll-up display, similar in size to a tablet (12.4 inches), discreetly stored within the front passenger headrest. This display can be extended vertically to accommodate different needs, ensuring flexibility and convenience.\nWorld\u2019s first 8.6-generation glass for OLEDs for IT and ultra-thin panels\nHighlighting the shift from LCD to OLED technology in the IT industry, Samsung Display will demonstrate its strength at CES 2024.\nAt CES, Samsung Display will showcase its investment in the 8.6-generation OLED for IT by displaying a nearly 3-meter-high mother glass. This glass, measuring 2290x2620mm, is the largest in the industry and aims to attract visitors\u2019 attention. The 8.6-generation mother glass is more than twice the size of the existing sixth-generation glass, resulting in improved production efficiency. The company will also present special content at CES to give visitors an experience of the size and capabilities of this new technology.\nOne notable feature is the ultra-thin (UT) panel. Samsung Display\u2019s UT OLED panels are about 0.6mm thick, similar to the thickness of a business card, which is one-third the thickness of an LCD panel. This difference is easily noticeable even to the naked eye. Additionally, the UT OLED panels are lightweight, with three UT OLED panels weighing the same as one LCD panel of the same size.\n\u201cBy applying a new module process, we have reduced the thickness while maintaining the same strength,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cWe are confident that this will help laptop and tablet manufacturers increase portability and differentiate their designs.\u201d\nMaterial advancements have led to the development of technology that reduces power consumption. Thin-film transistors (TFTs), which regulate current flow, now utilize 100% oxide instead of amorphous silicon (a-Si). This change allows for faster electron movement (about 10 times faster than with a-Si) and reduces current leakage. As a result, flickering, which occurs when a display is driven at a low refresh rate, can be eliminated. Samsung Display\u2019s latest products are the first IT panels to support variable refresh rates as low as 1Hz, enabling significant power savings.\nUnveiling OLEDoS: XR technology delivers industry-leading pixel density and brightness\nSamsung Display is the first to publicly introduce an RGB version of OLEDoS (OLED on Silicon). OLEDoS are high-definition displays with small pixel sizes, achieved by applying organic materials to silicon wafers. These displays will play a crucial role in XR headsets, which are growing in popularity.\nThis will be the highest resolution RGB OLEDoS display when compared to what is available in the industry currently. Despite its small size of 1.03 inches, it boasts a pixel density of 3500 PPI, comparable to a 4K TV. RGB OLEDoS utilizes red, green and blue OLEDs on a silicon wafer to generate colors without the need for a separate light source.\neMagin, the U.S.-based OLEDoS company acquired by Samsung Display, will showcase its products at the event. This includes its OLEDoS-enabled military helmets and night vision goggles.\nQD-OLED to become a \u2018monitor hero\u2018\nSamsung Display will demonstrate its competitive edge in the large-size display sector by introducing the highest quality self-illuminating, ultra-high-definition (UHD) OLED monitor and the world\u2019s first 360Hz OLED monitor.\nThe company is launching a new 31.5-inch UHD (3840x2160) QD-OLED monitor. It has the highest pixel density and UHD resolution among self-illuminating monitors. The pixel density is increased to 140 PPI (Pixel Per Inch), which is equivalent to the picture clarity of a 65-inch 8K TV. The refresh rate can go up to 240Hz.\nSamsung Display is set to introduce a 27-inch panel with a groundbreaking self-illuminating refresh rate of 360Hz, which is the highest amongst mass-produced panels. This high refresh rate, combined with the quick response time of QD-OLED technology, will enhance the immersive experience for activities like gaming and sports that involve rapid screen changes.\nSamsung Display has created an exhibition space to showcase its monitors. The monitors are not only for gaming and entertainment but also for professional use in video production and medical applications. With the slogan \u2018Better Performance! More Professional!\u2019, Samsung Display aims to expand its target market into these professional areas.\n\u201cThis is the year that Samsung Display\u2019s QD-OLEDs prove its unrivaled superiority in picture quality and establish themselves as \u2018monitor heroes,\u2019\u201d said a Samsung Display representative.\nThe TV panel has been upgraded to a brighter third-generation QD-OLED, which will be showcased at CES. This new version utilizes advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available, surpassing previous models. Each RGB color also sees a significant increase in brightness, approximately 50% more compared to last year\u2019s version.\nSamsung Display partnered with Pantone, a well-known color company, to ensure accurate color representation. Pantone is responsible for the Pantone Matching System (PMS), a widely recognized color standard that assigns a unique number to each color. This system allows for consistent color reproduction across different mediums and locations. At CES, attendees can compare the colors on the TV screen with Pantone\u2019s color chips to determine if the QD-OLEDs accurately reproduce colors. Samsung Display\u2019s QD-OLEDs are the first display to receive \u2018Pantone Validated\u2019, highlighting its commitment to delivering true-to-life colors.\n[Press Release] Samsung Display Begins Full-Scale OLED Supply for Premium Gaming Laptop Razer Blade 16\nNo next article.\nHeadquarter: 17113 Samseong-ro 1, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.\nPhone: +82-31-5181-1114\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SAMSUNG DISPLAY Co.,Ltd.
