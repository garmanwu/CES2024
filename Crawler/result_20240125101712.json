Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES.

Visitors can explore this cutting-edge innovation, along with upcoming releases and the complete product lineup, at the Dangbei exhibition at Booth 50965 in Halls A-D, Venetian Expo.\nThinner. Brighter. Smarter - Dangbei Atom\nAs Dangbei's first Google TV\u2122 laser projector with built-in Netflix, the Dangbei Atom stands out as one of the industry's first smart projectors to further upgrade the content ecosystem. Leveraging Google TV's content-first UI, it integrates diverse app content and personalized recommendations, streamlining the search for preferred shows. Google TV's features, including Watchlist, Multiple Profiles, Google Assistant, and Chromecast built-in, enhance the overall family entertainment experience, making the Atom's big screen entertainment more accessible, intelligent, and user-friendly.\nWith a brightness figure of up to 1200 ISO Lumens, the Dangbei Atom could well be the brightest projector on the market compared with other low form factor home cinema projectors. It deviates from the conventional expectation of high-brightness laser projectors typically being bulky in design. The Atom features ALPD laser technology for a bright, speckle- and color fringe-free 1080p image that reduces visual fatigue. In a compact 1.87-inch thick, 2.82 pound design, it effortlessly delivers a 180-inch big screen viewing experience in many locations at home.\nDangbei Atom improves color performance and intelligent image adjustment, offering users enhanced customization with three color temperature presets and RGB gain adjustments. Smart features like autofocus, auto keystone correction, and intelligent screen fit have been enhanced for faster and more accurate performance.\nThe Dangbei Atom will be available for pre-order in January on the\u00a0Dangbei official website for $899.99. To celebrate the launch, Dangbei will offer a $150 discount coupon.\u00a0Consumers can also purchase the product on Amazon after it is officially launched.\nNext Dimension in 4K Laser Home Cinema - Dangbei Mars Pro 2 & X5 Ultra\nAlong with the Dangbei Atom, visitors can also experience two upcoming 4K laser projectors set to debut in the international market. These include its first 4K laser projector with HDR10+ - the Dangbei Mars Pro 2, scheduled for release in the first half of 2024. It boasts a brightness of 2450 ISO lumens and dual 12W super powerful speakers supporting DTS:X.\nAnother innovation is\u00a0the first 4K projector with triple-color laser and full-color LED hybrid light sources. Visitors will be able to get a first-hand experience of its current Chinese version, the Dangbei X5 Ultra. Utilizing ALPD 5.0 laser technology, it achieves enhanced brightness and color improvements, covering 110% of the BT.2020 wide color gamut.\n4K Pad on the Go - Dangbei PadGO\nAside from projectors, Dangbei will unveil its future product line featuring the Dangbei PadGO, a 4K 27-inch movable large tablet. With a rollable stand, rotatable, and height-adjustable screen, it is suitable for watching dramas, listening to music, gaming, and working out in every room at home.\nDangbei aims to foster deep connections with partners, consumers, and other participants. Visit the Dangbei booth at CES 2024 to glimpse the future of home entertainment.\nLocation: Booth 50965, Halls A-D Venetian Expo\nDate: January 9-12, 2024\nDangbei will also attend the Pepcom event on January 8th in Las Vegas.

        "raw_content": "Dongguan transforms from world factory to technology hub\nDongguan has vowed to take scientific and technological innovation as its engine to drive the city's advanced manufacturing industry, becoming a brand-new blueprint for the future of the \"world factory\".\nDongguan, dubbed the \"factory of the world,\" in South China's Guangdong province, has witnessed huge changes in its upgraded industry distribution.\nPreviously, it heavily relied on low-margin processing trade and labor-intensive industries.\nNowadays, the traditional best-sellers in Dongguan's foreign trade, including clothing, shoes and hats, have been replaced by high value-added products such as smartphones, mechanical and electrical products that now account for more than 80 percent of Dongguan's total export value.\nThe founder of Dongguan's Yutong Optical Technology Co Ltd, or YTOT, was experienced in manufacturing optical lens in China. Last year, the professional optical lenses manufacturer's investment in R&D has increased year by year. In 2021, the total expenditure on R&D was 134 million yuan ($20.1 million), more than double the investment in 2020.\nWith a deep understanding of \"quality\" as the core competitiveness of enterprises in market competition, Yutong Optics insists on independent innovation and research and development and is committed to becoming the industry leader in producing optical lens.\nOver the past two decades, Edifier has grown from a small team of audio enthusiasts to an internationally recognized leader in audio solutions. Edifier products are now enjoyed by customers from over 70 countries and regions.\n\"We believe one thing: a passion for sound. Through research and innovation, we seek a bod design that\u2019s also intuitive to use\", said Li Xiaodong, secretary of the Board of Directors and vice general manager of Edifier.\nLi said that Edifier is also committed to creating a responsible business and giving back to the society. \"We help children with hearing impairments discover the magic of music, support young talents with scholarships and find innovative ways to protect the environment.\"\nDongguan's high-end manufacturing industry grew rapidly. In 2022, the spending on R&D in Dongguan accounted for 4.0 percent of its GDP. At present, there are 9,099 state-level high-tech enterprises in Dongguan, and the number is still growing in recent years.\nDongguan has promoted the digital transformation of over 5,100 industrial enterprises and driven 45,000 companies to move to the cloud. The industrial software and information industry in the city has grown by 118%, and the cluster of the intelligent mobile terminal industry has smoothly passed the national acceptance.\nBy the end of 2022, 42 industrial companies with a total registered capital of 350 million yuan ($54.8 million) have been incubated and established by the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, jointly built by the municipal government and a renowned research institute in China. Among them, 6 have been recognized as national high-tech enterprises.\nSongshan Lake Science City, where the joint lab is located, is planned to be built as a pilot area of a comprehensive national science center in the Greater Bay Area.\nThe lab is committed to studies on advanced science and the combination of science resources and local industrial development, which is expected to help the \"world factory\" further innovate and upgrade its industrial forms in the new era.\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

        "raw_content": "NTT Global Data Centers Plans Massive New Campus in Northern Virginia\nNTT Global Data Centers is expanding its presence in Northern Virginia with a massive new campus in Prince William County, the company said today. NTT has acquired property from Lerner Enterprises in Gainesville, Va. where it plans to develop 2 million square feet of data center space, supporting 336 megawatts (MWs) of capacity.\nThe 103-acre campus will provide room for long-term growth for NTT and its customers in Northern Virginia, where the company already operates a major campus in \u201cData Center Alley\u201d in Ashburn, the primary cloud hub in Loudoun County.\nNTT says the Gainesville project will become its single largest campus, with plans for four two-story data center buildings, with the first scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2024.\u00a0 The design will also offer \u201cdedicated self-contained areas for large-footprint deployments\u201d to support hyperscale clients.\n\u201cThe development of a new data center campus in Virginia is testament to our huge growth and momentum across North America\u201d said Doug Adams, President and CEO at NTT Global Data Centers Americas. \u201cThis strategic purchase of land is just one of the many steps we\u2019re taking to accelerate our data center footprint across the country.\u201d\nNTT Global Data Centers Americas is in the midst of a major expansion, with construction projects underway across the U.S. to add more capacity. The company has spent the past two years entering new markets, opening data center campuses in Hillsboro, Chicago, Santa Clara and Phoenix.\n\u201cThe development of our new campus in Virginia will be one of 14 ongoing projects taking place across the globe,\u201d said Masaaki Moribayashi, President and Board Director, NTT Ltd. \u201cBy 2025, it is estimated that 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms, up from 30% in 2021. As a result, the demand for data centers to support this shift has never been higher. As one of the largest data center providers in the world, NTT is well placed to support this reliance, and we\u2019re focused on supporting our customers as their needs continue to change,\u201d\nData Center Developers Look Beyond Ashburn\nNorthern Virginia has become the global capital for cloud computing, and is home to hundreds of data centers. That includes many hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, as well as data center developers who support their growth.\nData center development in Prince William County has accelerated in recent years as development parcels grow scarce near the regional data center hub in Ashburn in Loudoun County. There is now a growing cloud cluster near Manassas, and land speculation from developers has boosted property values, with recent transactions valuing data center development sites at nearly $1 million an acre.\nThere is now an estimated 5.3 million square feet of data center space in Prince William County, with another 8 million to 10 million square feet in the development pipeline, according to a recent report.\nThe NTT project is part of a data center building boom in Gainesville around the intersection of Route 66 and 29 (Lee Highway). The NTT property is across the highway from Gainesville Crossing, a large campus from Corscale that will feature 2.3 million square feet of data center space and 306MW of utility power.\nBoth projects are west of the proposed Prince William Digital Gateway, which could add millions of addition square feet of data centers and has generated lively debate about the appropriate location for future development in the county.\nNTT Accelerates Global Data Center Expansion\nThe Gainesville campus is part of an ongoing global expansion for NTT, which plans to increase its data center footprint to more than 1,000 MWs in 20 countries by the end of 2022. NTT says its data centers in Prince William will be sustainable, as part of the company\u2019s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions across its data center operations by 2030.\nIn addition to its U.S. campuses, NTT Global Data Centers recently announced the opening of data centers in Madrid, Navi Mumbai in India, and its largest data center in Indonesia in Jakarta. NTT Global Data Centers also has ongoing construction that will deliver new data centers in Germany, India, and Johannesburg later this year.\nIn the U.S., each campus is designed for multiple data centers, which allows customers who want contiguous space to easily add capacity in adjacent data halls or buildings. Here\u2019s a look at the company\u2019s US footprint:\nIn 2018 NTT Global (then known as RagingWire) launched its primary campus in Data Center Alley in Ashburn, shifting to greenfield construction, customized from the ground up to support the company\u2019s vision for Internet-scale campuses.\nThe first building, VA3, is a 16 MW data center featuring a mix of vault designs from 2 megawatts to 6 megawatts of power capacity, as well as a large room for multi-tenant retail colocation. VA4 and VA5 are 32-megawatt buildings with expanded and standardized vaults, and VA6 will feature NTT\u2019s new 36-megawatt design \u2013 two floors, with three 6-megawatt data halls on each floor.\nAt least three more data center buildings are planned for the Ashburn campus, totaling 224 megawatts of capacity. The Prince William campus will be 50 percent larger, providing a next phase of growth for NTT and its clients from 2024 forward.\nHaving capacity can provide an advantage, especially as customers seek accelerated delivery timelines to meet demand for cloud services.\n\u201cOne of the things our client base has told us that they appreciate how we build ahead in our markets,\u201d said Adams in a recent conversation with DCF.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nAmazon Plans Major Data Center Expansion in Virginia's Spotsylvania County\nDCF Tours: NTT Global Data Centers Americas' Dallas TX1, Garland, Texas\nSponsored Recommendations\nData-driven Asset Performance Management White Paper\nA Guide to Understanding the NFPA 70B Code Changes\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled\nVoices of the Industry\nJumpstarting your Data Center Decarbonization Journey\nLatest in Cloud\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nScorecard: Looking Back at Data Center Frontier\u2019s 2023 Industry Predictions\nThe Top Data Center Industry Stories of 2023\nWhite Papers\nThe Data Center Edge of Tomorrow: Five Critical Ways Digital Twins and AI Will Impact the Network\nSponsored\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nIoT EcoStruxure Ensures Continued Learning at Bainbridge Island School District\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled"

The land was (or possibly still is) owned by SDC Ashburn I LLC, itself owned by SDC Capital Partners; The land is also connected to SDC\u2019s Sentinel Data Centers.
