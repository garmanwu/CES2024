Here are our picks for the most noteworthy products and trends at CES 2024, including versatile laptops, a handheld generative AI assistant, elegant TVs and mixed reality for immersive training or meetings.\n1. Generative AI integrates with laptops and apps\nGenerative AI like ChatGPT has become the hottest thing in tech over the last year, so it\u2019s not a surprise that generative AI is present at CES in a big way.\nWindows 11 laptops from Dell and other manufacturers will have a dedicated Windows for Copilot button for Microsoft\u2019s natural language AI assistant.\nIntel, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA are working on building the capacity to run generative AI directly into their hardware. NVIDIA debuted Chat with RTX, which is a demo app for personalizing a generative AI model to search through content including chats, documents and videos on a Windows RTX PC or workstation.\nGenerative AI in retail at CES 2024\nIn addition, generative AI appeared in retail applications at CES 2024, with Walmart debuting it on a \u201csocial commerce platform\u201d called Shop With Friends.\nVolkswagen puts ChatGPT in cars\nVolkswagen is putting ChatGPT into its cars, allowing a busy professional to ask the generative AI to perform tasks while on the go. It\u2019s hard to say whether these use cases will prove as or more desirable than existing voice-based (but not generative) AI assistants in the long term.\n2. Productivity gadgets emphasize speed and ease\nThe hottest gadget at CES 2024 was the Rabbit R1 (Figure A), a handheld, generative AI-based device that could not only revolutionize the way people interact with apps but possibly replace the smartphone as a person\u2019s primary screen.\nThe R1, which is currently available to pre-order for $199, runs on what Rabbit calls a Large Action Model, as opposed to a large language model. The user can speak a command (e.g., \u201cBook a flight\u201d) and the R1 will simply do it without the user needing to open an app or the device needing to connect to an app using an API.\nThe Rabbit R1 is the most dramatic instance of the major productivity trend at CES 2024 of letting generative AI be the interface between the user and their tasks, making the online services and decisions in between essentially invisible.\nSEE: While ChatGPT was integrated with other tech at CES 2024, OpenAI opened the GPT Store. (TechRepublic)\n3D and wireless monitors provide more screen options\nLenovo debuted its Lenovo ThinkVision 27 3D monitor, which lets users transform 2D images into 3D content quickly; this could be a productivity boost for creative professionals. Meanwhile, Samsung introduced a new cable-free multi-monitor setup that won CES 2024 Best of Innovation in computer peripherals and accessories.\nWi-Fi 7 is proliferating\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance is starting to roll out certifications for Wi-Fi 7, meaning more devices will be able to run Wi-Fi 7\u2019s higher data throughputs for applications like virtual reality. TP-Link, UniFi, MSI and Acer released Wi-Fi 7 routers at the show.\nMore about Innovation\n3. Multiple-in-1 laptops give professionals options\nSeveral laptops that double as tablets were highlights of CES 2024. For instance, HP\u2019s Spectre x360 2-in-1 Laptop PC and Dell\u2019s new XPS line were both shown off.\nASUS introduced the Zenbook DUO (2024) UX8406 (Figure B), which comes with two screens and a keyboard and can convert into five modes total: a laptop with keyboard, two touch screens, dual screen, desktop mode (depending on whether the screens are oriented to the keyboard horizontally or vertically) or sharing mode (using both screens to show data or presentations).\n4. Qualcomm, automakers and others promote virtual and mixed reality products\nQualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip is expected to appear in a Samsung virtual or mixed reality headset later this month. Qualcomm has already released a reference device that could compete with the Apple Vision Pro.\nMixed and virtual reality were elsewhere at CES, too, with BMW researching mixed reality glasses for driving.\n5. Curved and transparent TV screens catch the eye\nA transparent TV screen could be an impressive set piece for a home office, turning into an art object instead of just a black rectangle when you\u2019re not using it. The Samsung Transparent MICRO LED and the LG Signature OLED T (Figure C) are showstoppers.\nA wide variety of large, curved monitors for gaming were shown off at CES 2024. Another trend was reducing glare on TVs, such as with the glare-free coating on the Samsung S95D OLED TV.\nEditor\u2019s note: TechRepublic is covering CES 2024 remotely.\nSubscribe to the Innovation Insider Newsletter\nCatch up on the latest tech innovations that are changing the world, including IoT, 5G, the latest about phones, security, smart cities, AI, robotics, and more.

Of these, 78,300 jobs will be dedicated to the organization (transport, events, communication, etc.), 60,000 to tourism (hotels and restaurants, etc.), and 11,700 to construction.\nThe Ministry of Labor and Employment also intends to mobilize the resources of the skills investment plan (amounting to \u20ac1 billion) to support employment integration projects for the Games. Paris 2024 has set the objective that 10% of the hours worked on the construction sites should be dedicated to people far from employment. Moreover, P\u00f4le Emploi creates a virtual agency emplois2024.fr (in French) for the occasion and lists all the available jobs. The Ministry also wants to meet the skills needs for the preparation and running of the Olympic Games by investing in the creation or development of Apprentice Training Centres (CFA).

Kelley, CTA Vice President and CES Show Director. \u201cWe are excited to bring the CES 2024 Tech Trends to FDDay to highlight topics critical to our industry \u2013 from new market research to technology\u2019s impact on climate solutions \u2013 and how these trends will be a focus at CES 2024 in January.\u201d\nThe CES 2024 Tech Trends will feature conference programming focused on the latest market research, global tech trends, entrepreneurship, its global impact, and what to expect at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. CES 2024 Tech Trends will replace CES Unveiled Paris and will not include CES exhibits.\nFDDay is the best place for founders to be inspired, network with their peers, and close deals with future partners. In 2023, the event will bring together more than 5,000 entrepreneurs, investors, innovation leaders, and tech decision-makers for a unique \u201cfamily reunion\u201d to accelerate European technology solutions and advance innovation across the globe.\nThe theme for the 2023 event is ONE \u2013 building a new age for European innovators, playing as one team, to solve technological, environmental, and societal challenges.\n\u201cWe are convinced that French and European innovations, because of their commitment to have a positive impact on our societies, represent a major asset for the global tech ecosystem, for which CES is one of the greatest ambassadors,\u201d said Maya No\u00ebl, Managing Director of France Digitale. \u00a0\u201cAs our goal at France Digitale is to help build European tech champions, it made complete sense for us to host the CES 2024 Tech Trends. By joining forces with CTA, we want to provide a unique view on global tech trends, confirm France's place as an innovation leader, and offer new opportunities for European startups to bring their impact internationally.\u201d\n\u201cAfter having federated thousands of innovators and investors for a decade, France Digitale sets new ambitions for the next decade with this partnership: We want to support the international growth of our ecosystem and establish Europe as a leader in responsible innovation and impact solutions,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella, France Digitale\u2019s copresident, Founder of BlaBlaCar and Captain Cause.\nFrench innovation is a critical component of the advancement of the global technology industry.
