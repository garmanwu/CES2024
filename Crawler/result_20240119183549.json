Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Embracing the AI Evolution and Other New Age Electronics Trends\nThis week is CES 2024, the world\u2019s premier gathering for consumer technology, which means the industry is buzzing with trends and the latest unveilings that will revolutionize the way we interact with technology. Businesses and consumers from across the globe will gather in Las Vegas for the annual event showcasing the cutting-edge technologies that will shape our lives in the years to come.\nWith a legacy spanning over five decades, CES has been the epicenter of groundbreaking advancements, offering a glimpse into the future of technology. Since its inception in 1967, this annual extravaganza has evolved from presenting the latest transistor radios to a global stage where tech titans and startups alike converge to unveil their latest creations.\nCES has become synonymous with unveiling groundbreaking products and services across diverse sectors, from artificial intelligence and robotics to augmented reality and smart home solutions. The latest technology in TVs, transportation, laptops, smart homes, gaming, phones, and wearables are just a few of the products expected at CES 2024.\nSo, it comes as no surprise that TD SYNNEX will be on the ground, leading the way for partners and the technology industry to bring this technology to market worldwide. With so much anticipation, we spoke with the TD SYNNEX New Age Electronics group about what to expect at CES 2024 and how TD SYNNEX is leading the way.\nAI Innovation and Solutions Continue to Dominate\nIn 2022, healthcare solutions were front and center at CES as the world continued to deal with the COVID crisis. Data-driven biosensors, remote patient monitoring, and AI and Machine Learning to bridge the gap between clinical care and self-care were just a few of the technology trends making waves.\nJust a year ago, artificial intelligence was gaining traction at CES 2023, featuring the latest AI-powered gadgets and solutions hitting the marketplace. With the launch of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and others becoming more mainstream in recent months, AI will once again be the focus at CES.\nSenior Vice President of Retail Sales for TD SYNNEX New Age Electronics, Eric Kirkendall, anticipates that \u201cAI will be the dominant theme throughout\u201d CES 2024. He added that a new category of PCs integrating AI-powered technology and solutions will be a hot-ticket item throughout the week.\n\u201cAI and AI-powered solutions are technologies that consumers are becoming more comfortable with, so integrating them into the tools consumers use on a daily basis is a big focus.

        "raw_content": "Top 5 Tech Predictions for 2024\nAs you might expect, the rise of artificial intelligence in the IT ecosystem is undoubtedly the low-hanging fruit of 2024 technology predictions, but it remains critical for us to learn its potential and, more importantly, anticipate how to monetize its capabilities in the channel.\nAs we close a rollercoaster 2023, we reached out to our TD SYNNEX leadership staff, comprised of CRN Channel Chiefs, Women of the Channel and award-winning thought leaders who keep a constant pulse on tech, to get their take on what to expect in 2024. We asked for their boldest takes on the biggest surprises to expect in the new year.\n1 \u2013 AI Will Accelerate Productivity and Efficiency Even More Than Expectations\nIf you thought AI was the term of the year, you\u2019re probably right and we won\u2019t be surprised to be saying the exact same thing a year from now.\nThe emergence of generative AI is already revolutionizing how we do our jobs, whether its through automation of tasks, generation of content at scale or boosting creativity while in a rut. Companion apps like Microsoft Copilot are already providing assistance to everyday tasks for enterprise co-workers, and the technology is only getting better. Amazingly, we\u2019re only scratching the surface of generative AI\u2019s capabilities and over the course of the next year, AI will make an even bigger splash:\n\u201cAI will take another massive leap in usage, especially by the everyday worker. This will lead to higher productivity by some who use it effectively, [but] could lead to the reduction in creative thought as we pass that skill to the AI tools.\u201d\nIT ecosystem organizations that master the abilities of generative AI will start to earn a competitive edge over those who fall behind:\n\u201cIT solution providers that master generative AI will establish a commanding competitive lead by crafting cutting-edge solutions that harness AI\u2019s power for automation, personalization, and enhanced customer engagement. Their growth will outpace those lagging behind, and this gap is projected to widen as generative AI permeates the industry mainstream.\u201d\nSo, what can the channel do to find the optimal balance between core technologies and the rise of AI?\n\u201c[My] prediction for 2024 is the integration of AI and ML models into a large percentage of existing software solutions. This will drive increases in productivity and operational efficiency across multiple use cases and areas.\u201d\nAs AI starts to drive operational efficiencies, channel partners will have more freedom to shift their focus to driving business outcomes:\n\u201cAI ISV innovation [will be] everywhere; we are the hardware engine behind Vision AI and we will continue expanding our reach to other growth markets like Cyber AI and Analytics AI. We will continue investing our custom hardware offerings that aligns with ISVs requirements and provide a turnkey model. This will allow ISVs to focus on software development and provide a full solution to their partners.\u201d\n2 \u2013 IT Selling Models Will Evolve to Incorporate More Services\nAs presented in the 2023 TD SYNNEX Direction of Technology Report and its complementary MSP Special Report, channel partners are already charting their journey toward managed services. 50% of survey respondents in this year\u2019s survey identified as a managed service provider (MSP) and 38% of respondents identified managed services as a top skill they are hiring for in the next 12-24 months, both trends that mirror industry-wide market analyses, which find that the market for MSPs is expanding exponentially.\nWith this change, the industry can no longer operate like it always has in the past, and that means new sales and deployment models:\n\u201cServices will become the lead-in for partners as they work to transform their selling models to meet the needs of the market. Partner-delivered services will play a \u2018tip of the spear\u2019 role from an opportunity standpoint. The gaps in cybersecurity skills will drive an enhanced need for partners to leverage/outsource their services.\u201d\nThis shift toward managed services will open a tremendous opportunity for organizations that invest in the right skill sets over the next year:\n\u201cThe focus on AI and specifically the emergence of Gen AI will propel new types of ecosystem partners that will evolve and invest in skill sets to participate in new end user opportunities that drive efficiency and use cases across industries leveraging Gen AI. As an example, we will see an evolution of AI MSPs to support data modeling, security, and compliance in regulatory areas.\u201d\n3 \u2013 Blockchain Technology Will (Re)Rise with Increased Attention on Cybersecurity\nYou probably saw \u201cblockchain\u201d in plenty of 2018 predictions articles, but you probably didn\u2019t expect to see it again in 2024. However, with cybersecurity cementing its place as a necessity in all verticals, there are new use cases for blockchain use:\n\u201cThe (re)rise of blockchain technology. Specifically, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) which operate on blockchain technology. DAOs utilize smart contracts for decision making and are managed without centralized control. This could completely change how organizations are structured and how decisions are made.\u201d\nIn the cybersecurity industry, AI is being leveraged to strengthen security solutions for individuals and businesses. Unfortunately, that also means threat actors are equally using AI in their own malicious tactics to infiltrate valuable data and information.\n\u201cThe rise in AI will drive increased security spend (especially in incident response category) as AI-driven attacks become more sophisticated, making them tougher to defend against. This, coupled with the increasing gap in cybersecurity skills across the market, will drive enhanced focus and spend to ensure solid remediation plans and products are in place.\u201d\nThe ultimate outcome as cybersecurity pairs with core advanced solutions and modern infrastructure will be to drive organizations toward true digital transformation:\n\u201cConvergence of Cloud, Security, Data combined capabilities and practices \u2013 which are the primary technologies drivers of Digital Transformation (DX) \u2013 will continue to accelerate. This acceleration is driven by the massive market opportunity of DX which is projected to reach $4T by 2027 at 16% CAGR (IDC).\u201d\n4 \u2013 Election Year Presents Opportunities in the Public Sector and Other Markets\n2024 represents a US election year, which historically is a good sign for public sector technology growth:\n\u201cI think we will see faster adoption or catch-up by the public sector. This is a factor of it being an election year, which will increase spend and drive opportunities.\u201d\nOther industries, like the healthcare sector, may also see growth in 2024 as a result of significant impact from the rise of AI technologies:\n\u201cHealthcare has traditionally been a technology laggard, but as we look at the impact of AI, we see relevant, immediate use cases being adopted by healthcare in 2024. AI will be disruptive in a number of traditional industries like printing, manufacturing and supply chain, education, banking, legal as the art of the possible to automate, changes how these conventional industries operate and provide services to their customers.\u201d\nReza Honarmand took the legal vertical as a prime example of how generative AI can revolutionize the way legal professionals operate (as long as they\u2019re doing it the right way):\n\u201cWithin the legal sector, generative AI will automate tasks like contract drafting, analysis, and dispute resolution. This will reshape the roles of legal professionals and potentially impact the integrity of the legal system.\u201d\n5 \u2013 The Endpoint Device and Accessories Market Has a Reason to Rebound\nNotably, 2023 represented a down year for the endpoint and device market, but a rebound could be on the horizon.\nWe\u2019ve become accustomed to generative AI in the form of software and programs; in the coming year, we\u2019re likely to see an emergence of AI PCs, where AI and ML capabilities are built directly into the processor for faster speeds and the smartest computing we\u2019ve ever had available at the consumer level. The launch of AI PCs could represent the much-needed reboot that the device market needs.\n\u201cAs we see AI at the desktop, that may open up more opportunities around AI devices, better networking and more innovation in mobility.\u201d\nThis introduction of AI at the PC level presents monetization opportunities for the channel:\n\u201cThe introduction of AI is likely to accelerate the growth of Hyperscaler services, the launch of AI PCs, and significantly increase service opportunities for partners in managed services, adoption, and implementation. The monetization will start but will be lower than expected and several current manual activities will start to be replace for automation.\u201d\nWhat technology trends do you expect to grow in 2024?

        "raw_content": "Press Releases\nTD SYNNEX Releases Global Technology Ecosystem Benchmark Report Highlighting Industry Trends and Opportunities\nTech businesses could leave $400 billion in untapped revenue in the AR/VR market\nFREMONT, Calif. & CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nTD SYNNEX (NYSE: SNX) has released its inaugural Global Technology Ecosystem Benchmark Report, highlighting critical industry trends and opportunities for 2023 and beyond. The first global report of its kind, the TD SYNNEX Global Technology Ecosystem Benchmark Report follows regional industry benchmark studies in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan, and Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe report reflects TD SYNNEX\u2019s role at the center of a global ecosystem connecting technology producers, resellers, service providers, systems integrators, industry specialists and end-users.\n\u201cAs a leading IT ecosystem distributor and solutions aggregator, we have an opportunity and responsibility to help our channel partners identify industry trends as they navigate relentless transformation and plan for strategic growth,\u201d said TD SYNNEX Chief Strategy Officer Sergio Farache. \u201cThe Global Ecosystem Benchmark Report is an important milestone in defining and understanding what\u2019s happening in this globally connected IT ecosystem.\u201d\nBuilding on the North American, European, Latin American and Caribbean and Asia Pacific and Japan regional benchmark studies, the Global Insights Report focuses on three fundamental factors for technology ecosystem businesses:\nThe survey covered a range of topics from growth strategies and business challenges to customer needs and strategic investments, revealing five critical insights:\nInsight 1: Globally, technology resellers\u2019 strategic growth plans prioritize entering new vertical markets. Additionally, increased ecosystem partnerships are likely to be integral in executing on this growth strategy.\nRegulated verticals like financial services, government, education, healthcare and ESG are all expected to increase in importance over three years. Gaining the experience in these categories and delivering the technology solutions requires expertise that\u2019s hard to scale, which means partnerships can close functional gaps to deliver desired outcomes.\nInsight 2: Resellers are putting their investments in people to drive the outcomes customers want most.\nThe largest categories of reseller business investments are directly linked to acquiring skills, certification, and expertise. More than three-quarters of resellers globally are prioritizing budgets to increase knowledge in technical and business solutions areas customers frequently request, including Managed Services, Security Networking, Professional Services, Servers + Storage, and Hybrid Cloud, among others.\nInsight 3: Resellers are shifting resources to expand their cloud portfolios.\nWhen viewed as a single category, cloud solutions (cloud deployment, cloud integration, multi-cloud management, and others) eclipse all other technology solutions resellers conveyed that they plan to offer in the next 24 months, according to the Global Benchmark Report. Other top responses have a clear tie to cloud priorities (device as a service, digital transformation, IoT, security) making cloud solutions fundamental to global resellers\u2019 portfolio of offering.\nInsight 4: Global resellers are consumed by As-a-Service.\nThe near total adoption of As-a-Service consumption models resellers plan over the next two years is a short leap in logic from reseller\u2019s responsiveness to customers\u2019 technology solutions needs and the intended expansion of cloud offerings. Customers have always indicated they want flexibility when it comes to payment terms. The trend toward OpEx and consumption-based IT means a larger portion of resellers\u2019 business is likely to come from recurring revenue.\nInsight 5: ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and the AR/VR market are potential missed opportunities for resellers.\nIn contrast to the emphasis on skills acquisition, portfolio expansion and efforts to enter new vertical markets, sustainability and emerging technology are low on the priority list for solution development and business investment.\nIn different capacities, ESG and AR/VR solutions are both opportunities for global resellers.\nEffective ESG programs allow organizations to respond to partner and customer questions about sustainable practices and diversity, as well as comply with supplier codes of conduct, while some analysts forecast an AR/VR market opportunity of $800 billion by 2024, where 50% of that revenue is associated to technology platforms and hardware.\nThe full TD SYNNEX Global IT Ecosystem Benchmark Report, including an executive summary, is available for download.\nSurvey Methodology\nIn partnership with Canalys, TD SYNNEX surveyed approximately 300 mid-size technology ecosystem partners across North and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific countries. Mid-size technology ecosystem partner is defined as 1,000 seats and below. Fieldwork for the Global Insights Report was conducted between July and October 2022.\nAbout TD SYNNEX\nTD SYNNEX (NYSE: SNX) is a leading global distributor and solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem.

Financial results adjusted for constant currency are calculated by translating current period activity using the comparable prior year periods\u2019 currency conversion rate. TD SYNNEX uses non-GAAP gross billings, which adjusts revenues to exclude costs related to sales of third-party supplier service contracts, software as a service arrangements and certain fulfillment contracts. Non-GAAP gross billings are a useful non-GAAP metric in understanding the volume of our business activity and serve as an important performance metric in internally managing our operations. TD SYNNEX uses non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin which exclude purchase accounting adjustments. TD SYNNEX also uses adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, the amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments, legal settlements and other litigation, net, the related tax effects thereon and an income tax capital loss carryback benefit. Further, the Company uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") which excludes other income (expense), net, acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, share-based compensation expense and purchase accounting adjustments. In prior periods, TD SYNNEX has excluded other items relevant to those periods for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures.\nAcquisition, integration and restructuring costs, which are expensed as incurred, primarily represent professional services costs for legal, banking, consulting and advisory services, severance and other personnel-related costs, share-based compensation expense and debt extinguishment fees that are incurred in connection with acquisition, integration, restructuring, and divestiture activities. From time to time, this category may also include transaction-related gains/losses on divestitures/spin-off of businesses, costs related to long-lived assets including impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization expense due to changes in asset useful lives, as well as various other costs associated with the acquisition or divestiture.\nTD SYNNEX\u2019s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of finite-lived intangible assets which consist primarily of customer relationships and vendor lists. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company\u2019s Statements of Operations. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company\u2019s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the sale of the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company\u2019s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business nor reflect the Company\u2019s underlying business performance, enhances the Company\u2019s and investors\u2019 ability to compare the Company\u2019s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company\u2019s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\nShare-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of equity awards to employees and non-employee members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors based on the estimated fair value of those awards. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees, the fair value of the share-based awards may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards and the expense can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Given the variety and timing of awards and the subjective assumptions that are necessary when calculating share-based compensation expense, TD SYNNEX believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results from period to period.\nPurchase accounting adjustments are primarily related to the impact of recognizing the acquired vendor and customer liabilities related to the merger with Tech Data at fair value. These adjustments benefited our non-GAAP operating income through the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 based on historical settlement patterns with our vendors and in accordance with the timing defined in our policy for releasing vendor and customer liabilities we deem remote to be paid.\nLegal settlements and other litigation, net includes a benefit recorded in other income (expense), net during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 resulting from a decrease in our accrual for a legal matter in France.\nIn connection with the merger with Tech Data, the Company restructured its foreign financing structure, as well as select legal entities in anticipation of legally integrating legacy Tech Data and SYNNEX foreign operations. In addition to the treasury efficiencies, these restructurings resulted in a one-time domestic capital loss which would offset certain domestic capital gains when carried back under United States tax law, resulting in an income tax capital loss carryback benefit.\nTrailing fiscal four quarters ROIC is defined as the last four quarters\u2019 tax effected operating income divided by the average of the last five quarterly balances of borrowings and equity, net of cash. Adjusted ROIC is calculated by excluding the tax effected impact of non-GAAP adjustments from operating income and by excluding the cumulative tax effected impact of current and prior period non-GAAP adjustments on equity.\nTD SYNNEX also uses free cash flow, which is cash flow from operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. TD SYNNEX uses free cash flow to conduct and evaluate its business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, TD SYNNEX believes it is an additional useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing TD SYNNEX\u2019s liquidity that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations as it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, TD SYNNEX believes it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to its entire Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTD SYNNEX management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business, to establish operational goals, and in some cases for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide investors with an understanding of TD SYNNEX\u2019s operational results and trends that more readily enable investors to analyze TD SYNNEX\u2019s base financial and operating performance and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of operational trends, as well as for planning and forecasting in future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with TD SYNNEX\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of TD SYNNEX\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is set forth in the supplemental tables at the end of this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nStatements in this news release regarding TD SYNNEX that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

        "raw_content": "Buy Rating on TD SYNNEX: Strong Earnings and Positive 2024 Outlook Propel Upward Price Target Revision\nBarrington analyst Vincent Colicchio has maintained their bullish\nstance on SNX stock, giving a Buy rating today.\nVincent Colicchio has assigned a Buy rating to TD SYNNEX Corporation for several reasons, including a robust earnings performance and a positive outlook for demand in 2024. In the fiscal Q4/23, TD SYNNEX\u2019s non-GAAP EPS outperformed expectations, reporting at $3.13, which was significantly higher than both Barrington\u2019s and FactSet\u2019s consensus forecast. The company achieved this result through a better-than-expected adjusted operating margin, reduced interest expenses, and a favorable non-GAAP tax rate, which compensated for a slight revenue shortfall.\nAdditionally, Colicchio anticipates an improvement in revenue growth for fiscal 2024, driven by expected demand for high-growth technology and a recovery in endpoint solutions. The forecasted EPS for 2024 has been revised upwards, supported by lower projected interest expenses. With these factors in mind, Colicchio has increased the 12-month price target for SNX shares, indicating a strong conviction in the company\u2019s potential for outperformance and an attractive investment opportunity based on the adjusted EBITDA forecast and net debt considerations.\nIn another report released today, Stifel Nicolaus also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $120.00 price target.\nSee the top stocks recommended by analysts >>\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.

So we believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a great start in that category. But that is the new area that everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about, and we feel as if our history puts us in a great position to really take advantage of being in the front of the market in the AI segment moving forward,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 TD Synnex CEO Rich Hume tells CRN.\nShaking Off PC Business Issues\nNumberswise, the fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 and full fiscal year 2023 looked tough for TD Synnex, with revenue and both GAAP and non-GAAP net income down over the comparable periods of fiscal 2022.\nHowever, according to Rich Hume, CEO of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest IT distributor, with dual headquarters in Fremont, Calif., and Clearwater, Fla., fiscal 2023 was actually a good year, with financials about what they were expected to be as TD Synnex moves past issues in the PC business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been moving through this PC ecosystem decline that has been occurring all year long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hume told CRN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We said that as we move through time, those declines would become less, which is actually what transpired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n[Related: TD Synnex CEO Rich Hume: AI A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMassive Opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 For The Channel]\nLooking ahead, impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic are having what may be their final appearance, Hume said.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So let me start with the first half of the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe that PC sales will start to grow. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working off the tougher comparison for our Advanced Solutions business. And then in the second half of the year, what I would refer to as the COVID adjustment for the PC and Advanced Solutions categories, will be largely behind us. So we would anticipate broad growth across the business in the second half of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nGoing forward, TD Synnex will expand its focus on more advanced technologies, and in particular on AI and the cloud, Hume said.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We today have about 40 vendors that will make us kind of overweight, if you will, in AI,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a great start in that category. But that is the new area that everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about, and we feel as if our history puts us in a great position to really take advantage of being in the front of the market in the AI segment moving forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nTD Synnex By The Numbers\nFor its fourth fiscal quarter 2023, which ended Nov. 30, TD Synnex reported revenue of $14.41 billion, down 11.3 percent from the $16.25 billion the company reported for its fourth fiscal quarter 2022.\nThat was $40 million lower than analyst expectations, according to Seeking Alpha.\nThis included Americas revenue of $8.4 billion, down from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10.0 billion; European revenue of $5.2 billion, down from $5.4 billion; and Asia-Pacific and Japan revenue of $838 million, slightly up from $834 million.\nFor the quarter, TD Synnex also reported GAAP net income of $187.5 million, or $2.06 per share, down from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $221.23 million, or $2.31 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported $285.6 million, or $3.13 per share, down from $329.8 million, or $3.44 per share.\nNon-GAAP earnings beat analyst expectations by 46 cents per share, according to Seeking Alpha.\nFor all of fiscal 2023, TD Synnex reported revenue of $57.56 billion, down 7.7 percent from the $62.34 billion it reported for fiscal 2022.\nAmericas revenue for the year was $34.57 billion, down from $38.79 billion. European revenue was $19.42 billion, down from $20.29 billion. And Asia-Pacific and Japan revenue was $3.6 billion, up from $3.3 billion.\nLooking forward, TD Synnex expects first fiscal quarter 2024 revenue of $14.0 billion to $14.7 billion, compared with the distributor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first fiscal quarter 2023 revenue of $15.1 billion.\nTD Synnex also expects GAAP net income of $147 million to $192 million, compared with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $167.0 million, and non-GAAP net income of $232 million to $277 million compared with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $279.2 million.\nHere is more of what Hume had to say in an interview with CRN.\nTD Synnex reported Americas revenue down 16 percent to 17 percent year over year for the fourth quarter. What happened?\nHume: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without getting too far into it, actually, the gross billings were only down about 9 percent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the accounting for certain transactions that net down. So typically, software would be in the category of things that get netted down, or part of our Hyve [integration] businesses where the goods are consigned but we still provide the service and make the same profitability. So from what was billed in perspective to the customers, there was a 9 percent delta there, so 17 percent becomes 8 percent. Our gross billings were actually at the high end of our guidance range. And the revenue was just below the midpoint of the guidance range. So all of this is within the context of expectations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nBut that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down 8 percent. What caused that the drop?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As you know, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been moving through this PC ecosystem decline that has been occurring all year long. We said that as we move through time, those declines would become less, which is actually what transpired. And in addition to that, our Advanced Solutions business, some of its growth in the past has been fueled by a backlog. The backlog is now sort of run down, and the Advanced Solutions business is sort of a flattish category, if you will. So as we look forward, what we said is we would anticipate that our billings and revenue in the first half of this coming year would be flattish, and then we anticipate the back half of the year to have a mid- to high-single-digit growth. So much like what many are talking about in the industry, we think that as we move through the FY \u00e2\u20ac\u212224 time frame, it starts out a bit tepid or weaker, and then will improve as we move through the year. And again, it is important to note that all this is in the context of the guidance that we had previously provided to the market.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So for fiscal \u00e2\u20ac\u212224, softer first half, and we expect the first half of the year for things to be flattish, and in the second half we would anticipate mid- to high-single-digit growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nSo what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to lead the growth of the second half of the year?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So let me start with the first half of the year. We believe that PC sales will start to grow. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working off the tougher comparison for our Advanced Solutions business. And then in the second half of the year, what I would refer to as the COVID adjustment for the PC and Advanced Solutions categories, will be largely behind us. So we would anticipate broad growth across the business in the second half of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAs you look at the second half of 2024, what are the strategic priorities of TD Synnex?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not a surprise: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-growth technology. So hybrid cloud, analytics, AI, cybersecurity and hyperscale infrastructure. These are the markets that are outpacing the overall IT market. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to keep ourselves steadfastly focused on those categories, along with, obviously, all of the infrastructure and PC ecosystem stuff we do. But we would anticipate those areas showing a bit of higher growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAnd for the second half of 2024, do you see TD Synnex engaging in any new programs or technologies that you want to bring to your channel partner customers?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, obviously, the thing that everyone is talking about right now is AI. We've had the benefit of having built an analytics practice that is 10 years in the making. It actually originated with our acquisition of Avnet Technology Solutions back in the day. And we have since adopted our analytics practice globally and broadly. And what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important about that is the foundation of AI is data. And so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the privilege of having many analytics vendors on our line card. And we today have about 40 vendors that will make us kind of overweight, if you will, in AI. So we believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a great start in that category. But that is the new area that everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about, and we feel as if our history puts us in a great position to really take advantage of being in the front of the market in the AI segment moving forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAny other big initiatives for 2024?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Again, we want to focus on high-growth technologies and on continuing to advance our cloud platform. Because as we move through time, there are more customer requirements around that platform, and we feel as if we have a great baseline, and we will accelerate investment and capabilities within that platform as we move throughout the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nLooking beyond TD Synnex, how do you see the state of distribution overall?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, I see the state of distribution as being quite healthy and quite vital moving into the future. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 40-plus years into this as a category, not just TD Synnex, but some of our competitors. And every day, our vendors are after us to help them to do more and more and more. As new technologies emerge, they first make their way into large enterprises, then they get packaged and make their way into what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll call the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvolume\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 part of the market, the small and midsize part of the market. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the channel really performs. And I think that the demands on distribution and the business partner ecosystem in total by our vendors get greater through time, and we fully intend to respond to those requirements and really help the entire ecosystem to benefit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"

We thank the Human Rights Campaign for recognizing our efforts to create a workplace environment where all co-workers can be who they are, explore their potential and know they belong.\u201d\n\u201cFor well over two decades, businesses have played an important role in furthering LGBTQ+ equality by centering employee needs and voices when it comes to workplace inclusion. While there is much more work to be done, year-over-year growth in CEI participation is evidence of a business community that recognizes the responsibility and value in upholding equity and inclusion,\u201d said RaShawn \u201cShawnie\u201d Hawkins, Human Rights Campaign Sr Director of Workplace Equality. \u201cOur goal at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation is to work in a spirit of partnership with companies, providing educational resources and leading benchmarking, and collaborating on ways for businesses to support the LGBTQ+ community at a time when we face unprecedented legislative attacks, heightened anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and physical violence. The CEI is an ever-evolving tool \u2013 a blueprint that companies can use to show up more effectively in supporting their LGBTQ+ employees and their families.\u201d\nThe results of the 2023-2024 CEI showcase how U.S.-based companies are promoting LGBTQ+ friendly workplace policies in the U.S. and abroad. The first year of the CEI included 319 participants, and the 2023-2024 CEI now includes 1,384 participants; further demonstrating the tremendous trajectory of the CEI, a record-breaking 1,340 businesses have non-discrimination protections specific to gender identity, up from just 17 in 2002. These critical non-discrimination protections cover 21 million employees in the U.S. and around the globe. TD SYNNEX\u2019s efforts in satisfying all the CEI\u2019s criteria earned a score of 100 and the designation as recipient of the Equality 100 Award: Leader in LGBTQ+ Workplace Inclusion. TD SYNNEX joins the ranks of 545 major U.S. businesses that also earned top marks this year.\nThe CEI rates employers providing these crucial protections to over 20 million U.S. workers and an additional 18 million outside of the U.S. Companies rated in the CEI include Fortune magazine\u2019s 500 largest publicly traded businesses, American Lawyer magazine\u2019s top 200 revenue-grossing law firms (AmLaw 200), and hundreds of publicly and privately held mid- to large-sized businesses.\nThe CEI assessment focuses on:\nThe full report is available online at www.hrc.org/cei.\nAbout The Human Rights Campaign\nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation is the educational arm of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) people. Through its programs, the HRC Foundation seeks to make transformational change in the everyday lives of LGBTQ+ people, shedding light on inequity and deepening the public\u2019s understanding of LGBTQ+ issues, with a clear focus on advancing transgender and racial justice.

The first global report of its kind, the TD SYNNEX Global Technology Ecosystem Benchmark Report follows regional industry benchmark studies in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan, and Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe report reflects TD SYNNEX\u2019s role at the center of a global ecosystem connecting technology producers, resellers, service providers, systems integrators, industry specialists and end-users.\n\u201cAs a leading IT ecosystem distributor and solutions aggregator, we have an opportunity and responsibility to help our channel partners identify industry trends as they navigate relentless transformation and plan for strategic growth,\u201d said TD SYNNEX Chief Strategy Officer Sergio Farache. \u201cThe Global Ecosystem Benchmark Report is an important milestone in defining and understanding what\u2019s happening in this globally connected IT ecosystem.\u201d\nBuilding on the\u00a0North American,\u00a0European,\u00a0Latin American and Caribbean\u00a0and\u00a0Asia Pacific and Japan\u00a0regional benchmark studies, the Global Insights Report focuses on three fundamental factors for technology ecosystem businesses:\nThe survey covered a range of topics from growth strategies and business challenges to customer needs and strategic investments, revealing five critical insights:\nInsight 1: Globally, technology resellers\u2019 strategic growth plans prioritize entering new vertical markets. Additionally, increased ecosystem partnerships are likely to be integral in executing on this growth strategy.\nRegulated verticals like financial services, government, education, healthcare and ESG are all expected to increase in importance over three years. Gaining the experience in these categories and delivering the technology solutions requires expertise that\u2019s hard to scale, which means partnerships can close functional gaps to deliver desired outcomes.\nInsight 2: Resellers are putting their investments in people to drive the outcomes customers want most.\nThe largest categories of reseller business investments are directly linked to acquiring skills, certification, and expertise. More than three-quarters of resellers globally are prioritizing budgets to increase knowledge in technical and business solutions areas customers frequently request, including Managed Services, Security Networking, Professional Services, Servers + Storage, and Hybrid Cloud, among others.\nInsight 3: Resellers are shifting resources to expand their cloud portfolios.\nWhen viewed as a single category, cloud solutions (cloud deployment, cloud integration, multi-cloud management, and others) eclipse all other technology solutions resellers conveyed that they plan to offer in the next 24 months, according to the Global Benchmark Report. Other top responses have a clear tie to cloud priorities (device as a service, digital transformation, IoT, security) making cloud solutions fundamental to global resellers\u2019 portfolio of offering.\nInsight 4: Global resellers are consumed by As-a-Service.\nThe near total adoption of As-a-Service consumption models resellers plan over the next two years is a short leap in logic from reseller\u2019s responsiveness to customers\u2019 technology solutions needs and the intended expansion of cloud offerings. Customers have always indicated they want flexibility when it comes to payment terms. The trend toward OpEx and consumption-based IT means a larger portion of resellers\u2019 business is likely to come from recurring revenue.\nInsight 5: ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and the AR/VR market are potential missed opportunities for resellers.\nIn contrast to the emphasis on skills acquisition, portfolio expansion and efforts to enter new vertical markets, sustainability and emerging technology are low on the priority list for solution development and business investment.\nIn different capacities, ESG and AR/VR solutions are both opportunities for global resellers.\nEffective ESG programs allow organizations to respond to partner and customer questions about sustainable practices and diversity, as well as comply with supplier codes of conduct, while some analysts forecast an AR/VR market opportunity of $800 billion by 2024, where 50% of that revenue is associated to technology platforms and hardware.\nThe full TD SYNNEX Global IT Ecosystem Benchmark Report, including an executive summary, is\u00a0available for download.\nSurvey Methodology\nIn partnership with Canalys, TD SYNNEX surveyed approximately 300 mid-size technology ecosystem partners across North and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific countries. Mid-size technology ecosystem partner is defined as 1,000 seats and below. Fieldwork for the Global Insights Report was conducted between July and October 2022.\nAbout TD SYNNEX\nTD SYNNEX (NYSE: SNX) is a leading global distributor and solutions aggregator for the IT ecosystem.

Financial results adjusted for constant currency are calculated by translating current period activity using the comparable prior year periods\u2019 currency conversion rate. TD SYNNEX uses non-GAAP gross billings, which adjusts revenues to exclude costs related to sales of third-party supplier service contracts, software as a service arrangements and certain fulfillment contracts. Non-GAAP gross billings are a useful non-GAAP metric in understanding the volume of our business activity and serve as an important performance metric in internally managing our operations. TD SYNNEX uses non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin which exclude purchase accounting adjustments. TD SYNNEX also uses adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, the amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments, legal settlements and other litigation, net, the related tax effects thereon and an income tax capital loss carryback benefit. Further, the Company uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) which excludes other income (expense), net, acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, share-based compensation expense and purchase accounting adjustments. In prior periods, TD SYNNEX has excluded other items relevant to those periods for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures.\nAcquisition, integration and restructuring costs, which are expensed as incurred, primarily represent professional services costs for legal, banking, consulting and advisory services, severance and other personnel-related costs, share-based compensation expense and debt extinguishment fees that are incurred in connection with acquisition, integration, restructuring, and divestiture activities. From time to time, this category may also include transaction-related gains/losses on divestitures/spin-off of businesses, costs related to long-lived assets including impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization expense due to changes in asset useful lives, as well as various other costs associated with the acquisition or divestiture.\nTD SYNNEX\u2019s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of finite-lived intangible assets which consist primarily of customer relationships and vendor lists. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company\u2019s Statements of Operations. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company\u2019s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the sale of the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company\u2019s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business nor reflect the Company\u2019s underlying business performance, enhances the Company\u2019s and investors\u2019 ability to compare the Company\u2019s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company\u2019s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\nShare-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of equity awards to employees and non-employee members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors based on the estimated fair value of those awards. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees, the fair value of the share-based awards may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards and the expense can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Given the variety and timing of awards and the subjective assumptions that are necessary when calculating share-based compensation expense, TD SYNNEX believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results from period to period.\nPurchase accounting adjustments are primarily related to the impact of recognizing the acquired vendor and customer liabilities related to the merger with Tech Data at fair value. These adjustments benefited our non-GAAP operating income through the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 based on historical settlement patterns with our vendors and in accordance with the timing defined in our policy for releasing vendor and customer liabilities we deem remote to be paid.\nLegal settlements and other litigation, net includes a benefit recorded in other income (expense), net during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 resulting from a decrease in our accrual for a legal matter in France.\nIn connection with the merger with Tech Data, the Company restructured its foreign financing structure, as well as select legal entities in anticipation of legally integrating legacy Tech Data and SYNNEX foreign operations. In addition to the treasury efficiencies, these restructurings resulted in a one-time domestic capital loss which would offset certain domestic capital gains when carried back under United States tax law, resulting in an income tax capital loss carryback benefit.\nTrailing fiscal four quarters ROIC is defined as the last four quarters\u2019 tax effected operating income divided by the average of the last five quarterly balances of borrowings and equity, net of cash. Adjusted ROIC is calculated by excluding the tax effected impact of non-GAAP adjustments from operating income and by excluding the cumulative tax effected impact of current and prior period non-GAAP adjustments on equity.\nTD SYNNEX also uses free cash flow, which is cash flow from operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. TD SYNNEX uses free cash flow to conduct and evaluate its business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, TD SYNNEX believes it is an additional useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing TD SYNNEX\u2019s liquidity that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations as it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, TD SYNNEX believes it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to its entire Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTD SYNNEX management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business, to establish operational goals, and in some cases for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide investors with an understanding of TD SYNNEX\u2019s operational results and trends that more readily enable investors to analyze TD SYNNEX\u2019s base financial and operating performance and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of operational trends, as well as for planning and forecasting in future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with TD SYNNEX\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of TD SYNNEX\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP financial information is set forth in the supplemental tables at the end of this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nStatements in this news release regarding TD SYNNEX that are not historical facts are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: TD SYNNEX Corp. SNX, Alamo Group Inc. ALG, Lennar Corp. LEN, Immersion Corp. IMMR and Bank OZK OZK.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n5 Stocks in Focus on Their Recent Dividend Hike\nU.S. stock markets have retreated in January after a sharp rally in 2023. The euphoria surrounding technology stocks evaporated as the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note returned northward, trading above 4%.\nThis was primarily owing to the uncertainty regarding the time when the Fed would initiate the first cut in the benchmark interest rate. Recently, a few key Fed FOMC members said that although they believe that the rate hike regime is over, they are yet to be convinced that the economic condition is conducive enough for an immediate rate cut.\nThe Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 rose 0.3% month-over-month in December, beating the consensus estimate of 0.2%. In November, CPI rose 0.1% month over month. CPI was up 3.4% in 2023 compared with the consensus estimate of 3.2%. However, in 2022, the inflation gauge was up around 6.4%.\nCore CPI (excluding the volatile food and energy items) increased 0.3% in December, in line with the consensus estimate and the metric for November. Year over year, core CPI was up 3.9% in December, beating the consensus estimate of 3.8%. However, the year-over-year core CPI reading in December was the lowest since May 2021.\nThis triggered an alarm among market participants and resulted in volatile trading at the beginning of 2024. At present, the CME FedWatch tool is showing 73% probability that the central bank will initiate a 25-basis point rate cut in its March FOMC meeting. Last week, the probability of the first rate cut was more than 90%.\nStocks to Watch\nAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments.Five such companies are \u2014 TD SYNNEX Corp., Alamo Group Inc., Lennar Corp., Immersion Corp. and Bank OZK.\nTD SYNNEX has been benefiting from the growing hybrid working trend, which is driving demand for offsite-working and learning hardware and software. Strong growth in product areas, such as networking and cloud and software-related solutions, is contributing to revenue acceleration at SNX\u2019s technology solutions business.\nA steady IT spending environment on the back of rapid digital transformation is a positive. Acquisitions and partnerships are helping SNX expand its product portfolio. SNX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOn Jan 9, 2024, TD SYNNEX declared that its shareholders would receive a dividend of $0.40 per share on Jan 26, 2024.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our earnings press release and the related Form 8-K available on our Investor Relations website, ir.tdsynnex.com. This conference call is the property of TD SYNNEX and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without our permission.\nI will now turn the call over to Rich. Rich?\nRich Hume\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nWe delivered solid fourth quarter results, with the gross billings at the high end of our outlook range and a significant EPS beat enabled by the continued execution of our business plan despite dynamic market conditions. Our strategic emphasis on high-growth technology areas, coupled with our broad technology portfolio, allowed us to pivot to margin-accretive areas of growth, and we saw signs of stabilization with healthy sequential improvement in revenue and gross billings in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full fiscal year, we successfully navigated the business environment, growing our market share in both Americas and Europe, increasing our business mix of high-growth technologies and expanding our non-GAAP operating margin to 2.85% through a combination of mix shift and full execution of merger synergies.\nOur business model, improved working capital management and the healthier supply chain conditions enabled us to generate robust free cash flow of $1.3 billion, ahead of our original $1 billion target.\nFrom this, we returned over $750 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing approximately 60% of our free cash flow for the year. This exceeded our 50% target as we opportunistically increased our share repurchases. In total, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares, or 7% of shares outstanding.\nAs Marshall will further discuss, we are also increasing our quarterly dividend in Q1 to $0.40 per share, or a 14% increase compared to the prior quarter. Balanced capital allocation and returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority for the company as we execute our strategy and drive value for our shareholders.\nMoving on to our fiscal fourth quarter results. From a gross billings perspective, the quarter played out at the high end of our expectations, with improving year-over-year declines in Endpoint Solutions. As expected, Advanced Solutions declined slightly on a year-over-year basis given the strong performance in FY '22 enabled by record backlog levels.\nFrom a regional perspective, the market environment in the Americas continued to show signs of stabilization, with improving year-over-year declines in Endpoint Solutions. Europe performed better than expected and improved sequentially despite a muted macroeconomic environment. In APJ, we continue to see traction in our portfolio build-out, helping to offset some of the softness in endpoint demand.\nWe made excellent progress on our strategic efforts to strengthen our end-to-end portfolio via new vendor additions, including Workday and Meta, where we are the exclusive North American distributor for their new suite of business products. We also expanded our security portfolio in Europe, one of our key priorities, with the addition of Palo Alto Networks' full range of cyber security, hardware and software products to our offerings in the region.\nOur strong pipeline of new vendors is bolstering our best-in-class portfolio of over 2,500 vendors, something which is becoming even more important as IT solutions are increasingly comprised of bundled multivendor offerings. As part of our focus on solutions aggregation, during the quarter, we launched our ISV acceleration program in North America, which is designed to help independent software vendors of all sizes to grow their businesses by accessing our extensive ecosystem, technical expertise, marketing and sales resources.\nWe were also honored to be recognized by several vendors with a variety of awards spanning the globe, including being named the global and North American Distribution Partner of the Year by Palo Alto Networks. We are proud of these distinctions and strive to continue elevating our offerings to help our partners grow their businesses.\nOur ESG goals and initiatives remained front and center during the fiscal year, and we recently achieved our second consecutive top score in the Corporate Equality Index, a leading benchmark survey and report measuring corporate policies related to LGBTQ plus workplace equality.\nIn addition, we formalized our commitment to disability inclusion at the company through my signing of Disability:IN CEO Letter. We're looking forward to sharing additional insights regarding our ESG initiatives in progress in our second Corporate Citizenship Report, which we will plan to publish in the first half of the year.\nAs we begin our new fiscal year, I wanted to provide a bit more color regarding our recently announced executive changes for the organization. Last week, Patrick Zammit assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer for TD SYNNEX. As COO, Patrick continues to report to me and takes on the responsibility for leading our day-to-day distribution operations, executing our business strategy to further drive profitable growth across the company and accelerating our penetration in strategic technologies.\nThis will also benefit us further by allowing me to focus on leading our strategic initiatives, identifying additional growth opportunities and focusing on relationships with key external stakeholders including vendors, partners and shareholders.\nI'd also like to take a moment to thank Michael Urban, President, Americas, who has decided to leave the company effective March 1 for his efforts in bringing TD SYNNEX together over the past two years. He and his team delivered a very successful merger integration in the Americas, and we wish him well in his next career chapter.\nFrom a regional perspective, we are in a strong position with the continued leadership of Peter Larocque in North America, Otavio Lazarini in Latin America and Jaideep Malhotra in APJ, all long-time industry veterans, and we look forward to announcing our next European leader in the very near future. With this highly skilled and experienced team, we entered 2024 well positioned to capitalize on the gradually improving IT spending market dynamics.\nLooking forward on our outlook for fiscal 2024, we are optimistic that the market headwinds we have experienced over the past several quarters will continue to abate as the year progresses. Early indications are that the gradual recovery in Endpoint Solutions will build throughout the year, fueled by the resumption of more normalized PC buying patterns. This will be balanced by tougher year-on-year compares for Advanced Solutions given the strong growth in the first half of 2023, but should position us well for returning to overall growth as we move through the year. Marshall will elaborate on this later.\nAs we think about our strategic priorities for FY '24, a couple of areas of importance I want to touch on are our digital platform capability and advancements in AI. As software and services continue to represent a greater portion of the overall IT spending for the industry, we remain focused on augmenting our capabilities in these areas to help customers assemble the critical solutions that their end users require.\nTo do this, we will continue investing in and building out our digital platform capabilities with the aim to provide customers with a one-stop-shop where they can easily access unified multi-vendor offerings.\nAI is another clear growth vector as we continue to look ahead in our industry. We have invested for several years in this space via our data analytics practice. This created the foundation for our AI strategy, and our decade-plus of experience in data analytics puts us in a leadership position relative to this new exciting market opportunity.\nWe have built a state-of-the-art vendor portfolio, starting with leading providers in the on-prem and off-prem infrastructure area required to run and train AI models. Many of our leading software vendors have announced or released embedded AI capabilities in their product lines, and we are working with industry leaders for AI foundational models to accelerate the development of use cases across our ecosystem.\nIn addition, we will leverage our strong relationships with PC OEMs to support and enable the introduction and growth of AI-enabled PCs over time as well as our relationships with key component suppliers and customers.\nIn addition to our previously announced Destination AI program, we are partnering with others in the ecosystem, such as our collaboration with Microsoft, where we launched a global AI-enabled journey for Microsoft 365 copilot last month. We are also working with several other strategic vendors to capitalize on our Destination AI framework to accelerate the adoption and use of new AI product set.\nIn closing, we believe we have the right strategy and are well equipped to continue navigating the ever-changing IT landscape while positioning ourselves to capitalize on new and emerging growth opportunities. We are committed to continuing to create shareholder value with a keen focus on execution and healthy capital returns.\nLastly, I want to take a moment to extend my sincere thanks to our customers and vendors who we are privileged to help achieve great outcomes with technology every day and to our 23,000 coworkers around the world who enable this important work.\nI will now turn the call over to Marshall so that he can provide additional details on our financial performance and outlook. Marshall?\nMarshall Witt\nThanks, Rich, and good morning to everyone on today's call.\nOur fiscal '23 full year results illustrate the power of our business model, broad technology portfolio and the progress we've made in positioning ourselves as a leader in the high-growth technologies of cloud, security, data analytics and AI.\nDespite a challenging market environment due to industry-wide reductions in demand for PC ecosystem products, we demonstrated continued strength across Advanced Solutions and high-growth technologies and grew both our gross and operating margins for the full year. The resiliency of our business model helped offset some of the pressure from the reduced revenue, and our businesses responded appropriately by acting to align our cost to the changes in volume and mix. This enabled significant free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders.\nMoving to our fiscal fourth quarter performance. As Rich mentioned, we had strong gross billings in Q4, and importantly, saw early signs of stabilization in IT spending with lesser year-on-year declines in Endpoint Solutions. Advanced Solutions faced tougher compares given the strong performance last year, when backlog levels were still elevated.\nFiscal Q4 total gross billings were $19.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, and at the high end of our outlook range, driven by stabilization in the Americas and outperformance in Europe. Net revenue was $14.4 billion, down 11% year-over-year and near the midpoint of our outlook range. Gross to net revenue adjustments were larger than expected due to a shift in business mix and the migration of a Hyve customer to a consignment model.\nAs a reminder, this migration is due to certain components transitioning to a customer-owned procurement model. While this has a negative impact to our net revenue, it does not materially impact operating profit. For the fiscal fourth quarter, this change impacted net revenue negatively by $270 million.\nNon-GAAP gross profit was $1.02 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin was 7.07%, up 44 basis points year-over-year, as we continue to see the positive effects of a richer product mix and our progress in expanding high-growth technologies, which continue to represent more than 20% of total gross billings for both the quarter and the full year.\nTotal adjusted SG&A expense was $592 million, up $10 million year-over-year and up $15 million quarter-over-quarter, which was expected given the sequential growth in gross billings of $1 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $427 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 3%. Non-GAAP interest expense and finance charges were $66 million, $4 million better than our outlook and approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 22%, better than our forecasted 24%, primarily due to the mix of our business within certain regions.\nTotal non-GAAP net income was $286 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.13, $0.23 above the high end of our guidance range, due to a combination of better-than-expected performance on gross billings, profitability, interest expense and taxes, as well as higher share repurchases. As a reminder, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22 was $3.44, but the year-over-year comparison for EPS is impacted by $0.33 of high-margin recoveries in fiscal fourth quarter of '22.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 2.3x, and net leverage was 1.7x, in line with our investment-grade credit rating and approaching our target of 2x gross leverage ratio. Accounts receivable totaled $10.3 billion, up from $8.9 billion in the prior quarter. And inventories totaled $7.1 billion, down from $7.5 billion in the prior quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, net working capital was $3.3 billion, and the cash conversion cycle was 23 days, both flat from Q3. Cash from operations in the quarter was $211 million, and free cash flow was $168 million. In total, we generated approximately $1.3 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '23, ahead of the $1 billion target we guided to at the beginning of fiscal '23.\nWe returned $374 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $343 million via share repurchases and $31 million through dividend payments. For the full fiscal year, we returned $751 million to shareholders, of which $621 million was through share repurchases, compared to $125 million in fiscal '22.\nWe currently have approximately $396 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. For the current quarter, our Board of Directors has approved a 14% increase to our cash dividend and $0.40 per common share, which will be payable on January 26, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 19, 2024.\nMoving now to our outlook for fiscal first quarter. We expect gross billings of $19 billion to $20 billion, representing a decline of 3% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $14 billion to $14.7 billion, representing a decline of 5% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint. Our guidance is based on a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.09.\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $232 million to $277 million. And non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $3.10 per diluted share, based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 88.4 million. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $66 million, and we expect non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 23%.\nAdditionally, I wanted to highlight that effective next quarter, we will begin providing some additional disclosures to enhance our reporting to investors and other stakeholders. Starting in fiscal Q1, we will provide more clarity regarding our gross billings, net revenue and gross profit for Edge Solutions and Advance Solutions.\nEdge Solutions, which we previously referred to as Endpoint Solutions, will include PCs, peripherals, mobile, print, and other devices, including AR/VR. Advanced Solutions will include hyperscale infrastructure, cloud, servers, networking, storage and software. Our reportable segments will continue to be based on geographies of Americas, Europe and APJ.\nAs we think about the full fiscal year for 2024, we currently expect non-GAAP gross billings to be approximately flat year-over-year in the first half of the fiscal year, with expected growth of mid- to high-single-digits in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion in free cash flow for the fiscal year and remain committed to our medium-term capital allocation target returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via both dividends and share repurchases while remaining opportunistic depending on market conditions.\nIn closing, we successfully navigated the volatile market conditions in fiscal '23 and are well positioned to capitalize on a return to growth in fiscal '24 with a focus on margin expansion, robust free cash flow generation and a commitment to continued healthy shareholder returns.\nWith that, we are now ready to take your questions. Operator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open.\nDavid Vogt\nGreat. Thanks guys for taking the question. So maybe just a question for both of you. In terms of how you're thinking about fiscal '24, we appreciate the color on sort of the gross billings commentary for the first half and the second half. Can you kind of help us understand a little bit more how you're thinking about maybe at a higher level, sort of what's underpinning that spending pattern from an IT spending backdrop? Whether you want to talk about it from an Edge Solutions perspective, a new category or Advanced Solutions, can you kind of help us think about how you're thinking about the broader market and your position and your ability to kind of grow faster than the market? I would assume it's kind of embedded in your outlook. So maybe we'll just start there, if that's okay. Thanks.\nRich Hume\nDavid, good morning, and thanks for the question. This is Rich. Yes. If you think about the evolution on -- throughout -- and then the back end of COVID, obviously, last year at about this time, the PC ecosystem set of products really went into a pretty significant decline. At the same time, back into COVID, there was pent-up demand and backlog for Advanced Solutions products.\nSo as we come into this fiscal, you have an easier compare within the PC ecosystem. You have a more difficult compare in the Advanced Solutions because of the cycles that had transpired in the past. So our point of view is when we think about the first half, that there will be some level of growth in PC ecosystem, but the Advanced Solutions will face a bit of a more challenging compare. Then when we get to the back half of the year, we believe that most of the wraps, if you will, have concluded and that both of those major segments will have growth attributes. And that's what has led us to the guide of kind of flattish in the first half with mid-, high-single-digit in the second half.\nAnd yes, of course, it's always our intention to do better than the market. In fact, in the prepared remarks, we talked about in the Americas theater as well as -- I'm sorry, the North America theater as well as the European theater that we had gained some market share. So Marshall, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nMarshall Witt\nYes, David, just some more color. When we do our assessment for quarter one and for the full fiscal '24, we come at it from a bottoms-up perspective. So think about it for all the countries that we do business in, each one of those leaders looked at what that is for their territory. So there's a country assessment.\nAnd within that, there's certainly a vendor and a customer comparison as well as, call it third-party industry data, just to triangulate where we should land. And then with that, as Richard said, we certainly look at the GDP, the overall trajectory of what that looks like by market what IT spend correlation is expected to be relative to GDP and then our ability to outgrow that.\nDavid Vogt\nAnd can I just ask a follow-up? In the prepared remarks, you talked extensively about AI and obviously, that being a contributor to the business. How should we think about AI across the business, let's say, over the next year or 2? And how is that factored into your outlook this year, I guess? I mean, I would imagine -- there's a lot of discussion by chip makers, OEMs, et cetera, that, let's say, on the endpoint or edge solution market. You'll see stuff at the latter half of, I guess, 2024, calendar '24, I should say. I just would love to kind of get your thoughts on how you think that kind of shapes through the year from an AI perspective.\nRich Hume\nYes. So David, I would use cloud as a parallel or an analogy here. So obviously, there was a lot of marketing and fanfare, call it the Hyve -- or I think the IDC calls at the Hyve curve at the front end, where clearly, this is a real technology that's going to bring a lot of benefits, but the plans are defined and there's a bit of a gap until the reality starts to flow through the market. From an AI perspective, there will be a lot of AI embedded in existing offerings.\nSo I'm sure there's going to be a fairly comprehensive discussion on how to count AI as there was cloud back in the day. Certainly, there will be the emergence of new AI capabilities. What comes to mind is AI servers, et cetera. So right now, certainly, there are products in market that are AI-enabled. As we move through time, there'll be more and more and more. We have incorporated the thoughts of AI into our forecast for the full year.\nBut as you had indicated, it's more of an early ramp, with the expectation that there will be more robust demand as we move through time.\nNow the only other thing that I would tell you is that I believe is the reality is that this isn't just an incremental on top on whatever IT spending might have been planned prior to AI. Every company sort of lives within an envelope. They decide with that budgeted envelope bid, and there might be some expansion, but this won't be just a new market segment that provides a complete on-top increment, but rather, there will be some reprioritization that happens relative to how customers spend their IT dollars moving forward. So yes, I think it will have a positive effect on IT growth, but again, it won't be a complete increment.\nDavid Vogt\nGreat, that's helpful, Rich. Thanks guys.\nOperator\nWe will take our next question from Vince Colicchio with Barrington Research. Your line is open.\nVince Colicchio\nYes, Rich, curious how you think your share position performed in all your geographies this quarter?\nRich Hume\nYes. As we had reported in the past, when we think about share, we have really good insight relative to North America and Europe, but we really don't have visibility yet. There is a service that is emerging in Europe. As it relates to the quarter, our information would say we lost a couple of tenths of market share, tenths of 1%, if you will, on the aggregated basis, while having grown share for the full year.\nVince Colicchio\nAnd then could you provide a bit more color on what gives you confidence in the continued improvement of Endpoint Solutions throughout the year?\nRich Hume\nYes. So as Marshall talked about the very comprehensive process that we go through, our indicators in talking to customers, vendors, working with our own teams are that we will see growth moving forward in Endpoint. And in fact, within our Q1 guide, we anticipate some growth within the Endpoint. So we feel good about that. While we have a moderating situation in Advanced Solutions based on the commentary that I provided earlier.\nVince Colicchio\nWhen you talk about growth in Endpoint, you're talking about sequential, I suppose?\nRich Hume\nNo, year-on-year.\nVince Colicchio\nOh, really? That's good to hear. Thank you.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My congrats to Patrick on the new role. And thanks for giving guidance on billings. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the impact of this mix shift to more netted down items? Specifically, what year-on-year impact to revenues and margins is embedded in your fiscal 1Q guidance? And if you can talk about how we should think about this for fiscal year '24. So as this shift happens, should we expect this difference between gross billings and revenue to continue to expand throughout the year?\nMarshall Witt\nThanks for the question, Ruplu. So for Q1, we gave a guidance of gross billings, I think, around 3% down on net around 5. So Ruplu, if you think about the overall gross versus net momentum, if you -- I want to call it that. We were around 22% to 23% of netted down revenue in fiscal '22. That has gone now to 25% to 26% in '23. I would anticipate that we'll probably continue into '24. It's hard to call that beyond the first quarter in terms of relationships.\nBut for us, the mix shift is a reflection of how AS has played against ES, I would say that as we think about next year and the increased expected performance of AS, there may be a shift or a stabilization of that gross versus net, maybe it sticks around 26%. It's quite possible, just given what we're seeing behavior-wise. Our thoughts in terms of forecast is as we get into the year, there could be a more balanced growth rates for both ES and AS. Whereas in the past, there's been kind of a predominant ES growth, and then that takes a backseat, and AS comes in and takes the front seat.\nSo I would use a 25% to 26% adjustment for '24. And then as we plot along, we'll inform you as to the behavior, what that looks like. One thing just to call out that was in the prepared remarks was the consignment program for Hyve. That had about a $270 million impact on net revenue, no impact on profit. We're expecting that to be about $250 million per quarter. That all expects the continuing in volume related to this consignment program with this Hyve customer.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay, Marshall. Thanks for all the details there. Just for my follow-up, if I can ask, you guided free cash flow to $1.2 billion. And you maintained the shareholder return of 50% returns and 50% reinvestment in the business. So when we think about that reinvestment, 50%, how are you thinking about organic investments versus M&A, now that your integration with the two large companies is now more or less complete in North America? So is it now tying for further M&A? So any thoughts there?\nRich Hume\nRuplu, good morning, thank you for the question. This is Rich. So when we talk about our capital allocation strategy, as you know, it's 50% and 50% over the continuum. There could be periods where we're heavier weighted one way or the other. Obviously, Marshall talked about FY '23 in his prepared remarks, and we were, I think, at 60%-ish for return to shareholder in total.\nSo as we kind of plot through the year, certainly, we have a pipeline of acquisition targets that we continue to look at and work. Those deals have to have a willing recipient on the other end, and they've got to work for us. And usually, we take a look at those acquisition targets and really want to make sure that they complement our strategy. So going forward, I would tell you that the 50-50 is sort of a good way to think about it. And again, things don't always go exactly as planned. So we adjust course as required based on the circumstance. So Marshall, anything you have to add?\nMarshall Witt\nYes, Ruplu, just one other thing to call out. If you think about our quarter one spot. There is a little bit incremental SG&A related to, I'll call it, reinvestment or continued investment. Specifically in AS. As AS softens, we're not going to soften our investment. So there could be a little bit of a heavier SG&A in the front half of '24. So I just wanted to let you know that it may appear as if there's an imbalance in that relationship of E to R on a gross billing basis, but it's very well thought out. As we believe as we get into the second half, AS has an opportunity -- forecasted opportunity to recover.\nRuplu Bhattacharya\nOkay, thank you for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nAnd we will take our next question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Ng\nHi, good morning. Thank you very much for the questions. Marshall, maybe just a follow-up on the SG&A point that you just made. Is 2.75% to 3.25% of billings still the right way to think about that? And maybe you could just help us think about how SG&A evolves throughout the year? And then I just have a quick follow-up.\nMarshall Witt\nSure. You're right, Mike. It's that range of 2.75% to 3.25% in relation to gross billings. We'll start right around 3% in quarter one, and the expectation has been that structure should help build out the growth in the portfolio and should, we'll call it ratably or incrementally come down to something below 3%.\nIf I think about a couple of relationships, one is the year-over-year on SG&A for quarter one. There's two things. One was the AS investment. The other thing, although it's somewhat subtle, this time last year, we had already started to see the decline in the performance and started to step down some of our provisions around variable pay. This year, the good news is we're assuming we're going to hit our number and grow it.\nSo there's a little bit of heavier bonus and variable pay associated with quarter one. The other thing is the actual FX itself from a euro perspective is up. So that's about $10 million to $15 million of headwind on that. And then finally, the SG&A investment that we've stated on -- on AS is another investment that we believe is important to be made. So we feel that we're in a strong position. We think that the 3% is probably going to be the top end for fiscal '24, and we should see that improve as we play it out quarter by quarter.\nMichael Ng\nGreat. Thank you. That's very clear, Marshall. And it was encouraging to hear about the new segment disclosures by product around billings, revenue and I think you said gross profit as well. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a preview of some of the potential revelations that we may have as you give out those new disclosures. Does the narrative kind of tighten up around the growth and margin outlook for those segments in the near midterm?\nMarshall Witt\nYes, Mike, I think for -- as a general response to that, Rich and I have spoken to the margin attributes of AS and ES. We've spoken about the growth attributes. But it just allows us to be more specific. So I do think that the revelations and the -- the clarity that we can speak to the actual performance within the portfolio, I think, just helps drive better understanding of the mix, the profit margins or the gross margin of the business, right? We believe it is an enhancer. We think it is a value contributor. And we do think it will help inform the actual performance for the quarter and what our thoughts are for the upcoming quarter.\nRich Hume\nYes. Just to add to that, I think generally, my point of view is the narrative that we provide in the call is -- is fairly directionally correct relative to what I think you'll see in the segmentation going forward. We always talk about the segments, and you all ask for insights around the segment. But this will put sort of the definitive clarity out there in print.\nAnd then the second point that I would make, Michael, is that you guys are pretty good at modeling. Every time we get an insight relative to models, we are impressed relative to how you guys think about the business and how you laid out.\nMichael Ng\nGreat. Well, thank you for the incremental transparency. I appreciate it, Rich and Marshall.\nOperator\nAnd we will take our next question from [Alek Valero ] with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi guys. Subbing in for [indiscernible] today. Thank you for taking my question. So my question is, do you guys believe that Hyve can become involved in gen AI server builds? We've heard from our work that they may be?\nRich Hume\nI'm sorry, can you repeat that? You broke up a little bit.\nUnidentified Analyst\nFor sure. My question was, do you guys believe that Hyve can become involved in gen AI server builds?\nRich Hume\nYes. If the question is do we believe Hyve will participate in AI server builds, absolutely. Remember that the big segment of Hyve is an ODM type of business. And so we end up building what our customers have interest in. And certainly, we have full expectation that we will be participating in the AI builds moving forward.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAwesome, awesome. So as a quick follow-up, what are -- what key spending areas were softer than you may have anticipated? Or softer than typical seasonality? And maybe if you can touch on what you expect from PC seasonality in February and May quarters?\nRich Hume\nYes, I may. As it relates to Q4 in the prepared remarks -- and this is -- I guess, the pleasant surprise is, for the most part, the sales were consistent with our expectations. I think Marshall talked a little bit about maybe some -- a little bit better strength in Europe versus our expectation, but it wasn't overwhelmingly different.\nAnd then for each of the segments, they sort of came in fairly consistent with our expectation. As we move ahead, as we had talked about, because of the backlog runoff last year in AS, we would anticipate a more challenging compare year-on-year. And then as we sort of move through the year, that compare sort of through time gets a little bit easier as the backlog had dissipated, if you will, through the year. And so that would be our expectation. But again, our crystal ball would say that both of those segments are growing in the second half of next year, both the Endpoint as well as the Advanced segment.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAwesome. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\nOperator\nAnd we will take our next question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle\nOkay. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask on trends and profit dollars for the business overall. And just observing that you finished fiscal '23 with non-GAAP net income just down, I think, over 8%, you executed on synergies during the year. So ex that, I would think non-GAAP net income down double digits. And if I look at the midpoint for Q1, based on your guidance, it looks like net income is going to be down close to 10%.\nAnd it looks like you've got some cost optimization that may be helping a little bit in the first half of the year. So probably north of 10%, ex that. So for investors that are seeing these double-digit net income declines, maybe you could touch on the drivers that are causing that trend and whether you think that's just kind of a structural aspect of the business at this point, and we're working on just optimization on that? Or is there a stake in the ground that you want to put on timing to return that to growth?\nMarshall Witt\nAdam, this is Marshall. I'll start. So I'll take it first on just the overall revenue attributes and the comment we made about our expectation on ES showing positive growth attributes in quarter one. So with that comes a margin profile -- gross margin profile that is somewhat lower than the AS margin profile. We think that's probably about 20 bps. And just in terms of the mix, we think that that plays out for quarter one.\nAnd then just if I touch on some of the cost attributes that I commented on earlier and thinking about quarter one. Quarter one last year was kind of the beginning point where we started to see the volumes of our business fall. We had identified that we had seen some mismatch -- inefficient mismatches in quarter two and three. So we took some additional cost reduction opportunities. We were able to kind of recoup that inflated cost back in by the time we got towards the end of this year.\nAnd now in terms of these net headwinds going into quarter one, as I said earlier, there is some overall expectation that we're going to be growing into a better performance throughout the year. So with that, we're kind of filling our variable expectations for pay versus last year. We had already started to take down those variable attributes given where we thought the business was going.\nAnd then again, as I said earlier, the AS investment, we're leaning into those. So there's a little bit higher cost associated with that, which is driving maybe some of the margin headwinds on that. So I think inflationary might be the last one where we are seeing a little bit of a longer tail on some of the inflationary areas around health care. But as you probably have seen in the past, we figure out ways to create productivities to offset that. It may take a couple of quarters to get there.\nSo I do think the compare itself is a little bit more difficult in quarter one from a margin profile perspective. But if I actually think about the margin attributes of AS and ES, our intentions are that we still believe we can grow both of those portfolio margin attributes over the course of the year. It's the mix itself and some of these SG&A elements that I think are causing some of the story to change a little bit.\nAdam Tindle\nGot it. Okay. So maybe just to follow up on that. You helped with the gross billings for the year, it's kind of flat first half, mid- to high-single-digits in the back half. Let's just call it mid-single-digit growth for the year in gross billings overall to keep it simple. Would -- given everything that you just mentioned there, would growth in non-GAAP net income be at a similar level of gross billings growth? And why or why not?\nMarshall Witt\nYes. I mean, roughly said, our expectation is that gross profit hopefully will be flat to up and non-GAAP op income will be flat to up. So again, that's the expectation. We'll have to see how it plays out as we -- as we expect that second half growth profile to be in that mid- to high-single-digit range.\nRich Hume\nYes. I think, Adam, just to maybe be a bit repetitive. The thing that we've got to work through is the mix shifts back now to more Endpoint. And as that happens, as Marshall said, there's probably a 20 basis point headwind that we need to work on and figure out how to improve upon. I would say that we're reasonably proud of the fact that when you take a look at the op income margin for FY '23, we've been able to hold that or we held that despite the revenue declines that we had faced.\nSo we have some work to do going forward, but we kind of have our eye on it, and the execution engine will kind of focus on how do we drive improvement moving forward.\nAdam Tindle\nOkay. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Rich. You talked a lot about Hyve consignment. But I think on the last call, it was -- you talked about a new customer ramp that you were expecting in fiscal '24. Could you give us maybe any update on that and visibility into the timing and magnitude of that? Thanks.\nRich Hume\nYes. So the customer ramp was just a little bit delayed due to timing of things, but we fully anticipate that we're clear to go moving forward.\nAdam Tindle\nOkay. And so do we -- do you have a sense of timing and magnitude on it yet?\nMarshall Witt\nTiming, we think the ramp should begin in quarter one and probably show itself a little bit more in quarter two. So at that point, hopefully, it will be meaningful enough for us to speak to.\nAdam Tindle\nOkay, thank you very much.\nRich Hume\nThank you, Adam.\nMarshall Witt\nThanks, Adam.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from George Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGeorge Wang\nHey, guys, Richard and Marshall, I just have a question just on the AIPCs. I just want to double-click just especially in terms of the time line and the kind of cadence for the ramp. Just curious if you have any more color to share, just kind of from your perspective? And also we heard a bunch from the OEM and the kind of chip makers. Just curious, kind of what specification you can disclose to better so they contribute to the AIPC wave, if you will?\nRich Hume\nYes. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Obviously, it's a new technology coming in. All indications that we have, it will be sort of at the high end of the premium price band going forward as one would anticipate or in the fiscal year coming, I should say. All of the intelligence that we have says that it will be sort of a single-digit percent of total of the entire PC population, and then, I think, becoming more meaningful in FY '25 and then into FY '26. So great opportunity going forward. Kind of best crystal ball estimate is sort of mid-single-digit back half of the year percent of total PC volume and then growing meaningfully after that.\nGeorge Wang\nOkay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks.\nRich Hume\nWell, thank you.\nOperator\nWe will take our next question from Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoseph Cardoso\nHi, good morning, and thanks for the question. Yes, just one for me. I just wanted to piggyback on some of the AS questions. First, can you just clarify if the year-over-year declines in AS were largely in line with your expectations 90 days ago? And then more specifically, can you just elaborate on the trends you're seeing across some of the product categories there like servers, networking as well as any others? And just curious if any of those are trending better or worse relative to your expectations.\nAnd then just the second part of that question, as you think about a recovery in the back half, is that broad-based across these product categories? Or are you thinking that it's more concentrated to a particular one? Thanks for the question, guys.\nRich Hume\nJoe, good morning, and thank you for the question. So what I -- the way I would talk about this is I think that the underlying demand across all of these technologies is pretty good. And lead with how to think about how these technologies emerged and have grown from my point of view is to think about when their backlogs recovered last year, because that's inevitably the increment of the compare year-on-year that I think sort of distorts the numbers a little bit. And when I come at it from that perspective, server and storage had recovered its backlog earlier. And then networking had carried the backlog later into last year.\nAnd so when I think about the recovery on a year-to-year basis, I think server and storage emerged earlier than networking because of that backlog hanging around for a longer period of time will be later in the cycle. As we had stated earlier then when we get to the back half of the year, we think that each of these categories should have growth attributes. That's at least our expectation.\nJoseph Cardoso\nNo, makes sense. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.\nRich Hume\nThanks, Joe.\nOperator\nAnd we will take our next question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum\nGood morning, guys. A question for you on like the revenue synergies that were anticipated from the ERP integrations. I guess are those proceeding as you guys expected? And how are you expecting those to ramp up throughout the rest of the year, is that baked into your guidance?\nRich Hume\nSo Keith, good morning. I hope everything is well. Yes, they're proceeding consistent with our expectations. We would anticipate as we think about this year that we're going to start to see meaningful progress relative to our cross-sell opportunities with our customers. When we think about our guide, we fundamentally believe that we've baked that opportunity into the guide and it will really kind of ramp up and hopefully be a bit more meaningful in the back half of the year. Do you have anything to add, Marshall?\nMarshall Witt\nNo.\nKeith Housum\nAppreciate it. And if I could just touch on real quick, the acquisition from -- you announced over the past week or two, I believe it was Cokeva, and please correct me if I get the name wrong. But it appears more of a life cycle services company. I guess, perhaps talk about the strategy and making that investment now, when I think your largest competitor actually got out of that business recently. Perhaps there's a strategy diversion and is that an opportunistic or competitive advantage you have versus your competitors?\nRich Hume\nSo first of all, let's talk about the primary capabilities that are offered with the acquisition. First is around repair and then test and refurbishment. We certainly participate in those businesses today. And really, we connect quite well relative to assisting our vendors in that regard. And we like the business.\nAnd obviously, it also offers a 220,000 square foot piece of real estate, which will allow us to do more integration for customers as well. But we see a good demand, a solid demand for those services with our vendors, and they've been encouraging us to grow that footprint, which we are doing. The other thing I'd like for you to think about is there's more focus on these types of things, especially the refurb segment moving forward as sustainability comes front and center. So we also see sort of, if you will, a bit of a revival around refurb as the world tries to become more sustainable. So we think that there's going to be an extra ticker relative to these types of businesses moving forward based on that focus.\nKeith Housum\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd we'll take our last question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra\nThanks for taking my question. There was a lot of discussion around AS dynamics near term, both the first half and the second half of '24. But as we get through some of that near-term volatility, I was wondering if you can talk about how should we think about the midterm growth for the AS solution as well as margin profile for this business over the midterm? Thanks.\nMarshall Witt\nYes. So I'll start, Rich, and you can chime in. So for AS, as we said in our prepared remarks, we still have some backlog from a comparative standpoint that will be -- make it a difficult comparison year-on-year as we're in quarter one. We think as we play out the rest of fiscal '24, we expect to see a return to growth for both portfolios, ES and AS. The -- we'll call it the sequential momentum of that or ratability of that is still somewhat to be determined.\nBut I do think back to the comments we made about how we build up our forecast, we do rely quite a bit on our leaders at the country level to look at their AS relationships and to figure out and determine how best we think that's going to grow. But thinking about that low- or mid-single-digit to high-single-digit growth rate, I would also think about AS as performing in that same range in the second half.\nAshish Sabadra\nMaybe just to clarify, like -- is that like the -- when we think about that exiting at mid- to high- single-digit growth for AS in '24, is that the right growth profile? Or could we see a further acceleration there over the next three years, let's say, midterm?\nMarshall Witt\nYes. So beyond the thoughts we gave, we don't provide guidance or thoughts around what it looks like in '25 and '26. Certainly, we go back to our strategic initiatives and how we position our investments and the commentary we made near term about what we're doing to lean into AS, SG&A and the skill sets and how important it is to retain those and grow those. So we're certainly confident in that market space. But beyond the commentary, not much more we can provide in terms of what that looks like.\nRich Hume\nYes. I guess the only thing that I would add to Marshall's comments is we always have an aspiration to grow a bit faster than the market. I think history would say that we had been successful relative to that pursuit. And we would kind of characterize '25 and '26 with that type of expectation that whatever the market growth is that we would aspire to and execute above -- a little bit above market expectations.\nAshish Sabadra\nThat's very helpful color. And maybe if I can ask a clarifying question. PC decline, obviously, was a big headwind in fiscal year '23. Have you quantified or is there a way to think about the total revenue headwinds from the PC decline in the fiscal year '23 last year?\nMarshall Witt\nSo a specific number, no. It clearly was in the PC ecosystem, a negative contributor to the overall decline in our revenue portfolio. So it did have a meaningful impact. If I sit back and think about ES and AS, something ES had its moment in '21 and halfway through '22 and AS had its moment in '22 and '23. So we're happy that we've got such a broad and diverse portfolio.\nAnd yes, we have certain attributes that behave differently from time to time. But the benefit of our large portfolio allows us to have a balanced view when certain aspects of ES are down and certain aspects of AS could be up. But the complementary line card, I think, is what really benefits us.\nRich Hume\nYes. Just a way of thinking about this is, last year, we knew AS had grown and ES had declined. Those are the two major segments of our business. So if you take a look at the net change in revenue year-on-year, you're probably getting close to the answer.\nAshish Sabadra\nThat's very helpful color. Thank you. Thanks again.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the call back to Mr. Rich Hume for closing remarks.\nRich Hume\nWell, thanks, everyone, and thanks for participating in the call today. FY '23 certainly played out different than we all had anticipated as we had sat around the table this time last year. That being said, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished. I'm very proud of our relationships with our vendors and our customers. They are our primary stakeholders, and my congratulations to our 23,000 coworkers around the world for doing a great job executing in this more challenging environment than anticipated.\nWith that, I wish you all a great day.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nAbout SNX Stock\nMore on SNX\nTrending Analysis\nTrending News"
