Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nGerman optics powerhouse Zeiss is set to unveil its Multifunctional Smart Glass technology at the upcoming CES 2024 in Las Vegas. The cutting-edge technology boasts the ability to project holographic and augmented-reality content on a transparent surface, opening doors to a myriad of applications, from automotive head-up displays to smart home innovations.\nThe thin polymer film at the core of the technology can turn any glass surface \u2013 be it the windows of buildings, transparent screens, or vehicle side windows \u2013 into an interactive and dynamic display, offering over 92 percent transparency.\nA Gutenberg moment\nAt the heart of Zeiss's Multifunctional Smart Glass technology is a thin, transparent layer equipped with ultra-high-precision optics. This layer, with transparency exceeding 92 percent, serves as the canvas for holographic projections and can turn any glass surface into an on-demand screen for communications with maximum clarity.\nZeiss\n\u201cThis technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing,\u201d said Roman Kleindienst, Vice President of Zeiss Microoptics, in a statement, describing the technology as the \u201cGutenberg moment\u201d for holography.\nThe replication technology introduced by Zeiss breaks the conventional constraints of small production runs, enabling the large-scale production of holograms for the first time. This technology has already found applications in space missions conducted by ESA and NASA, as well as in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors.\nBeyond the screen\nOne of the most intriguing applications of Zeiss's technology is the \"holocam,\" a transparent camera seamlessly integrated into glass panels. The holocam leverages coupling, decoupling, and light-guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor.\nThis technology eliminates the need for visible cutouts or installation space for cameras and sensors, introducing a sleek, unobtrusive design, and could find its place in parking sensors of cars and driver fatigue detection systems.\nAnother interesting application of the holocam would be videoconferencing where placing the holocam at the center of the screen would allow participants to make eye contact naturally, with the technology\u2019s brilliant transparency causing the slightest of effects on image reproduction.\nZeiss envisions its technology being utilized not only for entertainment purposes but also for environmental data collection, including monitoring air pollution and UV exposure.\nZeiss\nHolograms Everywhere\nBesides the transparent camera, Zeiss will also showcase augmented Reality Head-Up Displays (HUDs) for cars at CES 2024, offering drivers a seamless and safe interface for crucial information without diverting attention from the road.\nThe technology could extend beyond dashboard displays, transforming side and rear windows into platforms for Car2X communications, blacking out window glass, or showcasing projected text and images visible only from specific angles.\nBeyond the automotive sector, Zeiss sees potential in smart homes, where holographic 3D control elements can appear on flat surfaces, activated by gestures or voice commands. The transparent layer could also facilitate interior lighting innovations and energy generation through the absorption of sunlight, presenting new possibilities for power generation in office building facades and residential windows.\nZeiss is positioning itself as a system provider rather than a hardware producer and aims to offer OEMs the means to enhance their products with this groundbreaking technology."

This disruptive technology permits the optical activation of transparent media. It combines four basic functions \u2013 projection, detection, illumination and filtering to open up entirely new holographic possibilities, from smart home solutions through to augmented reality head-up displays with minimal installation space. ESA and NASA space missions have carried this trailblazing ZEISS technology on board for many years. It is also well established in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors. At the CES \u2013 Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall, W306 \u2013 ZEISS will present its industrial solutions with equipment and processes for mass production. With microoptical and holographic surfaces, they are suitable for everyday use: for more safety, interactivity, efficiency and comfort.\nReplication technology enables industrial-scale hologram production for the first time\nAt the heart of the ZEISS technology is a thin, transparent layer to which ultra-high-precision optics are attached in the smallest of spaces. It is characterized by transparency of over 92 percent combined with maximum clarity. It makes it possible for holographic technology to be used in applications where limitations of installation space, weight and costs previously stood in the way. The holographic functionality can turn any glass surface (windows of buildings, transparent screens, side windows of vehicles) into an on-demand screen for communications.\nIn the past, holograms were limited to small production runs. With the replication technology developed in the ZEISS laboratories, the fully automated duplication of a master hologram in large quantities is now possible for the first time. Roman Kleindienst, Vice President ZEISS Microoptics: \"This technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing. That's why we call it the 'Gutenberg moment' for holography.\"\nHolography in the car: clear benefits for safety and comfort\nAugmented Reality HUDs have many advantages in cars: Drivers obtain all of the input they need without taking their eyes off the road. The selected information that they want or need appears within their field of vision. Other benefits are the simple functionality and additional comfort: Holographic 3D content permits more design, branding, guidance and information functions. For example, side and rear windows can be used for eye-catching Car2X communications. It is also possible to black out window glass or make projected text and images visible only from the inside or outside. Video content is also supported. As a holographic lighting system \u2013 on brake lights of cars or two-wheeled vehicles \u2013 the ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology, with its 3D imaging, opens up new levels of design freedom for light signatures.\nFloating switches in vehicle cockpits or smart homes\nA remarkable example of the new design possibilities presented by ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass can be seen in floating switches. These are holographic, 3D human-machine interfaces based on the unique transparent layer from ZEISS. They allow 3D control elements to be displayed on demand as holographics \u2013 in other words, light projections \u2013 in the form of switches or controls on clean black-panel surfaces. They are activated by voice or gesture control only when needed. This gives a clean, contemporary look to vehicle interiors or the controls of smart household appliances.\nTransparent camera\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology permits the integration of a transparent camera \u2013 a \"holocam\" \u2013 that uses coupling, decoupling and light guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor. This eliminates the need for cutouts or installation space in visible areas for cameras or sensors in the exterior for following distance alerts or parking sensors or in the interior for fatigue detection systems.\nThe ZEISS technology also delivers significant added value for entertainment electronics products such as screens and displays that have integrated cameras. For example, the placement of the holocam at the center of the screen will allow participants in videoconferences to make eye contact. The transparency of the holographic layer has only a minimal effect on the brilliance of the image reproduction.\nIt is also possible to detect spectral components as additional information to complement the visible image. The resulting data provide insights into environmental contamination such as air pollution and UV exposure.\nInterior lighting plus energy generation\nOther applications of ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology can be found especially in the smart home. For example, innovative interior lighting can be realized through special holographic decoupling elements in exterior glass that is almost indistinguishable from natural light. Window panes can be illuminated evenly over wide areas \u2013 with adjustable lighting moods to complement existing smart home solutions.\nGlass surfaces can also generate energy. The microoptical layer in the window pane absorbs incident sunlight and transmits it in concentrated form to a solar cell. This combines the advantages of conventional windows \u2013 natural light and an unrestricted view \u2013 with the additional benefit of efficient energy production.\nAs a result, the innovative ZEISS technology will make surfaces available for power generation in the future that could not previously serve that purpose: office building facades and windows of highrise apartment buildings and other residential housing. This creates new opportunities to capture energy anywhere that glass panels are used.\nSystem technology provider instead of hardware producer\nThe innovative ZEISS technology has the potential to completely rethink parts and components in terms of design and function in many application fields. As a system provider, ZEISS does not wish to produce the components itself. Instead it will provide the unique industrial-scale replication of holograms in the form of a transparent layer to manufacturers or suppliers who wish to enhance their products and provide them with new functions. For this purpose, ZEISS is creating an entire ecosystem: from the first step through to the finished hardware, along with unrivalled advisory services and design support.\nAbout ZEISS ZEISS is a leading technology enterprise operating worldwide in the fields of optics and optoelectronics. In the previous fiscal year, the ZEISS Group generated annual revenue totaling EUR 8.8 billion in its four segments: Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology, Industrial Quality & Research, Medical Technology and Consumer Markets (status: 30 September 2022).\nFor its customers, ZEISS develops, produces and distributes highly innovative solutions for industrial metrology and quality assurance, microscopy solutions for the life sciences and materials research, and medical technology solutions for diagnostics and treatment in ophthalmology and microsurgery. The name ZEISS is also synonymous with the world's leading lithography optics, which are used by the chip industry to manufacture semiconductor components.

It is also possible to black out window glass or make projected text and images visible only from the inside or outside. Video content is also supported. As a holographic lighting system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on brake lights of cars or two-wheeled vehicles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology, with its 3D imaging, opens up new levels of design freedom for light signatures.\nFloating switches in vehicle cockpits or smart homes\nA remarkable example of the new design possibilities presented by ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass can be seen in floating switches. These are holographic, 3D human-machine interfaces based on the unique transparent layer from ZEIS. They allow 3D control elements to be displayed on demand as holographics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words, light projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the form of switches or controls on clean black-panel surfaces. They are activated by voice or gesture control only when needed. This gives a clean, contemporary look to vehicle interiors or the controls of smart household appliances.\nTransparent camera\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology permits the integration of a transparent camera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a \"holocam\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that uses coupling, decoupling and light guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor. This eliminates the need for cutouts or installation space in visible areas for cameras or sensors in the exterior for following distance alerts or parking sensors or in the interior for fatigue detection systems.\u00c2\nThe ZEISS technology also delivers significant added value for entertainment electronics products such as screens and displays that have integrated cameras. For example, the placement of the holocam at the center of the screen will allow participants in videoconferences to make eye contact. The transparency of the holographic layer has only a minimal effect on the brilliance of the image reproduction.\nIt is also possible to detect spectral components as additional information to complement the visible image. The resulting data provide insights into environmental contamination such as air pollution and UV exposure.\nInterior lighting plus energy generation\nOther applications of ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology can be found especially in the smart home. For example, innovative interior lighting can be realized through special holographic decoupling elements in exterior glass that is almost indistinguishable from natural light. Window panes can be illuminated evenly over wide areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with adjustable lighting moods to complement existing smart home solutions.\nGlass surfaces can also generate energy. The microoptical layer in the window pane absorbs incident sunlight and transmits it in concentrated form to a solar cell. This combines the advantages of conventional windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c natural light and an unrestricted view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the additional benefit of efficient energy production.\nAs a result, the innovative ZEISS technology will make surfaces available for power generation in the future that could not previously serve that purpose: office building facades and windows of highrise apartment buildings and other residential housing. This creates new opportunities to capture energy anywhere that glass panels are used.\nSystem technology provider instead of hardware producer\u00c2\nThe innovative ZEISS technology has the potential to completely rethink parts and components in terms of design and function in many application fields. As a system provider, ZEISS does not wish to produce the components itself. Instead it will provide the unique industrial-scale replication of holograms in the form of a transparent layer to manufacturers or suppliers who wish to enhance their products and provide them with new functions. For this purpose, ZEISS is creating an entire ecosystem: from the first step through to the finished hardware, along with unrivalled advisory services and design support.\nAbout ZEISS ZEISS is a leading technology enterprise operating worldwide in the fields of optics and optoelectronics.

        "raw_content": "Everything About Metrology\nZEISS at CES 2024\nMultifunctional Smart Glass for a wide range of application\nZEISS will be at the 2024 edition of CES, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest tech event, taking place from January 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 2024 in Las Vegas, to present its Multifunctional Smart Glass technology. This disruptive technology permits the optical activation of transparent media. It combines four basic functions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c projection, detection, illumination and filtering to open up entirely new holographic possibilities, from smart home solutions through to augmented reality head-up displays with minimal installation space. ESA and NASA space missions have carried this trailblazing ZEISS technology on board for many years. It is also well established in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors. At the CES \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall, W306 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ZEISS will present its industrial solutions with equipment and processes for mass production. With microoptical and holographic surfaces, they are suitable for everyday use: for more safety, interactivity, efficiency and comfort.\nReplication technology enables industrial-scale hologram production for the first time\nAt the heart of the ZEISS technology is a thin, transparent layer to which ultra-high-precision optics are attached in the smallest of spaces. It is characterized by transparency of over 92 percent combined with maximum clarity. It makes it possible for holographic technology to be used in applications where limitations of installation space, weight and costs previously stood in the way. The holographic functionality can turn any glass surface (windows of buildings, transparent screens, side windows of vehicles) into an on-demand screen for communications.\nIn the past, holograms were limited to small production runs. With the replication technology developed in the ZEISS laboratories, the fully automated duplication of a master hologram in large quantities is now possible for the first time. Roman Kleindienst, Vice President ZEISS Microoptics: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing. That\u2019s why we call it the \u2018Gutenberg moment\u2019 for holography.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHolography in the car: clear benefits for safety and comfort\nAugmented Reality HUDs have many advantages in cars: Drivers obtain all of the input they need without taking their eyes off the road. The selected information that they want or need appears within their field of vision. Other benefits are the simple functionality and additional comfort: Holographic 3D content permits\u00c2\u00a0more design, branding, guidance and information functions.

        "raw_content": "Zeiss Is Going To Introduce Transparent Camera Tech At CES 2024 \u2013 And It Will Blow Your Mind\nGerman optics giant Zeiss is set to unveil its cutting-edge Multifunctional Smart Glass technology at CES 2024. The innovation revolves around a thin polymer film that can transform any glass surface\u2014windows of buildings, transparent screens, or vehicle side windows\u2014into an on-demand screen for communications. Boasting over 92 percent transparency and featuring ultra-high-precision optics, the technology combines projection, detection, illumination, and filtering.\nInitially revealed in 2019, the Smart Glass has rapidly evolved, finding applications in augmented-reality head-up displays (HUD) for aircraft cockpits. Zeiss expanded its focus to automotive applications at IAA Mobility 2023 and is now gearing up for mass production, heralded by VP Roman Kleindienst as a \u201cGutenberg moment for holography.\u201d\nThe upcoming CES showcase will spotlight augmented-reality HUDs for car drivers, potentially extending content display to side and rear windows. This opens the door to Car2X communications, customizable window blackouts, and the possibility of projecting text and images visible only from the inside or outside. Zeiss emphasizes the technology\u2019s impact on automotive design, particularly in creating \u201cholographic\u201d brake lighting.\nOne standout application is the holocam, which eliminates the need for intrusive punch holes or notches for cameras and sensors. Positioned in the middle of a display, this technology has minimal impact on image brilliance and can gather environmental data such as air pollution and UV exposure.\nIn a strategic move, Zeiss positions itself as a system provider, offering industrial-scale replication of holograms as a transparent layer to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This allows manufacturers and suppliers to enhance their products and introduce new functionalities.

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.
