        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nBest of CES 2024: ZDNET editors' top picks\nThe ZDNET team scoured CES 2024 to find the most innovative new tech and the most exciting new products to share with our audience of professionals and tech enthusiasts. We have lots of lists summing up the best TVs, best laptops, best robots, best headphones, best mobile accessories, and more.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nBut we also wanted to give you a list of our absolute top picks from CES that we think will be most worth your hard-earned money when they launch in 2024. And naturally, we also wanted to highlight the best innovations -- products that you may not buy but are worth knowing about because they could influence other products that you may want to bring into your life in the future. So here they are.\nSamsung S95D OLED: Best TV\nTV innovation was everywhere at CES 2024 with transparent TVs, over 100-inch QLEDs, folding TVs, and 8K projectors. But the best TV of the show had a more subtle upgrade that will have a much bigger impact on the quality of the everyday viewing experience. The Samsung S95D OLED TV unveiled a glare-free display that offers the best qualities of anti-reflective screens while maintaining the intense colors and excellent dynamic range that make OLED the top technology for picture quality. We tested the glare-free display with an intense phone camera flash and were amazed at how well it dispersed the light. This means that you can now use this TV in the brightest rooms -- one of the biggest challenges for OLED TVs. I'm confident that will give this the TV with the best picture quality on the market when it launches this spring. It will likely cost around $2,500, until it gets discounted around Black Friday.\nSamsung S95D\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid: Best laptop\nWe've tested and seen plenty of 2-in-1 computers at ZDNET, but there's none quite like Lenovo's new ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. That's because this is the world's first 2-in-1 Windows PC and Android tablet, meaning as you detach the 14-inch OLED display from the keyboard, the device automatically converts into the Android operating system. On top of that, you can still connect the bottom keyboard portion of the 2-in-1 to an external monitor, giving you, essentially, two computers to work with.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub: Best AI device\nIn the past year, we have seen major leaps in the AI space, which led to a boom in translation technology at CES. The TimeKettle X1 made delivers real-time translations in up to 40 languages, with nearly no latency and high accuracy, which I got the chance to experience myself. The device itself fits in the palm of your and includes a screen that displays transcriptions of your conversation and two earbuds that two people can wear for real-time in-ear translations during a one-on-one conversation. There are a series of modes, making it ideal for every situation you may need a translation. If you sync different hubs, it can provide real-time translations for up to 20 people in five different languages, aimed for use in classrooms and meetings. The product is already available for $699 on the TimeKettle website.\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub\nMSI Claw: Best gaming device\nIn what is becoming one of the hottest product categories in recent years, the Taiwanese computer maker's first gaming handheld impresses with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor for AI enhancements to performance and gaming, a more ergonomic design (with plenty of ventilation) than its competition, and USB-C Thunderbolt support for external monitor use. The LCD display falls short to its OLED rivals, but the gaming potential of this handheld should more than compensate for it. It will start at $699 and arrive later this year.\nMSI Claw\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: Best tech accessory\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar offers the same types of insights a fitness tracker for humans would. You place the attachment on your dog's collar and on the app you will have access to data about your dog's heart health, activity, appetite, and more. The attachment can also track your dog's location, eliminating the need for additional trackers such as AirTags. One of the most important features is its ability to detect early symptoms of heart disease, potentially saving your dog's life. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category since it is through AI that the collar can detect your dog's activities, such as sleeping, walking, and more. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar is already available for $99, and it requires a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar\nHoloconnect Holobox: Best innovation overall\nThe Holoconnect Holobox makes it possible to talk to someone via a hologram with near-zero latency. It's a \"plug and play\" system, so all you need to do is plug it in and connect it to the internet to get started. To be a hologram yourself, you need a white background that is well-lit, and then you can carry on like it is a regular video call. It is already available for consumer use, and we even saw Google use the Holobox to showcase its Android characters in fun and innovative ways at CES 2024. The price is not disclosed on the Holoconnect website, but interested customers can request a pricing list. It's very expensive and most people aren't going to want to put this phone booth sized box in their living room, but the idea of video calls of the future becoming holograms is super compelling.\nHoloconnect Holobox\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV: Best TV innovation\nThe recent trend in Laser TV and ultra short throw (UST) projectors has spawned a wave of interest in 100-inch and 120-inch screens to create a more cinema-like experience at home. At CES, Samsung even unveiled an 8K projector that goes up to 150 inches. The challenge with these projectors is that they're never going to have the same level of dynamic range, brightness, or color intensity as today's best OLED and QLED TVs. TCL had an answer to that at CES with the announcement of its 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV. We were highly impressed with the picture quality of this QLED display in a private demo. It's an extension of TCL's QM8 series, which ZDNET and others have rated as one of the best TVs on the market. The TCL 115QM891G (the official product name) kicks it up a notch with 5,000 nits of brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones to drive excellent dynamic range and sharp colors. Pricing wasn't announced but it will likely cost around $20,000 and it will be available at Best Buy. That makes it an ultra-premium purchase, but if you have the space and the budget then you can now get a projector-level screen size with the benefits of the latest advances in QLED picture quality.\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV\nRabbit: Best AI innovation\nWhat if AI assistants could do more than just give you the best search results and leave you to do the rest? What if they could book an Airbnb for you, shop for groceries online and checkout, or start a return for that impulsive Black Friday purchase? That's what the folks at Rabbit are touting with R1, its new $199 pocket device that operates on a \"Large Action Model\". Made in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the R1 may be the first of many AI hardware releases in 2024. The ball is now in the court of the world's biggest tech giants to deliver superior voice assistant experiences to match the capabilities of what Rabbit has come up with.\nRabbit R1\nSony XR headset: Best VR/AR innovation\nSony gave us the biggest shocker of CES 2024 in the opening keynote of the show when it partnered with Siemens to unveil an XR headset with high-end specs and an attractive Sony design. While this headset has the oomph to compete with Apple Vision Pro, it's not aimed at a general consumer audience but is focused directly on professionals, engineers, and designers to help them accelerate product development and create spatial content experiences that could ultimately run on Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and other headsets and smart glasses. This product will have the potential to save a lot of time and resources for companies in flying people around the globe or shipping prototypes to collaborate on and finalize their products. They'll do this by creating \"digital twins\" in virtual spaces such as Siemens NX Immersive Designer. Sony won't sell the headset as a standalone device, but it will be bundled with Siemens' platform and other software packages for specific industries. That will include an entertainment industry bundle that Sony wants to use to empower the next generation of digital storytellers to build immersive 3D experiences.\nSony XR headset\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024"

Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face.

The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced.

The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 5 best monitors at CES 2024\nThe most exciting displays at the show feature some truly incredible screen specs\nIf you\u2019re a big ol\u2019 display dweeb like myself, CES 2024 is basically Christmas\u2026 just replace the big-boned, beardy dude trespassing on your premises with the best monitors and best TVs being debuted in Las Vegas in front of hordes of excited tech press.\nThe annual Sin City-based mega event has produced some particularly exciting monitors this year, a number of which boast truly ludicrous refresh rates that should have hardcore first-person shooter fans drooling. What\u2019s also becoming increasingly clear is the PC market\u2019s continued love affair with OLED technology is getting more intimate with every passing year.\nWith so many impressive new models being produced from a variety of manufacturers, the days of the traditional IPS panel look increasingly numbered if you demand impeccable black levels from your monitor.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best monitors of CES 2024 so far\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new monitor, you may want to hold out for another few months until the tantalizing displays below have been released. Some of them look simply sensational. Here are some of the best monitors we\u2019ve seen from CES so far. Buckle up screen nerds: your peepers are in for quite the ride.\n1. Acer Predator Z57\nEven as someone who owns a 49-inch gaming monitor, this thing is just silly. Yet silly in the best possible way. The Acer Predator Z57 is a colossal 57-inch, 120Hz ultrawide gaming monitor that essentially has the same screen real estate of a couple of 4K displays. It\u2019s resolution? A frankly absurd 7,680 x 2,160. Let that number sink in for a second.\nThe Z57 further impresses with 1000R curvature, which should make for quite the wraparound viewing experience in some of the best PC games. Throw in the fact it\u2019s capable of hitting 1000 nits of brightness in HDR mode and hits 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and this titan should produce beautifully accurate, utterly vibrant pictures. Just make sure you go out and purchase a desk the size of a park bench if you\u2019re planning on buying this beast.\n2. Asus ROG Swift PG27 (2024)\nThe Asus ROG Swift PG27 has always been an excellent monitor series, but this year the company is really taking things to the next level with more than a little help from Nvidia. Alongside a number of other monitors from Dell and Philips, the latest PG27 boasts the latest evolution of Team Green's G-Sync technology.\nCalled G-Sync Pulsar, Nvidia describes it as \u201cthe next evolution of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology\u201d. Said fps-smoothing tech promises to deliver not only the usual stutter-free gaming experiences you\u2019d expect from the best G-Sync monitors, but the company claims it will set \u201ca new gold standard for visual clarity and fidelity through the invention of variable frequency strobing\u201d. Nvidia promises the latest ROG Swift PG27 will boast effective motion clarity to over 1000Hz. So if you\u2019re looking for a gaming monitor capable of producing potentially the smoothest gameplay experiences we\u2019ve ever seen, this currently looks like the model to beat.\n3. Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 (2024)\nBoy, does my timing ever suck when it comes to buying new monitors. I caved and picked up the awesome Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 in an admittedly delicious Black Friday deal late last year, but now I have serious display envy thanks to the announcement of the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8. Last year\u2019s model was already a terrific gaming monitor with a screen resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 and a gorgeous OLED panel that sported a 175Hz refresh rate.\nSamsungs\u2019 latest model (full title the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G80SD), is a different beast entirely. For one thing, this 32-inch OLED gaming monitor ditches the previous G8\u2019s ultrawide aspect ratio in favor of a more traditional 16:9 form factor. That\u2019s instantly going to make it more accessible to those with limited desk space.\nThe most exciting stat is that the new G8 rocks an astoundingly speedy 240Hz refresh rate. Pair that with its 4K display (3,840 x 2,160) and response times of just 0.03ms, and this should be one hell of a gaming screen if you\u2019ve got a powerful enough GPU/CPU combo to squeeze the most out of its stunning specs.\n4. Alienware AW3225QF\nDespite the fact the amazing Alienware AW3423DWF is currently boxed up in my bedroom ready to be sold on eBay \u2014 mainly because I bought that Samsung G9 I mentioned above \u2014 I really do love Alienware monitors. I\u2019ve owned several down the years, and from a specs perspective, the Alienware AW3225QF looks to be the most impressive gaming monitor Dell has manufactured to date.\nThe headline, oh so exciting facts for display nerds? This is a 32-inch, 4K OLED monitor that has a refresh rate of 240Hz. Predictably being OLED, response times are currently quoted at just 0.03ms. Color accuracy should also be excellent, with the AW3225QF covering 99% of the DCI-P3 gamut. This panel's PPI (pixels per inch) is also higher than any existing OLED gaming monitor at 140 PPI \u2014 most existing OLED monitors max out at just over 100 PPI. My only slight concern with this is could be overly pronounced pixel density on a 32-inch screen.\nBut hey, that\u2019s ultra nerdy nitpicking on my part. This baby looks like the real deal, and we could easily see it sitting atop our picks of the best gaming monitors later in the year. It launches later this month for what I'd argue is a pretty reasonable $1,199.\n5. LG\u2019s new 480Hz monitor\nIf you\u2019re in full \u201cMaverick Mode\u201d and are craving the need for ALL the speed, LG\u2019s currently unnamed new 27-inch OLED display could be the gaming monitors of your dreams. While it may not have an official moniker yet, we know that this 1440p (or QHD) display features a refresh rate of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 480Hz. If you\u2019re an aspiring future eSports champ, you may have just found the monitor to power your aspiring competitive gaming fantasies.\nThis new LG monitor\u2019s screen credentials are further boosted by LG Display's \u201cMETA technology\u201d, last seen in the sensational LG G3 OLED TV. Essentially, it\u2019s a type of software solution that in the case of the G3, combined with that television\u2019s Micro Lens Array panel to create one of the brightest and best OLED TVs we\u2019ve ever reviewed. When this monitor finally gets a name, expect its HDR performance to be almost impressive as that head-spinning refresh rate.\nCheck out our CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nCES 2024 is in full swing, and more innovative product reveals were made on day 2 of the biggest tech show of the year. And since it's the biggest show, we know not everyone is going to catch the hundreds of announcements across the more than 4,000 exhibitors.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has cut through all the noise to bring you the most important and biggest announcements and products of day 2 that you may have missed. We were even able to go hands-on with some of these products below.\nStay tuned for even more product and big tech announcements tomorrow for CES day 3.\n1. New features coming to Android devices\nAndroid users will appreciate the several exciting announcements that Google made at CES Day 2. The most important feature coming to Android devices next month is a cross-Android solution called Quick Share. Quick Share will offer peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of Android-based devices, such as phones and even Chromebooks.\nAlso: CES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nOther new features and updates include Fast Pair support expansion, more casting capabilities to more apps and devices (including TikTok), and Android Auto integration into more vehicles like the new \u00a0Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n2. Nanoleaf's impressive smart lighting\nSmart lighting company, Nanoleaf, announced some exciting additions to its smart lighting lineup, including a new Orchestrator software for music integrations. The software connects directly to a computer's sound source and isolates the response to the device, resulting in the lights reacting to an audio track's precise different layers.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight was also revealed, which the company says is a set of square light panels that are meant to be installed on the ceiling and capable of emitting 1400 lumens per square. Other product announcements included multicolor outdoor string lights with Matter support.\n3. EcoFlow's whole-house portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra generator has been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree thanks to its impressive specs. These include a power capacity of 6kWh (an entire home), and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input. The system is also compatible with expansion packs, increasing the power capacity to a whopping 90kWh which can run power to your home's essential appliances for up to an entire month.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 gadgets you can buy right now\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz got to try this powerful generator at her own home and called it the \"Swiss Army Knife of home backup systems,\" adding that it's also \"a whisper-quiet solution, one that you can't even hear when under 2000W.\"\n4. Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best audio products at CES 2024\nMy pick of the top audio highlights to look out for in the year ahead\nCES 2024 may be wrapping up, but this year's event has been an amazing insight into what to expect in the world of consumer tech for the year ahead. The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding.

For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.

The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements. Why even post this article before you have ANY content for it?!?\nClick the number buttons under the picture, There ARE already some news items, although none really interesting yet\nTrying to wrap me noggin around a camera capturing\nthe path of a ray of light.

As I understand it, true drum-scanners for film use photo-multiplier tubes which can react to (I think) individual photons which is why they are considered the ultimate film scanners. So I was wondering if this SPAD technology could perform an equivalent function with a solid state solution?\nYou may also like\nLatest sample galleries\nLatest in-depth reviews\nThe Sony a9 III is the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to feature a global electronic shutter with simultaneous readout.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Thanks to Razer\u2019s efforts, both products received the coveted UL2809 Recycled Content Validation, an independently verified ecolabel certification from the World\u2019s leading testing, inspection and certification company, UL Solutions.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
