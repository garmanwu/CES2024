        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The company\u2019s new lineup aims to upgrade peoples\u2019 lives by delivering high-quality, purpose-driven solutions that help them make work and life simpler so they can be more balanced and productive, while doing more to protect our planet.\nTargus\u2019 2024 lineup will include an expanded line of premium, sustainable tech accessories; a new eco-friendly laptop case collection made from recycled ocean-bound plastic; an award-winning workspace intelligence system that gives enterprise IT teams full control over their modular IT ecosystems from anywhere; and a powerful, dual-host Hybrid Triple Video Docking Station with Keyboard/Video/Mouse (KVM)-sharing capabilities that can control up to two different PCs simultaneously from a single workstation.\n\u201cAs we move out of a challenging year for the tech industry and economy, alike, people are searching for something new or better to make their lives easier and more productive,\u201d explains Andrew Corkill, Vice President, Global Marketing & eCommerce, Targus. \u201cOur latest product lineup is designed to provide individuals and businesses with the quality solutions they need to carry, connect, and protect their tech wherever they go. At the same time, we\u2019ll be showcasing our expansive line of sustainable products that further demonstrate our company\u2019s ongoing commitment to protecting our planet.\u201d\nHere\u2019s just a glimpse of what Targus has in store for CES 2024 attendees.\nEcoSmart: Evolving from Cases to Tech Accessories\nAs a global leader in laptop cases and the pioneer of the first laptop bag in 1983, Targus recognizes its important responsibility to put people and the planet first. In its ongoing mission to become a more sustainable company, Targus continues to increase its emphasis through reporting and certification, improved transparency in our supply chain, and implementing a clear CO2 footprint reduction strategy aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. From a product sustainability standpoint, since 2008, Targus has been turning recycled plastic bottles into fabric to make its EcoSmart\u00ae laptop bags. Through this process, so far, Targus has diverted 18.5 million water bottles from the planet\u2019s landfills and waterways.\nTargus is also now continuing to expand this approach to create its premium, sustainable EcoSmart\u2122 tech accessories featuring up to 85 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, ultra-efficient Bluetooth\u00ae, energy harvesting, and recycled packaging. A standout example of this is Targus\u2019 award-winning ErgoFlip\u2122 EcoSmart\u2122 Mouse. This patent-pending, ergonomic and ambidextrous mouse easily converts from left- to right-handed use with a simple twist of the top. It\u2019s the first ergonomic mouse that easily works with either hand while also delivering eco-friendly benefits important to today\u2019s consumers. In fact, this mouse was recently named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree and received a Good Design\u00ae award for demonstrating outstanding innovation in design and sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, Targus will be introducing several new ergonomic wired and wireless options in the EcoSmart Tech Accessories collection ranging in price from $49.99 to $119.99 SRP.\nRescuing Ocean-Bound Plastic to Make Laptop Bags\nTaking its EcoSmart journey a step further, brand new for 2024, Targus will be launching its Coastline EcoSmart Collection of laptop bags made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyester created from certified ocean-bound plastic. While there are five trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans now and 11 million tons entering our oceans each year, according to 2023 data from Oceancycle, unfortunately, most ocean plastics cannot be recycled. The best alternative solution is to recover and recycle plastic waste that is ocean-bound, meaning it\u2019s recovered from within 30 miles of an ocean coastline or major waterway that feeds into the ocean.\nTargus is doing just that with its new 15-16\u201d Coastline EcoSmart Collection. Good on the inside and out, these stylish, eco-friendly bags feature outer material made from 900D polyester which is created from certified ocean-bound plastic and the internal lining from 140D Recycled PET. The backpack has the equivalent of 69 percent recycled content and 26 percent ocean-bound plastic, whereas the briefcase incorporates 70 percent recycled content and 24 percent ocean bound plastic content. Both laptop cases also feature a dedicated laptop compartment with sling protection using neoprene made from recycled materials, ergonomic shoulder straps and durable carry handles, luggage trolley pass-through strap, and Targus\u2019 industry-leading Lifetime Limited Warranty.\nLaunching in Q1 2024, the new Coastline Backpack is priced at $89.99 and the Coastline Briefcase at $69.99 SRP.\nWorkspace Insights at Your Fingertips\nAnother key innovation that Targus will have front and center at CES 2024 is its revolutionary MiraLogic\u00ae Workspace Intelligence System. This unique workspace intelligence system, which is also a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, combines both patented and patent-pending enterprise-grade hardware with proprietary cloud-based software, to provide\u202ftechnical and management teams with full remote control and visibility over their\u202fmodular IT ecosystems across the enterprise. This allows organizations to efficiently analyze, control, and manage their workspace assets anywhere (e.g., power consumption, workspace utilization, and real-time occupancy) to increase employee productivity, reduce costs, and improve sustainability.\nMiraLogic\u2019s newly released software version offers three major enhancements: Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates without an attached host device allow IT teams to perform regular device updates from any location (patent pending). Proactive notifications immediately alert IT teams of potential issues or events. Lastly, Single Sign-On (SSO) makes logging into the system seamless for users.

The company's new lineup aims to upgrade peoples' lives by delivering high-quality, purpose-driven solutions that help them make work and life simpler so they can be more balanced and productive, while doing more to protect our planet.\nTargus' 2024 lineup will include an expanded line of premium, sustainable tech accessories; a new eco-friendly laptop case collection made from recycled ocean-bound plastic; an award-winning workspace intelligence system that gives enterprise IT teams full control over their modular IT ecosystems from anywhere; and a powerful, dual-host Hybrid Triple Video Docking Station with Keyboard/Video/Mouse (KVM)-sharing capabilities that can control up to two different PCs simultaneously from a single workstation.\n\"As we move out of a challenging year for the tech industry and economy, alike, people are searching for something new or better to make their lives easier and more productive,\" explains Andrew Corkill, Vice President, Global Marketing & eCommerce, Targus. \"Our latest product lineup is designed to provide individuals and businesses with the quality solutions they need to carry, connect, and protect their tech wherever they go. At the same time, we'll be showcasing our expansive line of sustainable products that further demonstrate our company's ongoing commitment to protecting our planet.\"\nHere's just a glimpse of what Targus has in store for CES 2024 attendees.\nEcoSmart: Evolving from Cases to Tech Accessories\nAs a global leader in laptop cases and the pioneer of the first laptop bag in 1983, Targus recognizes its important responsibility to put people and the planet first. In its ongoing mission to become a more sustainable company, Targus continues to increase its emphasis through reporting and certification, improved transparency in our supply chain, and implementing a clear CO2 footprint reduction strategy aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. From a product sustainability standpoint, since 2008, Targus has been turning recycled plastic bottles into fabric to make its EcoSmart\u00ae laptop bags. Through this process, so far, Targus has diverted 18.5 million water bottles from the planet's landfills and waterways.\nTargus is\u00a0also now continuing to expand this approach to create its premium, sustainable EcoSmart\u2122 tech accessories featuring up to 85 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, ultra-efficient Bluetooth\u00ae, energy harvesting, and recycled packaging. A standout example of this is Targus' award-winning ErgoFlip\u2122 EcoSmart\u2122 Mouse. This patent-pending, ergonomic and ambidextrous mouse easily converts from left- to right-handed use with a simple twist of the top. It's the first ergonomic mouse that easily works with either hand while also delivering eco-friendly benefits important to today's consumers. In fact, this mouse was recently named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree and received a Good Design\u00ae award for demonstrating outstanding innovation in design and sustainability.\nAdditionally, Targus will be introducing several new ergonomic wired and wireless options in the EcoSmart Tech Accessories collection ranging in price from $49.99 to $119.99 SRP.\nRescuing Ocean-Bound Plastic to Make Laptop Bags\nTaking its EcoSmart journey a step further, brand new for 2024, Targus will be launching its Coastline EcoSmart Collection of laptop bags made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyester created from certified ocean-bound plastic. While there are five trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans now and 11 million tons entering our oceans each year, according to 2023 data from Oceancycle, unfortunately, most ocean plastics cannot be recycled. The best alternative solution is to recover and recycle plastic waste that is ocean-bound, meaning it's recovered from within 30 miles of an ocean coastline or major waterway that feeds into the ocean.\nTargus is doing just that with its new 15-16\" Coastline EcoSmart Collection. Good on the inside and out, these stylish, eco-friendly bags feature outer material made from 900D polyester which is created from certified ocean-bound plastic and the internal lining from 140D Recycled PET. The backpack has the equivalent of 69 percent recycled content and 26 percent ocean-bound plastic, whereas the briefcase incorporates 70 percent recycled content and 24 percent ocean bound plastic content. Both laptop cases also feature a dedicated laptop compartment with sling protection using neoprene made from recycled materials, ergonomic shoulder straps and durable carry handles, luggage trolley pass-through strap, and Targus' industry-leading Lifetime Limited Warranty.\nLaunching in Q1 2024, the new Coastline Backpack is priced at $89.99 and the Coastline Briefcase at $69.99 SRP.\nWorkspace Insights at Your Fingertips\nAnother key innovation that Targus will have front and center at CES 2024 is its revolutionary MiraLogic\u00ae Workspace Intelligence System. This unique workspace intelligence system, which is also a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, combines both patented and patent-pending enterprise-grade hardware with proprietary cloud-based software, to provide\u00a0technical and management teams with full remote control and visibility over their\u00a0modular IT ecosystems across the enterprise. This allows organizations to efficiently analyze, control, and manage their workspace assets anywhere (e.g., power consumption, workspace utilization, and real-time occupancy) to increase employee productivity, reduce costs, and improve sustainability.\nMiraLogic's newly released software version offers three major enhancements: Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates without an attached host device allow IT teams to perform regular device updates from any location (patent pending). Proactive notifications immediately alert IT teams of potential issues or events. Lastly, Single Sign-On (SSO) makes logging into the system seamless for users. Attendees can stop by Targus' booth to see the new and improved MiraLogic in action.\nSwitch it Up\nAs a global leader in docking, Targus continues to introduce universal docking stations to keep its customers organized, connected, and productive at home, in the office, or on the go. This year at CES, Targus will have its exciting USB-C\u00ae Dual Host Hybrid Triple Video KVM Docking Station with Dual 100W Power on full display. This enterprise universal/hybrid docking station features built-in Dual Host with KVM-sharing capabilities to make it seamless and easy to connect and control two laptops and share up to three monitors and several peripherals between them while docked.\nWhether you're a software developer who needs to access two environments at once; a product team that needs to quickly collaborate on the spot; a network engineer who needs to access two systems; or even a remote worker who wants to keep their work and personal computer connected and within arm's reach, maximize your efficiency with this powerful docking station.\nDOCK750 is available now at Targus.com and participating retailers worldwide for $499.99.\nDiscover the Targus Alliance Advantage\nDon't miss Targus' lineup of alliance and gaming laptop bags and accessories at CES which will also be featured in Targus' Augmented Reality (AR) experience whereby attendees can try out a variety of different backpacks and see how they look.\nTargus is a trusted partner to leading global PC OEMs, known for its global design leadership and expertise, turnkey strategic support, and wide range of Alliance laptop cases and accessories.

CES\u2019 elite panel of judges recognized MiraLogic as one of the most innovative products being introduced at CES 2024 which demonstrates key features and benefits that contribute to a more sustainable planet.\nMiraLogic is a unique workspace intelligence system that combines both patented and patent-pending enterprise-grade hardware and proprietary cloud software to give technical and management teams full remote control and visibility over their modular IT ecosystems across the enterprise. This allows organizations to efficiently analyze, control, and manage their workspace assets anywhere (e.g., power consumption, workspace utilization, and real-time occupancy). By providing valuable, real-time insights to make data-driven decisions about running costs of power, energy, equipment, and desk usage, organizations can achieve their sustainability goals more effectively while empowering employees to work productively from anywhere.\n\u201cToday\u2019s organizations need to support a distributed workforce efficiently and sustainably,\u201d explains Ron DeCamp, Vice President, Global Product Management & Development, Targus. \u201cEnterprise decisionmakers are concerned about the impact of lower office attendance and occupancy on wasted office space, inefficient asset support, and wasted energy costs. MiraLogic helps organizations solve these challenges by enabling them to reassess their working practices, aligning future decision-making around those priorities.\u201d\nMiraLogic fuses support capabilities with utilization and energy consumption monitoring analytics to create a secure, cloud-based workstation solution, offering businesses:\nIts cloud-based software features an AWS-hosted user interface and dashboards, compatibility with all OS and browsers, no \u2018Smart Dock\u2019 agent software required to be installed on host devices, and a robust API capability for integration into third-party platforms (Managed Software, ERP, and SCCM), or similar.\nThe hardware comprises a universal USB-C dock (installed via the desktop, tray or VESA\u00ae mount), smart BT sensor (installed on or under the desk), smart retrofit adapter/smart gateway for legacy Targus docks, and smart power strip (installed under the desk).\nConsumers and media can get a firsthand look and technical demonstration of MiraLogic, including its exciting, new software enhancements, at CES 2024, the most powerful tech event in the world happening in Las Vegas, Jan. 9th-12th. Targus\u2019 booth #15945 will be located in the Central Hall within the Las Vegas Convention Center. Additionally, this revolutionary workspace management system will be on display in the CES Innovation Awards Showcase and at CES Unveiled, CES\u2019 premier media preview event taking place at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on the evening of January 7th.\n###\nAbout the 2024 CES Innovation Awards\nThe CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products. The program recognizes honorees in a multitude of consumer technology product categories and distinguishes the highest rated in each. An elite panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers, engineers and more, reviewed submissions based on innovation, engineering and functionality, aesthetic and design.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Award Honorees, including product descriptions and photos, can be found at CES.tech/innovation.

Thanks to CES, we've seen a ton of innovative tech launch into the marketplace. While many products announced at CES won't be available till later this year, a fair number are already for sale. Check out this curated selection of devices available for purchase or preorder. (The preorder items listed here should ship within just a month or two.)\nMore CES 2024 Coverage\nIf you miss having a physical keyboard on your smartphone, the Clicks case might be the solution for you.\nIf you miss having a physical keyboard on your smartphone, the Clicks case might be the solution for you. It comes with a built-in physical QWERTY keyboard that you can use with your iPhone. The best part is that the virtual keyboard won\u2019t appear unless you force it to, so you get back that screen real estate as you type. It does add some height to the phone, but it\u2019s super cute and has backlit keys. It also supports Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts. The case is only available for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can order it now and select models will start shipping in February. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\nHP\u2019s new Spectre x360 laptops feature Neural Processing Units (NPUs), which allow them to perform some AI-type computation without sending your data off to the cloud, which is what usually happens with AI queries. That's good for privacy, but might not be great for battery life. To help conserve battery life, the new Spectre x360s have a 2.8K OLED display that dims when you look away and adjusts its refresh rate based on content. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\nCelestron\u2019s new screen-based telescope, Origin, allows you to explore the stars via the 6.4-megapixel sensor, which projects images to your smart device. You can set up the Origin outside and relax on the couch, projecting the heavens onto your TV. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\nAnker showed off a ton of wireless chargers at CES 2024, and almost all of these are Qi2-certified\u2014that\u2019s the newest wireless charging standard, and we have a whole explainer you can read to learn more here. All of these chargers have different functions in one way or another. The Anker MagGo Power Bank ($90) has a 10,000-mAh capacity and a built-in kickstand, with a display on the side to show how much juice is left. There\u2019s a smaller 6,600-mAh version that drops the display but has a stand. If you want to spend as little as possible, there\u2019s the MagGo Wireless Charging Magnetic Pad ($22), and then a new version of the original MagGo Charging Station ($100), which has MagSafe on the front, three AC outlets on the back, two USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports. Lastly, there\u2019s the 3-in-1 Charging Station ($110) for Apple users, which I\u2019ve actually been using here at CES to top up my phone. It\u2019s a nice compact travel solution if you have an Apple Watch, iPhone, and AirPods. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nPunkt MC02\nThis smartphone packs our favorite software coming out of CES 2024. The Apostrophy OS is based on GrapheneOS, which is based on Android, and replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software to instead have a privacy-focused alternative Android operating system. Instead of collecting and selling your data, it has a $15 monthly subscription to use Apostrophy OS after the first year. The Punkt MC02 itself has a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, 6 GB of RAM, and a 64-megapixel primary camera. You can order the MC02 now and it ships in the next month. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSegway\u2019s transforming Go Kart is probably the most fun thing I tested at CES, and I don\u2019t take that lightly (or say that about Segway, normally). In its first form, it\u2019s a fun and zippy little Go Kart, with a max speed of 26.7 mph and plenty of pickup that corners nicely around the turns. In its second form, the back end detaches to become a little floating hoverboard. Finally, roll it into your house, park it in front of the TV, and it becomes a tiny racing sim. It\u2019s compatible with most major consoles and games and has full 360 haptic feedback, as I discovered when I decided that CES was the right time to learn how to drift. This is the perfect toy for a wealthy 13-year-old, or perhaps more appropriately, a 40-year-old mom.\u2014Adrienne So\nDo you hate pulling out your phone every time you need to do some boring, mundane thing like DoorDash a hot dog or call an Uber? You might need (or just want) a Rabbit R1, an adorable, pocket-sized AI device. It\u2019s about the size of a stack of Post-its with a screen, button, touchscreen, and camera. When you need to run an errand, just push a button, give it a voice command, and send a rabbit to do all the boring stuff that takes up time in your life: add a song to a Spotify playlist, make a reservation at your favorite restaurant. It does require its own cellular connection, but it could save you a ton of time and energy. Read Julian Chokkattu\u2019s full story for more. Also, just know the first batch sold out in one day (!) but the company is taking preorders for the next batch. \u2014Adrienne So\nDreaming of a bidet? What about a bidet you can control like a smart speaker? Kohler\u2019s PureWash E930 bidet seat can be added on to your existing toilet, with features ranging from adjustable water temperatures and pressure to a heated seat, air dryer, and a motion-activated cover. But perhaps the most surprising feature is that it works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, so you could ask your voice assistant of choice to activate the bidet or dryer. The included remote would certainly be faster to use, but voice control does mean you can have a fully hands-free experience. It\u2019s available now for preorder. \u2014Nena Farrell\nRazer\u2019s Iskur v2 gaming chair is on sale for $649.\nChipolo\u2019s team takes scuffs and marks seriously, which has turned into thousands of perfectly workable, but slightly less beautiful, wallet trackers getting removed from the product lineup\u2014until now, with the limited edition Perfectly Imperfect version of the CARD Spot. The cards are made with plastic injection molding, which can result in minor streaks on the finish instead of being perfectly smooth, but now instead of throwing those cards away, they\u2019re available to purchase. The interior technology works normally, and shopping one of these helps keep plastic from getting discarded. The Perfectly Imperfect line is available now starting at $35. \u2014Nena Farrell\nWe tested the Trek Fetch+ 2 on a several-hours-long ride through Red Rocks Canyon outside Vegas. It\u2019s a compact electric cargo longtail bike that\u2019s big enough for two kids to sit on; I toted my backpack in the rear racks. It has a hydroformed alloy low-step frame with an integrated battery and a Bosch Performance Line Cargo motor, all atop very fun and maneuverable 20-inch wheels. Mount your phone and let it charge while you ride and watch your stats in Bosch\u2019s eBike Flow app. Auto mode lets the bike apply just enough power to keep your level of effort consistent, no matter what the terrain looks like. It feels so natural that it\u2019s confusing. I kept shifting to and fro trying to figure out why I wasn\u2019t pedaling harder uphill. \u2014Adrienne So\nConsidering RCA\u2019s mascots are dogs Nipper and Chipper, it makes sense that the brand would expand into pet gadgets. Two automatic feeders hold 6 liters of dry kibble. You can schedule mealtimes or set it off manually via the app, and they also work with Google Assistant and Alexa. The $100 feeder comes equipped with a 1080p camera and the $80 version is camera-less. There\u2019s also a $100 treat dispenser with a 1080p camera so you can launch a treat out rather than fill up a dinner bowl. For each purchase of those three devices, RCA is donating $1 to K9 for Warriors. \u2014Medea Giordano\nPet tech was a theme this year, particularly trackers that keep tabs on pet health. The Invoxia Minitailz measures respiratory and heart vitals, detects atrial fibrillation, and tracks anomalies in behavior. The app compiles all the tracked data into easily digestible information that should give you a good idea on if you need to contact a vet, hopefully long before something serious happens. There\u2019s also GPS tracking if your pet gets lost. The dog version is available for purchase now for $99 plus an $8.30 per month (about $100 a year) subscription. The cat version should be available in March. \u2014Medea Giordano\nJLab\u2019s latest micro-sized ANC earbuds are notable not only for their tiny form factor, but also their slim-size price of just $60. This third-gen model comes with some solid features, including both noise canceling and transparency modes, basic EQ via the JLab app, and up to nine hours of playback time per charge without ANC. The budget brand also showed off its \u201cfirst foray into the higher-end market\u201d with the Lux ANC, an $80 pair of noise-canceling, over-ear headphones that have 70 hours of playtime per charge, spatial audio support, and Bluetooth multipoint to connect to your phone and PC at the same time. The headphones can be preordered now for expected shipping in mid-February, while the earbuds are available now. \u2014Ryan Waniata\nWhen does a monitor become a TV and vice versa? LG\u2019s new 4K MyView Smart Monitor series blurs the lines, offering built-in smarts via LG\u2019s webOS so you can stream from the screen directly, no PC required. This 32-inch model offers HDR support, good color coverage, and comes with a remote and detachable webcam, though its 60-Hz refresh rate could be limiting for gamers. \u2014Ryan Waniata\nIf you\u2019re worried about having backup power for your entire home, EcoFlow\u2019s new Delta Pro Ultra promises to back up enough output power for every appliance in your abode\u2014even the air conditioning. The Delta Pro Ultra can charge via solar panels, your local grid, or even an external generator, so there\u2019s plenty of ways to power it up ahead of any expected outages or just for peace of mind. The 90-kWh battery also promises to store enough backup power for a month of \u201cessential\u201d use of a \u201cstandard household,\u201d to keep the lights and fridge running. The Delta Pro Ultra is on sale now, and is stackable if your home needs more than one. \u2014Nena Farrell\nSince its debut last year, Sightful\u2019s Spacetop AR laptop has been reserved for early adopters. Now it's available for everyone to purchase\u2014no invitation required. The entire setup comes with a pair of glasses and a full-size keyboard and touchpad. Power it up, put on the glasses, and you have instant access to a 100-inch screen that displays as many windows and apps as you need. It\u2019s a somewhat futuristic but also convenient solution for those who want to get work done on the go but can\u2019t bring their multi-monitor setup along with them. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\nLast year, we tried the feather-light Targus Zero Waste EcoSmart Backpack made from 20 recycled water bottles. This year, the brand expanded its EcoSmart lineup with a backpack and briefcase with 900-denier polyester exteriors made from ocean-bound plastic\u2014which means it was recovered within 30 miles of an ocean coastline or major waterway that feeds into the ocean\u2014and 140-denier recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) interiors. Both have a secure laptop compartment with a recycled neoprene sling to minimize movement. Targus says the Coastline backpack has the equivalent of 69 percent recycled content and 26 percent ocean-bound plastic, and the briefcase is 70 percent recycled and 24 percent ocean-bound plastic. \u2014Medea Giordano\nIf your concern is with your pet\u2019s weight, Ilume\u2019s Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite tracks your dog\u2019s activity level and daily routines to recommend exactly how many calories they should be eating. The bowl has a light ring that closes as you add the right amount of food so you don\u2019t have to figure out measurements. It\u2019s pricey though at $250 to $300 right now depending on the batch you get. After March, it will likely reach its full price of $350. \u2014Medea Giordano\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nOn the outside, the Terra Earbuds look like your standard over-ear bone conduction workout buds. But the coolest part is that these also function as both an activity tracker and AI sports trainer. Whenever you start tracking your workouts while listening to music, you can also leverage its AI feature to build a personalized training program. And, once it\u2019s ready, you can then set your heart rate and pace thresholds and the earbuds will pulse on your head to keep you at the right speed. These are currently available for preorder. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\nMaxi-Cosi\u2019s brand-new baby monitor has everything you\u2019d usually want from a baby monitor: pan and tilt controls, a handheld parent display, built-in temperature sensors and soothing sounds, and a 2K video feed to the smartphone app. But it also has something you wouldn\u2019t usually find: AI that can identify a baby\u2019s cries, called CryAssist. The See Pro 360\u00b0 can identify a baby\u2019s cries as sleepy, hungry, fussy, gassy, or agitated, and has descriptors for how it identified the cry. The app can track what kind of cries it hears in a little calendar so that you can look back and spot trends of when your baby tends to get hungry or fussy. Even with such a cool feature, it\u2019s still well priced, costing $199. \u2014Nena Farrell\nThe SM1 Slim is Satechi\u2019s first mechanical keyboard. It comes with a 75 percent layout, low-profile brown switches, removable keycaps, and an adjustable white backlight. In addition to Bluetooth support, it also comes with a 2.4-GHz USB receiver that you can wirelessly connect to another device. Meanwhile, the keyboard itself can connect to four devices in total, like your laptop, tablet, or phone. It\u2019s also compatible with macOS (as well as iPadOS and iOS), Windows OS, and Google Chrome OS. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\nThe Renew is Airthings\u2019 first-ever air purifier. It comes with a four-stage HEPA-13 filter that removes 99.97 percent of particles along with a high-performance carbon filter for removing odors and gases from the air. Designed for larger bedrooms, it can filter clean rooms up to 525 square feet within 10 minutes. You can also stand it upright, mount it to a wall, or lay it flat. It comes with three modes, including Silent mode (reduces noise output to 23 decibels), Auto mode (uses a sensor to detect changes in air quality and adjusts the fan speed accordingly), and Boost mode (runs the fan at its highest setting for an hour). Using the Airthings companion app, you can view air quality trends, control the air purifier, and reorder more filters. It\u2019s currently available for preorder. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\nAudio-Technica\u2019s classy new AirPods-style wireless earbuds feature impressive features, including customizable noise canceling, multiple calling modes, multipoint pairing, and two types of ear tips for an adaptable fit. Perhaps the best part is their $200 price point, which comes in well below the brand\u2019s TWX9 flagship buds. \u2014Ryan Waniata\nThe latest Razer Blade 16 laptop improves on the already incredible display on the Razer Blade 14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) by switching to an OLED panel, giving it those infinitely deep blacks that make colors really pop. We haven\u2019t tested this model out yet, but given Razer\u2019s track record, we\u2019ve got high expectations for this one. The Razer Blade 16 starts at $3,000 with a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 1-TB SSD, but it can be configured up to an RTX 4090 and a truly absurd amount of storage and RAM if you have several thousand more dollars to throw at a gaming laptop. \u2014Eric Ravenscraft\nA projector is a big choice for your home theater no matter how you approach it. A good projector can be a few thousand dollars to start with, plus at least a few hundred dollars for a basic screen (and thousands for a really good one). So, from that perspective, AWOL\u2019s Vision Vanish Laser TV system isn\u2019t quite as absurdly priced as it seems, though you\u2019re still paying for convenience\u2014this system is about as all-in-one as a projector can get. It consists of an entertainment unit with a slide-out drawer where an AWOL LTV-3500 (included, mercifully!) can sit, tucked away when not in use. It also has a motorized, retractable 100-inch screen (or you can upgrade to the gigantic 120-inch model for an extra $1,000) that can roll up and disappear when you don\u2019t need it. This has everything you need for a projector-based home theater in a single box, with the possible exception of an external sound system, though even the built-in speakers in the LTV-3500 are pretty nice. \u2014Eric Ravenscraft\nElana Klein\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\n\ud83d\udce8 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter\nHow not to be stupid about AI, with Yann LeCun\nBlood, guns, and broken scooters: The chaotic rise and fall of Bird\nThe year the millennial internet died\nWomen in the US are stockpiling abortion pills\nWhat it\u2019s like to use Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode\n\ud83d\udd0c Charge right into travel season with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs\nJulian Chokkattu\nScott Gilbertson\nGear Team\nGear Team\nScott Gilbertson\nReece Rogers\nJustin Pot\nWIRED Staff\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

CES\u2019 elite panel of judges recognized MiraLogic as one of the most innovative products being introduced at CES 2024 which demonstrates key features and benefits that contribute to a more sustainable planet. MiraLogic is a unique workspace intelligence system that combines both patented and patent-pending enterprise-grade hardware and proprietary cloud software to give technical and management teams full remote control and visibility over their modular IT ecosystems across the enterprise. This allows organizations to efficiently analyse, control, and manage their workspace assets anywhere (e.g., power consumption, workspace utilization, and real-time occupancy). By providing valuable, real-time insights to make data-driven decisions about running costs of power, energy, equipment, and desk usage, organizations can achieve their sustainability goals more effectively while empowering employees to work productively from anywhere.\u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s organizations need to support a distributed workforce efficiently and sustainably,\u201d explains Ron DeCamp, Vice President, Global Product Management & Development, Targus. \u201cEnterprise decisionmakers are concerned about the impact of lower office attendance and occupancy on wasted office space, inefficient asset support, and wasted energy costs. MiraLogic helps organizations solve these challenges by enabling them to reassess their working practices, aligning future decision-making around those priorities.\u201dMiraLogic fuses support capabilities with utilization and energy consumption monitoring analytics to create a secure, cloud-based workstation solution, offering businesses:\nIts cloud-based software features an AWS-hosted user interface and dashboards, compatibility with all OS and browsers, no \u2018Smart Dock\u2019 agent software required to be installed on host devices, and a robust API capability for integration into third-party platforms (Managed Software, ERP, and SCCM), or similar.The hardware comprises a universal USB-C dock (installed via the desktop, tray or VESA\u00ae mount), smart BT sensor (installed on or under the desk), smart retrofit adapter/smart gateway for legacy Targus docks, and smart power strip (installed under the desk).Consumers and media can get a firsthand look and technical demonstration of MiraLogic, including its exciting, new software enhancements, at CES 2024, the most powerful tech event in the world happening in Las Vegas, 9-12 January. Targus\u2019 booth #15945 will be located in the Central Hall within the Las Vegas Convention Center. Additionally, this revolutionary workspace management system will be on display in the CES Innovation Awards Showcase and at CES Unveiled, CES\u2019 premier media preview event taking place at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on the evening of 7 January.\nAbout the 2024 CES Innovation AwardsThe CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is an annual competition honouring outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Everything revealed so far, from Nvidia and Sony to the weirdest reveals and helpful AI\nCES 2024 is here! The TechCrunch team is in Las Vegas this week to take in all of the action and decipher what it means to you. You already know what we\u2019re expecting, so sit back, relax and stay tuned throughout the week as we bring you the products, announcements and startup news that you need to know.\nKicking off the first day were some bigger announcements from companies, including Nvidia, LG, Sony and Samsung. Those livestreams have ended, but you can watch most of their archives and catch up right here. And with the event still ongoing, and the show floor open, here\u2019s how you can follow along with our team\u2019s coverage.\nOr, to dive into each day\u2019s updates directly, you can follow these links:\nFriday, January 12\nAnother desktop CNC mill\nCoast Runner CNC mill shown at CES 2024. Image Credits:\u00a0Haje Kamps\nEarlier in the week, Haje Jan Kamps took a closer look at Rownd. Then he found Coast Runner, a new entrant in the desktop CNC milling industry. This company, Haje writes, is promising to make the technology accessible to everyone, from professionals to hobbyists and is breaking down the barriers of traditional CNC milling with a focus on power, compact size and, most importantly, education.\nEquity talks CES\nIn today\u2019s Equity, Alex Wilhelm and Mary Ann Azevedo are joined by Kirsten Korosec and Haje Jan Kamps to discuss, among other things, some of the cool stuff that came out of CES, including\u00a0this Bane-style mask,\u00a0ChatGPT in cars and eVTOLs.\nThursday, January 11\nSmart pepper spray 444 is back\nHaje Jan Kamps is taking another look at 444, a smart pepper spray startup he had written about at CES 2023. 444, he writes, is back again, now with a Mace partnership under its belt and about to start manufacturing.\nMatter-compatible devices\nNanoleaf\u2019s new Matter-compatible indoor light strips.

There is AI for that, however, one company is taking a different approach.\u00a0EyeQ is developing a\u00a0device that attaches to your laptop and, through the use of a mirror, enables you to maintain eye contact with the person you\u2019re speaking to, even while looking at your screen.\nFrom TechCrunch+: Hyundai talks hydrogen, Siri needs to get smarter\nA Hyundai Motor Co. Nexo fuel cell electric vehicle displayed at the 2021 Ulsan International Hydrogen Energy Exhibition & Forum (H2WORLD) in Ulsan, South Korea, on Wednesday, Nov. 10, 2021. South Korea will cut prices of liquefied natural gas needed to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles for three years to encourage usage of the technology. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nAs Tim De Chant notes, Hyundai has invested in hydrogen fuel cells for decades, but it has also been one of the more successful legacy automakers at navigating the electric transition. So it\u2019s odd now that a company with so much momentum on its side would throw a hydrogen Hail Mary at CES.\nMeanwhile, Haje Jan Kamps had a lot of time to contemplate how Siri works while driving to Las Vegas. He shares some areas where Apple\u2019s voice assistant, Siri, is being left in the dust by its competitors.\nWhispp gives a voice to people who can\u2019t speak\nImage Credits: Whispp (opens in a new window)\nWhispp is working to change the game for individuals with speech disorders and voice disabilities, bringing voice boxes into the current millennium with its groundbreaking AI-powered assistive speech and phone-calling app. The company launched its newest phone-calling feature that converts whispered and vocal cord-impaired speech into a user\u2019s natural voice in real time.\nRownd designs a better tabletop CNC lathe\nRownd CNC lathe at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. Image Credits: Rownd\nHaje Jan Kamps was keeping tabs on Rownd\u2019s new tabletop CNC lathe and got to see it in action this week. He writes that what sets Rownd Lathe apart is not just its relatively affordable hardware (the machine retails at around $5k) but the accompanying software that democratizes the design process, enabling beginners to easily create or utilize pre-made designs from the open-source Rownd Library. Watch it craft a chess pawn.\nWednesday, January 10\nZoe Care gives another take on fall detection\nZoe Care smart plug. Image Credits: Zoe Care\nDevin Coldewey found what Zoe Care was doing in the area of fall detection and elderly autonomy interesting. The company uses existing Wi-Fi signals (and the way our bodies change how Wi-Fi reception works) to detect humans and their activities.\nUnlike the Serenity desktop fall detection network we discussed earlier this week, Zoe\u2019s\u00a0device doubles as a smart plug, and uses a sensor to gather and analyze Wi-Fi signals. If a fall is detected, these signals are translated into alerts on a mobile application. Covering up to 800 sq. ft., just one device can secure multiple rooms or even an entire floor, making it an efficient, cost-effective solution.\nWTF is a \u2018software-defined vehicle?\u2019\nA red car illustration with a loading bar on the windshield. Image Credits:\u00a0Lyudinka/Getty Images (modified by TechCrunch)\nThat\u2019s the question Harri Weber set out to answer after hearing the phrase uttered all over the CES floor. In it\u2019s most simplest definition, it\u2019s a vehicle defined by software. However, as Harri spoke with various experts, we learn the term can mean various things. Go inside the journey to find out why this is such a popular automotive buzzword.\nThe weirdest tech of CES 2024 (so far)\nImage credits: LG\nOne thing is consistent throughout every CES: weird and unexpected gadgets and gizmos appear from unexpected places. We have a rundown of some of the most noteworthy products and services here, which include expensive binoculars with birdwatching AI, voice-absorbing muzzles, pay-as-you-go bathroom access and a router that tries to fit your aesthetic.\n$2,000 earbuds, silent speech and AI-powered wearable jewelry\nImage credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nBeyond the outright strange products and platforms, there are some hidden gems amid the big booths and name brands at CES.

It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together.

The company's new lineup aims to upgrade peoples' lives by delivering high-quality, purpose-driven solutions that help them make work and life simpler so they can be more balanced and productive, while doing more to protect our planet.\nTargus' 2024 lineup will include an expanded line of premium, sustainable tech accessories; a new eco-friendly laptop case collection made from recycled ocean-bound plastic; an award-winning workspace intelligence system that gives enterprise IT teams full control over their modular IT ecosystems from anywhere; and a powerful, dual-host Hybrid Triple Video Docking Station with Keyboard/Video/Mouse (KVM)-sharing capabilities that can control up to two different PCs simultaneously from a single workstation.\n\"As we move out of a challenging year for the tech industry and economy, alike, people are searching for something new or better to make their lives easier and more productive,\" explains Andrew Corkill, Vice President, Global Marketing & eCommerce, Targus. \"Our latest product lineup is designed to provide individuals and businesses with the quality solutions they need to carry, connect, and protect their tech wherever they go. At the same time, we'll be showcasing our expansive line of sustainable products that further demonstrate our company's ongoing commitment to protecting our planet.\"\nHere's just a glimpse of what Targus has in store for CES 2024 attendees.\nEcoSmart: Evolving from Cases to Tech Accessories\nAs a global leader in laptop cases and the pioneer of the first laptop bag in 1983, Targus recognizes its important responsibility to put people and the planet first. In its ongoing mission to become a more sustainable company, Targus continues to increase its emphasis through reporting and certification, improved transparency in our supply chain, and implementing a clear CO2 footprint reduction strategy aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. From a product sustainability standpoint, since 2008, Targus has been turning recycled plastic bottles into fabric to make its EcoSmart\u00ae laptop bags. Through this process, so far, Targus has diverted 18.5 million water bottles from the planet's landfills and waterways.\nTargus is\u00a0also now continuing to expand this approach to create its premium, sustainable EcoSmart\u2122 tech accessories featuring up to 85 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, ultra-efficient Bluetooth\u00ae, energy harvesting, and recycled packaging. A standout example of this is Targus' award-winning ErgoFlip\u2122 EcoSmart\u2122 Mouse. This patent-pending, ergonomic and ambidextrous mouse easily converts from left- to right-handed use with a simple twist of the top. It's the first ergonomic mouse that easily works with either hand while also delivering eco-friendly benefits important to today's consumers. In fact, this mouse was recently named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree and received a Good Design\u00ae award for demonstrating outstanding innovation in design and sustainability.\nAdditionally, Targus will be introducing several new ergonomic wired and wireless options in the EcoSmart Tech Accessories collection ranging in price from $49.99 to $119.99 SRP.\nRescuing Ocean-Bound Plastic to Make Laptop Bags\nTaking its EcoSmart journey a step further, brand new for 2024, Targus will be launching its Coastline EcoSmart Collection of laptop bags made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyester created from certified ocean-bound plastic. While there are five trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans now and 11 million tons entering our oceans each year, according to 2023 data from Oceancycle, unfortunately, most ocean plastics cannot be recycled. The best alternative solution is to recover and recycle plastic waste that is ocean-bound, meaning it's recovered from within 30 miles of an ocean coastline or major waterway that feeds into the ocean.\nTargus is doing just that with its new 15-16\" Coastline EcoSmart Collection. Good on the inside and out, these stylish, eco-friendly bags feature outer material made from 900D polyester which is created from certified ocean-bound plastic and the internal lining from 140D Recycled PET. The backpack has the equivalent of 69 percent recycled content and 26 percent ocean-bound plastic, whereas the briefcase incorporates 70 percent recycled content and 24 percent ocean bound plastic content. Both laptop cases also feature a dedicated laptop compartment with sling protection using neoprene made from recycled materials, ergonomic shoulder straps and durable carry handles, luggage trolley pass-through strap, and Targus' industry-leading Lifetime Limited Warranty.\nLaunching in Q1 2024, the new Coastline Backpack is priced at $89.99 and the Coastline Briefcase at $69.99 SRP.\nWorkspace Insights at Your Fingertips\nAnother key innovation that Targus will have front and center at CES 2024 is its revolutionary MiraLogic\u00ae Workspace Intelligence System. This unique workspace intelligence system, which is also a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, combines both patented and patent-pending enterprise-grade hardware with proprietary cloud-based software, to provide\u00a0technical and management teams with full remote control and visibility over their\u00a0modular IT ecosystems across the enterprise. This allows organizations to efficiently analyze, control, and manage their workspace assets anywhere (e.g., power consumption, workspace utilization, and real-time occupancy) to increase employee productivity, reduce costs, and improve sustainability.\nMiraLogic's newly released software version offers three major enhancements: Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates without an attached host device allow IT teams to perform regular device updates from any location (patent pending). Proactive notifications immediately alert IT teams of potential issues or events. Lastly, Single Sign-On (SSO) makes logging into the system seamless for users. Attendees can stop by Targus' booth to see the new and improved MiraLogic in action.\nSwitch it Up\nAs a global leader in docking, Targus continues to introduce universal docking stations to keep its customers organized, connected, and productive at home, in the office, or on the go. This year at CES, Targus will have its exciting USB-C\u00ae Dual Host Hybrid Triple Video KVM Docking Station with Dual 100W Power on full display. This enterprise universal/hybrid docking station features built-in Dual Host with KVM-sharing capabilities to make it seamless and easy to connect and control two laptops and share up to three monitors and several peripherals between them while docked.\nWhether you're a software developer who needs to access two environments at once; a product team that needs to quickly collaborate on the spot; a network engineer who needs to access two systems; or even a remote worker who wants to keep their work and personal computer connected and within arm's reach, maximize your efficiency with this powerful docking station.\nDOCK750 is available now at Targus.com and participating retailers worldwide for $499.99.\nDiscover the Targus Alliance Advantage\nDon't miss Targus' lineup of alliance and gaming laptop bags and accessories at CES which will also be featured in Targus' Augmented Reality (AR) experience whereby attendees can try out a variety of different backpacks and see how they look.\nTargus is a trusted partner to leading global PC OEMs, known for its global design leadership and expertise, turnkey strategic support, and wide range of Alliance laptop cases and accessories.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The key highlight of these processors is their enhanced AI capabilities, marking a major advancement in desktop computing technology. AMD\u2019s focus on integrating AI into their Ryzen 8000G series demonstrates their commitment to pushing the boundaries of processor performance and efficiency.\nAnker CES 2024\nAnker is starting off CES 2024 with some exciting updates on the availability of its first Qi2 chargers and power banks. We first got a look at the lineup last fall, and now devices with the refreshed 15W magnetic charging tech are finally here. There\u2019s seven new debuts that all pack the recent Qi2 charging tech.\nAnker\u2019s new Qi2 chargers are finally here! We\u2019ve been waiting on them since back in August when the lineup was first teased alongside the refreshed Nano series that began shipping alongside the iPhone 15. Now it\u2019s finally ready to ship the other new gadgets, with seven new releases entering the MagGo collection.\nEach one of the new chargers arrives with Qi2 support. These are the first and only releases from the company to support the new standard, and are some of the very first releases in the market period to do so. What that actually means is that all of them support full 15W speeds with the same magnetic features as Apple\u2019s own first party MagSafe tech.\nBosch CES 2024\nBosch\u2019s presence at CES 2024 is marked by its innovative eye-tracking technologies for drivers. One notable CES 2024 announcement is a technology that detects driver fatigue and offers to prepare an espresso upon arrival at home using connected technology. Meanwhile, Bosch\u2019s other development is more complex, focusing on tracking the driver\u2019s gaze during the journey, representing a significant advancement in automotive safety technology\nHisense CES 2024\nHisense\u2019s contribution to CES 2024 announcements centers around its new TV lineup, emphasizing larger and brighter screens. Key products include a 98-inch flagship ULED X model and a 100-inch QLED TV, both anticipated to redefine affordability for large-screen TVs. This commitment to bigger, brighter displays is a significant trend in the event.\nJBL CES 2024\nJBL\u2019s presence at CES 2024 is marked by a significant announcement, maintaining its status as a leading audio brand. Key highlights from JBL include more cost-effective earbuds equipped with the brand\u2019s innovative Smart Charging Case. Another major advancement in JBL\u2019s CES 2024 announcements is the introduction of a new range of wireless speakers featuring replaceable rechargeable batteries \u2013 a much-needed development in the consumer electronics market. These replaceable batteries not only extend the product\u2019s lifespan but also reduce waste, as products no longer need to be discarded when the battery ceases to function efficiently.\nEmphasizing sustainability, JBL\u2019s latest releases at CES 2024 incorporate increased use of post-consumer recycled plastic and FSC-certified paper packaging. This move aligns JBL with other forward-thinking brands in the dynamic consumer electronics sector, striving to minimize environmental impact where possible.\nKia CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Kia unveiled an innovative approach to electric vehicles, with a focus on modularity. Their new EV vans feature not only a modular powertrain but also modular tops, offering various cabin configurations. However, details regarding pricing, specifications, and launch dates for this new fleet of commercial EVs remain unspecified.\nThe first model in line, the Kia PV5, is a three-row van with a futuristic design, expected to hit the roads in 2025 at an approximate price of $35,000. Kia also presented concepts for a larger version, the PV7, due in 2027, and a smaller vehicle, the PV1, resembling a Smart Car in size. Additionally, Kia\u2019s CES 2024 announcements included plans for a robotaxi version in 2028, with the possibility of vehicles built on this platform being available to regular consumers in the future.\nLG CES 2024\nLG Electronics, at CES 2024, is redefining the role of televisions in interior design. They unveiled what they claim to be the world\u2019s first wireless transparent OLED TV, the LG Signature OLED T. This innovative product combines a transparent 4K OLED screen with LG\u2019s proprietary wireless video and audio transmission technology, challenging the traditional perception of televisions as mere functional items and positioning them as aesthetic elements in home design.\nNvidia CES 2024\nNvidia\u2019s CES 2024 announcements marked a significant leap into artificial intelligence with the introduction of its GeForce RTX series, including the GeForce RTX 40 Super series of desktop graphics cards. Primarily aimed at enhancing gaming experiences, Nvidia announced that 14 titles would receive the RTX upgrade, including notable games like Horizon Forbidden West, Pax Dei, and Diablo IV. The RTX 4080 Super, starting at $999, represents Nvidia\u2019s commitment to combining high performance with the latest in AI technology for an immersive gaming experience.\nPanasonic CES 2024\nPanasonic\u2019s CES 2024 announcements include the unveiling of the new LUMIX S 100mm F2.8 MACRO (S-E100) lens, a significant addition to the LUMIX S Series. This lens, compatible with the L-Mount system standard, is designed for both accessibility and professional-grade performance. The S-E100 stands out as the world\u2019s smallest and lightest medium-telephoto fixed focal length macro lens, weighing approximately 298 grams.\nIt features a new optical design and a newly developed Dual Phase linear motor, offering high resolution, remarkable bokeh effects unique to macro lenses, and rapid focusing. Compact and lightweight, this lens is perfectly aligned with Panasonic\u2019s F/1.8 series, ensuring excellent mobility for outdoor and various other shooting scenarios, making it a noteworthy CES 2024 announcement from Panasonic.\nSamsung CES 2024\nSamsung Electronics has introduced an updated version of Ballie, its home robot, at CES 2024. About the size of a bowling ball, Ballie is equipped with a battery lasting two to three hours. It features a spatial lidar sensor for navigation, a 1080p projector with dual lenses for projecting movies, video calls, and even functioning as a second PC monitor. Beyond Ballie, Samsung\u2019s CES 2024 announcements include advancements in connected home technology. These include updates to its SmartThings home automation platform and a new \u201cmap view\u201d feature, providing users with an interactive home map complete with animated avatars of residents and pets, showcasing Samsung\u2019s vision for the future of smart home living.\nSennheiser CES 2024\nSennheiser, the renowned German audio brand, has made its mark at CES 2024 with the launch of three new audio accessories, each targeting a different segment of the market. These wearable audio products emphasize extended battery life and innovative features. Notably, the Momentum Sport includes technology for monitoring physical activities. The flagship Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless Earbuds receive an iterative update, maintaining a similar appearance to its predecessor but boasting improved internals, as claimed by the company. This line-up of audio accessories at CES 2024 demonstrates Sennheiser\u2019s commitment to innovation and catering to diverse consumer needs in the audio market.\nCES 2024 Innovation Awards: Everything you need to know\nSony CES 2024\nSony, in the concluding major press conference slot on Monday at CES 2024, showcased a diverse array of initiatives.

This collaboration envisions transforming the mobility space into a creativity space, demonstrating a unique fusion of technology and entertainment.\nOne of the most intriguing demonstrations of this vision was the integration of Fortnite into Sony\u2019s Afeela car, an example of how gaming and automotive technologies can intersect in innovative ways. The demonstration went a step further by showcasing the Afeela car being driven on stage using a PlayStation 5 controller, symbolizing the potential of cross-platform technological integration and interactive entertainment.\nFeatured image credit: CES\nRelated Posts\nNaz API breach concerns 71 million emails, says Have I been Pwned\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. S23 Ultra comparison\nSamsung closed Unpacked 2024 by teasing the upcoming Galaxy Ring\nGoogle reveals \u201cCircle to Search\u201d for Pixel and S24\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 series hits the spotlight\nFoamstars AI art usage confirmed by Square Enix\nLATEST ARTICLES\nNaz API breach concerns 71 million emails, says Have I been Pwned\nGalaxy S24 Ultra vs. S23 Ultra comparison\nSamsung closed Unpacked 2024 by teasing the upcoming Galaxy Ring\nGoogle reveals \u201cCircle to Search\u201d for Pixel and S24\nSamsung Galaxy AI features that will change everything\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 series hits the spotlight\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 DATACONOMY MEDIA GMBH, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nFollow Us"

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' New Valentine's Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button.

We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting.
