In addition to the development of new technologies from the ground-up by a world-class team to decentralize PCR diagnostics technology and make it available at the point-of-care and in at-home settings, it also required the new technology to be able to be commercialized at a price point that is relevant worldwide. Diagnostics, along with vaccines and therapeutics, are a vital tool in helping to combat illnesses like TB, which remains a significant problem in India and many other countries despite being a highly treatable disease.\"\nhttps://lnkd.in/g2VrhQ4i\n#pcrtesting #tuberculosis #stoptb #CODX\nCo-Diagnostics, Inc.
