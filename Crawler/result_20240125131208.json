        "raw_content": "Multiple Production Line Will be Put Into Production; Sodium-ion Batteries Will Welcome the Mass Production Stage\nEnergyTrend has learned that there have been recent developments in several pilot projects related to sodium-ion battery energy storage. These developments signify significant progress in the realms of new technology breakthroughs, production capacity, and applications for sodium-ion batteries.\nIn 2023, there have been notable shifts in key data concerning sodium-ion batteries, and this year is being widely recognized as a pivotal one for the industrialization of sodium-ion batteries in China. In terms of policy, various global policies are poised to support the diversified advancement of sodium-ion batteries, flow batteries, and other technological pathways. Presently, numerous domestic production lines are in the planning stages for implementation, with China taking a leading role in the mass production of materials and batteries.\nThe influx of major enterprises into this sector is expected to result in a rapid increase in the production capacity of sodium-ion batteries, ultimately leading to the gradual establishment of a robust industrial ecosystem. When it comes to the construction of production lines, China\u2019s sodium-ion battery capacity planning primarily involves companies such as Transimage, Natrium Energy, CATL, Zonergy, Azure, DFD, and Lifun.\nAmong these players, Transimage stands out as China\u2019s foremost sodium-ion battery producer. It is anticipated to establish an exclusive mass production line dedicated to sodium-ion batteries with a staggering capacity of 4.5GWh by the close of 2023, constituting a remarkable 33.3% of the nation's overall production capacity.\nNatrium Energy secures its position as the second-largest sodium-ion battery producer in the country. By the end of 2023, it is projected to inaugurate a specialized mass production line for sodium-ion batteries boasting a capacity of 2.5GWh, representing a substantial 18.5% of the total production capacity.\nCATL, ranking as the third largest sodium-ion battery producer in China, is poised to unveil its dedicated mass production line for sodium-ion batteries with a capacity of 1.8GWh by the conclusion of 2023, contributing significantly with 13.3% of the nation's total production capacity. Considering the progress in commercialization, it\u2019s evident that the sodium-ion battery industry chain is currently in its introductory phase. The technologies related to battery materials and electrolytes are at an early developmental stage, implying that it will require some time for the sodium-ion battery industry to attain full commercial viability.\nIn the realm of sodium-ion battery production and manufacturing enterprises, two distinct development models have emerged. One involves traditional lithium battery manufacturers like CATL and Great Power diversifying into sodium-ion battery production. The other model consists of innovative enterprises, such as Hina Battery, Natrium Energy, and Transimage, which have started from scratch to establish themselves in this field. Among these enterprises, namely Transimage, Hina Battery, DFD, PRET, Vision Group, EAST, Highstar, and ZOOLNASM, they have all disclosed their production capacity plans. Currently, most of these enterprises are in the planning or construction phases for the investment and development of mass production lines for sodium-ion batteries.\nAs a valuable complement to lithium batteries, sodium-ion battery technology has steadily advanced in recent years. With its cost-effectiveness and the abundance of sodium resources, sodium-ion batteries hold great promise in the realm of energy storage. They can serve as reliable backup power sources for large-scale energy storage systems.\nMuch like lithium-ion batteries, the primary raw materials for sodium-ion battery production encompass four key components: anode materials, cathode materials, electrolytes, and separators. Additionally, key supplementary materials such as terminals, collectors, binders, conductive agents, and casing components play pivotal roles. Fortunately, the primary production and preparation techniques for sodium-ion batteries have reached a level of maturity.\nIn terms of anode materials, extensive research has been dedicated to layered oxides, polyanionic materials, and Prussian blue (white), among others. Concerning cathode materials, the predominant technical approach currently centers on hard carbon, with some reliance on soft carbon. Sodium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte holds a central position in the realm of electrolytes, and there is a growing trend towards adopting low-cost aluminum foil in place of copper foil as the collector material. Diaphragm materials can follow the established system utilized in lithium batteries.\nNumerous provincial policies are geared towards stimulating the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries, and the burgeoning demand for new energy storage is propelling the rapid growth of this technology. It\u2019s imperative for enterprises to proactively establish their presence, as this enables them to gauge the market\u2019s appetite for sodium-ion battery products within the burgeoning new energy and energy storage sector. This strategic move positions them favorably to capitalize on the surging opportunities in the flourishing sodium battery and energy storage industry.\nPost navigation\nAnticipating a Surge: Global New Installations in 2024 Projected to Reach 71GW/167GWh, Marking a Robust Year-on-Year Growth of 36% and 43%\npublished: 2023-12-18 17:27\n|\u00a0 tags: energy storage\nAnalyzing Market Dynamics in Energy Storage Giants - China, the United States, and Europe\npublished: 2023-12-15 16:33\n|\u00a0 tags: energy storage\n2024 PV Technology Forecast: Focusing on Breakthroughs Over Competition; Rectangle Wafers Contribute to Efficiency Gains and 210R Standardized Module Sizes\npublished: 2023-12-13 16:35\n|\u00a0 tags: solar PV\nModule Prices Experience Universal Decline Amidst Stable Pricing in Other Segments\nPolysilicon\uff1a\nPolysilicon prices\u00a0have\u00a0been stable\u00a0throughout the week.

        "raw_content": "Another sodium-ion battery factory is in the making in China for Zoolnasm\nAfter BYD and Huaihai confirmed plans this week, another company is building a large factory to produce sodium-ion batteries in China. Zoolnasm, a startup founded in January 2021, has already started construction.\nThe factory in Guangde in Anhui province is designed for an annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours for sodium-ion battery cells and a further 10 GWh for corresponding battery systems.\nThe first construction phase will be completed in August 2024 with an annual capacity of 10 GWh for Na-ion battery cells. Zoolnasm, also known as Zhong Na Energy, has yet to disclose a timeline for phase 2.\nThe company earmarked 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) to build on an area of 600 acres with access to the mighty Yangtze river. The first phase will cost 4 billion yuan with money likely coming through Zoolnasm\u2019s principal investor, Country Garden Venture Capital, the capital arm of real estate giant Country Garden.\nZoolnasm was founded in January 2021 with headquarters in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, east China. The company\u2019s head scientist, Zhao Jianqing, claims fifteen years of research in sodium-ion batteries (SIB). According to the website, Zoolnasm has developed three SIB cathode material preparation technologies, and an unnamed third party has tested its soft-pack battery samples.\nFounder Xia Gang said at the groundbreaking ceremony that since its establishment, Zhongna Energy has always adhered to the \u201caccumulation of full-stack technical capabilities\u201d and \u201cbuilding of full-chain mass production capabilities\u201d. It has now completed the construction and integration of technology, team and organisational capabilities and has taken the lead in realizing the company\u2019s products in the market.\nIncidentally, also in Jiangsu province but in Suzhou, BYD this week signed a contract with Huaihai to build an SIB plant in China with a capacity of 30 GWh. The budget is also the same budget at ten billion yuan (nearly $195 mn). The aim is to create the \u201cworld\u2019s largest supplier of sodium battery systems for small vehicles\u201d, but the partners have yet to set a timeline or start construction.\nStill, different from Zoolnasm, BYD already has a model in mind. Their entry segment EV, Seagull, will eventually come in two versions: a 38 kWh battery with LFP and a 30 kWh version with SIBs. The LFP battery variant is already selling at 78,800 yuan (\u20ac10,500).\nSodium-ion batteries are one of the few alternatives to Lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology, as these forego the potential scarcity and price of Lithium. Even though SIBs have lower energy density than LIBs, sodium-ion batteries can exhibit lower cell cost in USD/kWh, particularly in times of higher Lithium prices. (Note that Chinese manufacturers with better access to resources in a China-dominated market have also seen the price of lithium fall, which could affect SIB\u2019s competitiveness in future.) We evaluated the technology\u2019s advantages, disadvantages, and potential in a\u00a0special report\u00a0last spring.\nLastly, battery giant CATL also wants to move into SIB production from this year onwards. However, this is not about microcars and other light electric vehicles \u2013 CATL\u2019s sodium-ion cells will power Chery\u2019s iCar brand, expected this year.\nWhat is more, Europe\u2019s main battery hope, Northvolt just announced also looking into sodium-ion battery technology \u2013 but primarily in battery energy storage.\ncnevpost.com, zoolnasm.com (in Chinese)\nTags\n0 Comments\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

The investment into the project is 10 billion yuan (USD 1.4 billion), and the planned annual output capacity is 30 GWh.\nThe sod-cutting ceremony was held on January 4 in Xuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, with representatives of all parties celebrating the first day of project construction, the local government announced today.\nBYD\u2019s subsidiary Findreams Battery signed an agreement with tricycle giant Huaihai Group to construct the Xuzhou sodium battery plant on November 18 in Shenzhen. Companies announced they would make Xuzhou the center of battery production for micro vehicles and scooters as those EVs will have the best use of sodium-ion packs.\nThis is not the first cooperation between BYD and Huaihai Group, as both companies teamed up to build a\u00a0standard\u00a0battery plant in November 2022, also in Xuzhou. This plant will produce Blade batteries with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. Both companies jointly invested 10 billion yuan. In January last year, the construction started, and the 310,000 square meters factory is nearly ready, with trial production to begin in March 2024.\nBYD Seagull was\u00a0rumored\u00a0to be the first mass-produced EV with a Na+ battery. However, when it was launched in April, it came with a standard LFP Blade battery from BYD. The company hasn\u2019t commented on it since then.\nCompetitors\nOn December 27, the first mass-produced EV equipped with a sodium-ion battery rolled off the production line in China. It was a Volkswagen-backed JAC Yiwei hatchback using a sodium pack from HiNa Battery, and the deliveries will start later this month, according to HiNa.\nOn December 28, Ford\u2019s joint venture partner Jiangling Motors (JMC) started mass production of another EV powered by sodium-ion battery. the car is called JMEV EV3, and the Na+ battery is supplied by Farasis Energy.\nFarasis Energy says its Na+ batteries have an energy density of 140 \u2013 160 Wh/kg, and in 2024, it will launch a new generation with a density of 160 \u2013 180 Wh/kg. By 2026, they will produce sodium packs with 180 \u2013 200 Wh/kg density, according to the company.\nOther Chinese manufacturers are also not sleeping.\u00a0CATL announced in April\u00a0the first automaker to use its Na-ion batteries will be Chery Auto\u2019s iCar brand. However, no progress since then has been announced. It has 251 km of CLTC range thanks to a 21.4 kWh sodium-ion battery and a price of 58,800 yuan (USD 8,200).\nSodium-ion advantages\n\u201cSalt\u201d batteries are generally cheaper and do not use lithium as sodium will replace it as cathode material. It also doesn\u2019t need other precious metals, such as cobalt or nickel, like ternary NMC batteries. However, they have a lower energy density, thus being destined for use mainly in scooters, small cars, or stationary storage.\nLet\u2019s sum up sodium-ion pros and cons:\nPros:\nCons:\nVolkswagen-backed JAC Yiwei EV powered by sodium-ion battery starts mass production in China\nRecommended For You\n- Advertisement -\nNew Chinese EVs marketplace with the lowest prices & worldwide shipping.\nWe\u2019ll send you a weekly summary in your e-mail.

Sign-in with:\nMake Way for Sodium: World\u2019s Largest Sodium-ion Battery Production Facility Is on the Map\nThe world\u2019s largest 1-gigawatt-hour sodium-ion battery production line goes live in China.\nIn recent news, the power company China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG), along with industry and government partners, launched the world's first gigawatt-hour (GWh)-class sodium-ion battery (SiB) production line in Fuyang city, China.\nSodium vs. Lithium\nSiBs are a type of rechargeable battery that uses an aqueous sodium-ion electrolyte. These batteries have some advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages:\nSiBs can be used in any application that requires a high-power density\nThey are capable of storing more energy per unit weight than other battery types\nThey are considered to be more cost-effective than other battery types, such as lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries\nThey can be recharged a greater number of times than Li-ion batteries and last up to 10 years\nThey are non-flammable and considered a more safe alternative to Li-ion batteries\nDisadvantages:\nSIBs have a lower voltage than Li-ion batteries\nThey only work at low temperatures\nAs a natural resource, sodium is the sixth most common element within the Earth\u2019s crust. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, sodium makes up around 2.6 percent of the Earth\u2019s crust.\nAccording to HiNa Technology Co., Ltd. (HiNa Battery), the amount of lithium in the Earth\u2019s crust is much less at 0.0065 percent.\nSiBs could address the current need for a better, more efficient battery that can store more energy and have a longer life cycle.\nThe SiB Production Facility\nHiNa Battery is a company with headquarters based in Liyang (Jiangsu, China) that develops and manufactures SiBs used within next-generation energy storage systems. Areas of application for such batteries include electric motorcycles, bicycles, vehicles, industrial energy storage, and home energy storage.\nIn December 2021, HiNa Battery began its partnership with two of CTG\u2019s subsidiary companies and the Fuyang city government to jointly construct the 1-GWh SiB production facility. An initial capacity of 1 GWh is a part of the facility\u2019s first development phase, which was completed in July 2022.\nNext year, the production line is planned to undergo expansion to achieve a capacity of 3 to 5 GWh.\nHiNa Battery\u2019s Si Cells\nHiNa Battery\u2019s Na-ion cells feature an energy density of 145 Wh/kg energy density and are capable of 4,500 full charge-discharge cycles. The company is undertaking research and development (R&D) to develop the second generation of its Si cell technology. This new technology will be able to deliver an energy density of 200 Wh/kg energy density. This could result in batteries that last twice as long.\nThe globally recognized Li-ion batteries developer, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL), also plans to expand the production of SiBs soon, though with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg. The company has hinted that their next-generation cells will have an even higher energy density than the 200 Wh/kg baseline.\nRelated Content\nLearn More About:\nYou May Also Like\nby Barbara Vergetis Lundin\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Jake Hertz\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nWelcome Back\nDon't have an EEPower account?

        "raw_content": "language\n(Yicai Global) July 4 -- GEM, one of China\u2019s biggest suppliers of battery raw materials, has won a deal to provide Chinese sodium battery startup Shenzhen Paragonage with sodium-ion cathode materials in its first foray into this emerging market.\nShenzhen Paragonage is expected to buy between 10,000 metric tons and 15,000 metric tons of sodium-ion battery cathode materials a year from now until the end of 2025, GEM said yesterday, citing the deal signed by the two parties. Shenzhen Paragonage will be given priority for these materials among its customers.\nGEM, though, did not state how much sodium battery materials it currently produces and, according to its 2022 annual report, the Shenzhen-based firm has only recently completed pilot experiments and has not yet started mass production.\nGEM, though, is an investor in Shenzhen Paragonage, which secured an angel round of financing amounting to tens of millions of Chinese yuan, equivalent to millions of US dollars, last month, 36Kr reported at the time.\nSodium batteries, which replace lithium with cheaper sodium, are not ready to take over the world of electric vehicles until the value chain improves, according to a report released by the China Passenger Car Association and Kerui Consulting in May. As the price of lithium falls this year, sodium's price advantage is waning. Sodium, though, performs better in low temperatures and is safer so it could replace lithium under certain scenarios, it added.\nThe two firms will sign a purchase and sale agreement and a raw material processing contract later to specify the actual purchase quantity, GEM said.\nGEM will also develop new sodium battery cathode materials based on Shenzhen Paragonage\u2019s needs, and they will work together to advance technological innovation in and the industrialization of the sodium power industry, it said.\nThe two parties intend to explore technological development and strategic cooperation in sodium battery recycling, so as to bridge the gap in the reuse of sodium batteries, it added.\nUnaffected by the news, GEM\u2019s share price [SHE:002340] closed up 1 percent at CNY7.02 (USD0.97) today.\nEditor: Kim Taylor\nRELATED\nLog in to Yicai Global\nCreate your account\nWe sent you a code\nYou'll need a password\nFind your Yicai Global account\nCheck your email\nChange your password\nReset your password"
