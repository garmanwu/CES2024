        "raw_content": "Kyocera SLD Laser pumps up the Li-Fi speed\nThe LED industry has had a tough\ntime establishing its wares for Li-Fi \u2014\na Wi-Fi alternative that uses light rather than radio frequencies to transmit. Now, things just\ngot more challenging, as a major vendor from the laser industry demonstrated a\nsystem that transmits 100 times faster than any LED demo.\nKyocera SLD Laser (KSLD) showed a\nlaser Li-Fi system at the recent CES exhibition in Las Vegas in which a\ntransmitter delivered data at 100 gigabits per second. That trounces the 1 Gbps\nthat LED Li-Fi pioneer pureLiFi has shown.\nWhile that\u2019s potentially good news\nin general for Li-Fi, it could help hasten the end of the LED approach.\nBefore getting too carried away, we\nshould note that the KSLD system transmitted only over a short distance of\nabout a meter-and-a-half. And it utilized a boxy contraption (see photo) rather\nthan any sleekly designed finished product. Miniaturization of a 100-Gbps\nproduct is still a few years away, although KSLD over the last year started\noffering a finished product at somewhere between 1 and 2 Gbps, which it makes\navailable to systems developers for applications such as onboard Li-Fi on\nplanes and for vehicle communications.\nBy comparison, LED Li-Fi providers\nsuch as Edinburgh-based pureLiFi and Signify have been offering commercial\nproducts for several years, and they are small enough to serve laptops, tablets,\nand phones. Earlier this week LEDs Magazine reported on a\nrecent Signify installation at a Long Island school. In December, the\nUS Army re-upped with pureLiFi.\nBut Li-Fi, which dates back to at\nleast 2012 when then University of Edinburgh professor Harald Haas co-founded\npureLiFi, has endured slow commercial progress. Vendors are indeed selling\nproduct but typically into small settings. Mass adoption has eluded them, in\nlarge measure because most gadget makers have not embedded Li-Fi circuits.\nLi-Fi end users generally have to attach inconvenient dongles.\nAnd while Li-Fi offers various\npotential advantages over Wi-Fi, it does not, in its LED form, clearly trump\nWi-Fi on speed. Li-Fi can be faster than Wi-Fi but is not always. pureLiFi has\ndemonstrated a gigabit per second under controlled conditions, but real-world\ninstallations typically run slower. The Long Island school in Signify\u2019s orbit\nis believed to have installed a 150-Mbps-rated system; real running times would\nprobably be slower.\nThat is the primary reason why some\nexperts believe that LEDs will give way to lasers and their superior speed as\nthe future of Li-Fi, especially as developers like KSLD begin to miniaturize\ntheir products.\nLaser enthusiasts include none other\nthan the Nobel-winning\nco-inventor of the blue LED Shuji Nakamura, who co-founded Santa\nBarbara-based SLD Laser. Japan\u2019s Kyocera\nacquired SLD a year ago, creating KSLD, the company that showed the\n100-Gbps laser system at CES.\nNakamura is not the only LED legend\nnow identified with laser Li-Fi. The same might be said of Haas, widely\nregarded as the father of Li-Fi for his pioneering work with LED-based Li-Fi.\nWhile still serving as chief scientific officer for pureLiFi, he\nis now also a senior advisor to KSLD, helping the company with laser Li-Fi\ndevelopment.\nHaas works in that capacity not with\nhis pureLiFi hat on but via academia. The professor changed universities in\nJuly 2020, departing Edinburgh to become distinguished professor of mobile\ncommunications at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where he is also\nthe director of the LiFi Research and Development Centre.\nHaas has long had an eye for laser\ncommunications. In fact, pureLiFi itself acknowledged to LEDs Magazine last\nsummer that \u201claser\nlight will better serve Li-Fi\u201d. It has developed a laser Li-Fi chip\ndesigned as an antenna for embedding in phones and for use as a transmitter.\nKSLD and pureLiFi have not announced\nany partnership.\nThe 100 Gbps that KSLD showed at CES\nis five times the speed of its previous fastest demonstration of 20 Gbps.\nIt could well be that the future has\na place for Li-Fi. It\u2019s just that the \u201clight emitting diodes\u201d that drive it\nforward could be lasers, rather than what the industry calls LEDs.\nLEDs\nMagazine recently interviewed both\nHaas and KSLD senior vice president `of business development Paul Rudy, a\nco-founder of SLD. We will bring you more on this story, including a look at\nhow the CES demo worked, the possible applications for the KSLD Li-Fi\ntechnology (spoiler: think avionics, for one), and a look at whether the\ntechnology will also be used for illumination (spoiler: yes and no).\nMARK HALPER\u00a0\u00a0is a contributing editor for LEDs Magazine, and an energy, technology, and business journalist ([email\u00a0protected]).\nFor up-to-the-minute LED and SSL updates, why not\u00a0follow us on Twitter?

(KSLD), a world leader in commercialization of laser light sources, has announced the introduction of the world\u2019s first LaserLightTM engines that deliver dynamic white and infrared (IR) night vision illumination along with sensing and LiFi communication functionality for automotive and consumer applications. The company will demonstrate its award winning products, new LaserLight engines, and recent innovations in optical power transfer and lighting disinfection at the Consumer Electronics Show January 5 \u2013 8, 2022.\nFollowing KSLD\u2019s highly successful white LaserLight product launch into automotive headlights in 2019, the company is now introducing LaserLight engines that feature dual white/IR emission to fuse multiple critical functionalities including dynamic white lighting and infrared night vision illumination that can be combined with sensing and LiFi communications. The high brightness collimated white light provides 1 km beam distance while independently delivering IR illumination for night vision cameras to enable maximum machine vision visibility and safety. White/IR dual emission sources are critical for all mobility applications including automotive, avionics, drones, railway, and marine. In the consumer and professional product space, the dual emission sources will find application in portable lighting products, night vision illuminators, and rangefinders for recreation and outdoor, search & rescue, and security applications. Until now, dual emission white/IR sources have not been possible because LEDs and legacy lamp-based light sources are unable to deliver high brightness white and IR emission from the same point source, and they are incapable of being modulated at the high speeds required for accurate sensing and fast data rates.\nThe illumination pattern of KSLD\u2019s LaserLight engines can be electronically adjusted on-demand for efficient and high precision dynamic beam shaping. In sensing and imaging, the fast temporal response of KSLD\u2019s LaserLight enables high-resolution ranging at distances over 250 meters for automotive ADAS systems as well as consumer rangefinding applications. Beyond single-point depth sensing, the LaserLight engines can be combined with imaging sensors to facilitate full 3D LiDAR systems. To support the future of wireless connectivity, the LaserLight engines deliver high-speed, secure, efficient, RF-free LiFi communication with data rates exceeding 1 gigabit per second for mobility applications including car-to-x exterior, vehicle interiors, airplane cabins, as well as future smart cities, healthcare, secure facilities, and smart factories. By providing both white and IR from the same source and combining dynamic lighting, accurate sensing, and high speed communication, KSLD\u2019s LaserLight engines enable customers to commercialize potent intelligent illumination systems. These LaserLight engines can be configured for customer specific applications and have exciting potential to be performance optimized using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nBeyond lighting, sensing, and communication, KSLD will demonstrate the world\u2019s first optical power transmission over fiber using its innovative, high efficiency GaN laser and photocell semiconductor chip technology at CES 2022.

(KSLD) announced the production launch of the world\u2019s first dual-emission white light and infrared (IR) LaserLight source for automotive and consumer lighting, night vision illumination, precision long-range sensing beyond 250 m (820 ft), and high-speed light fidelity (LiFi) communications faster than 20 Gbps. Acquired by Kyocera Corp. and now operating as a Kyocera group company, the California company formerly known as SLD Laser and co-founded by James Raring, President and CEO, and Paul Rudy, SVP BD and CMO, is focused on the commercialization of gallium nitride (GaN) based laser light sources.\nThe company says that white/IR dual emission sources are critical for automotive lighting, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and autonomous vehicle LiDAR 3D sensing, as well as mobility applications including avionics, drones, railway, and marine. Additionally, dual emission sources are required for consumer and professional portable lighting products, night vision illuminators, and rangefinders for recreation and outdoor, search and rescue, and security applications.\nThe new source delivers high brightness white light with 1-km (0.6-mi) beam distance, while independently producing IR illumination from the same emission spot to achieve ranging to more than 250 m with 1% accuracy. Moreover, these sources generate LiDAR video imagery and data when integrated with sensor chips to enable next-generation 3D imaging headlights.\nKSLD says its new LaserLight dual white/IR sources deliver high brightness, safe, incoherent white light of 500 lumens with near-infrared emission up to 1 W average power and 100 W peak power that can emit either together simultaneously or independently, depending on the needs of the application. The white/IR LaserLight source technology is available in several high-volume product configurations including a MicroSpot module, FiberLight module, and SMD (surface mount device) component.\nUntil now, high-speed, dual-emission white/IR sources have not been possible because LEDs and legacy lamp-based light sources are unable to deliver high-brightness, dual-wavelength emission from the same point source, and they are incapable of being modulated at the high speeds required for accurate sensing and fast data rates.\nUsing the white/IR dual-emission LaserLight sources, KSLD now offers a commercial LiFi development kit with a 1-Gbps data rate for customers to design LiFi into emerging optical communication applications for a myriad of mobility use cases, as well as future smart cities, such as intelligent streetlights, and smart buildings, such as healthcare facilities and factories.\nBy delivering both white and IR from the same source and fusing together lighting, sensing, and communication functionalities, KSLD\u2019s LaserLight LiFi kit enables its customers to commercialize potent intelligent illumination systems. These systems provide a combination of precision white lighting, accurate sensing, and ultra-high-speed communication with unconstrained optical bandwidth, as well as secure and efficient data transmission without RF interference of the incumbent WiFi technology.\nKSLD\u2019s high-brightness white light LaserLight products were showcased at its virtual CES 2021 exhibit. The company says its automotive certified LaserLight Fiber sources are now deployed into multiple vehicle platform headlights and are on the road globally. KSLD has been named a Grade A supplier for excellent quality by a leading global Tier 1 supplier. KSLD\u2019s white light sources were also used by the winning drivers at the 2020 SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race.\nGary Mason contributed this article to Futurride.

        "raw_content": "KYOCERA SLD Laser Showcases High Power Blue Laser Diode Product Line at SPIE Photonics West 2023\nhttps://cdn.gophotonics.com/news/cover_638109968826399200.png712370\nKYOCERA SLD Laser, a world leader in commercialization of laser light sources, unveiled its new high power 5 watt blue laser diode products for industrial, biomedical, defense and display applications at the SPIE Photonics West Exhibition. The company showcased this new product line along with its new high brightness White / IR LaserLightTM SMD products, winner of the 2021 Prism Award. Additionally, KSLD demonstrated its DataLightTM high speed LiFi communication system, a 2023 Prism Award finalist, as well as its new innovations in high efficiency laser diodes for AR/VR applications and efficient optical power transfer technology.\nKSLD\u2019s new high power blue laser diode products deliver 5 watts of optical power at 445 nm and are based on KSLD\u2019s proprietary high gain semipolar GaN architecture. The product is available in a TO-can package or chip-on-submount, as well as a fiber delivered configuration. The devices are ideally suited for integration into customer end systems in industrial marking, engraving for non-metals and organics such as resins, plastics, and printed circuit boards as well as in 3D printing and welding of metals such as copper for EV battery production where absorption is more than 10 times higher than for infrared lasers.\nHigh power blue lasers also have broad range of use in biomedical applications including dental, surgical, and dermatology where absorptions in hemoglobin and melanin are more than 5 times that of infrared lasers, as well as defense applications including avionics LiDARs and undersea communications. Additionally, high power blue laser diodes are used in projection displays to excite RGB phosphors to replace lamps in portable projectors, home theater, boardroom and education projectors, as well as large venue and cinema. KSLD is also applying its high gain Semipolar GaN innovation to develop high efficiency low power red, green, and blue laser diodes to miniaturize, brighten, and reduce power consumption of RGB laser beam scanning modules for the emerging AR/VR market.\nKSLD also showcased its LaserLightTM SMD devices that deliver high brightness white and infrared (IR) dual illumination for medical, machine vision, inspection, safety lighting, bioinstrumentation and other applications that require high intensity spots or high efficiency fiberoptic delivery of white light. The company features expanded IR wavelengths from 850 nm to 1000 nm, and increased white light up to 1000 lumens to deliver high brightness, high visibility, eye-safe illumination. Mobility applications include automotive, avionics, drones, railway, and marine white light and IR night vision, range finding and flash LiDAR. Specialty lighting applications include portable flashlights and light bars, high lumen spotlights for avionics, helicopter search & rescue and security applications, as well as entertainment and outdoor lighting. Until now, dual emission white/IR sources have not been possible because LEDs and legacy lamp-based light sources are unable to deliver high brightness white and IR emission from the same point source, and they are incapable of being modulated at the high speeds required for accurate sensing and fast data rates.\nTo support the future of wireless connectivity, KSLD displayed DataLightTM, the world\u2019s first laser LiFi commercial development kit featuring a high-speed 1 Gbps, secure, RF-free, eye-safe bidirectional link. Laser LiFi is being adopted in mobility applications including car-to-x exterior, vehicle interiors, airplane cabins, undersea and space, defense and security, as well as future smart cities, healthcare, and smart factories. KSLD is pioneering LiFi innovations for future products as well and recently demonstrated world record performance of 100 Gbps. This product is a finalist for the 2023 Prism awards in the Laser category.\nBeyond lighting, sensing, and communication, KSLD demonstrated its innovative optical power transmission over fiber using its high efficiency GaN laser diode and photodiode semiconductor chip technology. This significant advancement in the field of power transfer has the potential to replace heavy and sensitive metal wire harnesses in mobility and harsh-environment applications with a lightweight, noise-free optical solution, increasing the efficiency and extending the range of electric vehicles, airplanes, or satellites, while making them more secure and safe. This power-over-light solution can be configured to include optical data communications to deliver data and power to sensors in a distributed system in a vehicle or even in space, where radiation hardened GaN based semiconductors are ideally suited.\nClick here to learn more about KYOCERA SLD's LaserLight engines.\nLike\nthis Story?

        "raw_content": "The Definitive Voice of Entertainment News\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nsite categories\nJenna Ortega\u2019s Emmy Red Carpet Look Generated $5.6 Million in Media Exposure for Dior at the Emmys\nThe Definitive Voice of Entertainment News\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nCES 2024: The Best TVs and Projectors Coming Soon from Samsung, LG, TCL and More\nFrom Hisense's CanvasTV designed to compete with the popular Frame, to LG's stunning OLED transparent screen and an UST triple laser projector designed for small spaces, here are our top picks.\nCES 2024 took place in Las Vegas from Jan. 8-12, and The Hollywood Reporter\u2018s shopping editors and product reviewers were on the ground scouting the best new products in consumer tech from over 4,000 exhibitors. From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nPeak Chic: Balenciaga's $5,600 Snowboard Leads a Flurry of Luxury Skiwear and Accessories\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM's New Campaign\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nJenna Ortega\u2019s Emmy Red Carpet Look Generated $5.6 Million in Media Exposure for Dior at the Emmys\nHow to Watch NCAA Women\u2019s College Basketball on TV (and Where to Find a Livestream Online)\nA New \u2018Barbie\u2019 Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie\u2019s Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nHow to Stream \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season 28 Online Without Cable\nOmega Fetes Andrew Garfield With Dinner During Paris\u00a0Men\u2019s Fashion Week\nOne of the Best 4K Projector TVs Is On Sale Ahead of Your Super Bowl Viewing Party\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nH-Town Shares Music Video For \"Strokey Doke\" Starring Drea Kelly\nYou may also like\nThe Best Medicine Balls, According to Fitness Trainers\nFord\u2019s New Mach-E Mustang Bronze Is Its Fastest Electric Model Yet\nGeorge Clinton Reflects On Walk Of Fame Star: \u201cThis Feels Good As\u00a0Sh*t\u201d\nSubscriber Support\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nLegal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nHave a Tip?\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nOur Sites\nNews\nExpand news menu\nFilm\nExpand film menu\nTV\nExpand tv menu\nAwards\nExpand awards menu\nLifestyle\nExpand lifestyle menu\nBusiness\nExpand business menu\nMore Essentials\nExpand more-essentials menu\nFollow Us\nAlerts & Newsletters\noptional screen reader"
