        "raw_content": "HWCooling.net\nSearch\nDeepCool at CES 24: Panoramic case and dark liquid coolers\nDeepCool CH780 and LS720S/LS520S Zero Dark\nDeepCool has introduced a heavily glass-clad case with an atypical system fan layout (with an emphasis on negative pressure) and affordable liquid coolers. These will be attractive for users who do not like lighted elements and for whom the highest possible cooling efficiency or the most attractive price/performance ratio is paramount. DeepCool\u2019s new liquid CPU coolers have the prerequisites to score points in this respect.\nSkrinka CH780\nDeepCool kicked off its CES (2024) presence this year with the announcement of two new products. The first is the CH780 \u201cpanoramic\u201d case with a very good view of the components. In addition to the tempered glass side panels, the front panel is also clear. Within its design you won\u2019t find any fans or mounting positions for them. It is a flat glass panel without any perforations. The system fans are housed elsewhere. Namely, on a bracket that is oriented perpendicular to the front panel from the right side. These fans don\u2019t draw in cooler air from the outside, but act as exhaust fans to get the heated air out of the case.\nSince all three (140-millimeter, by the way) fans are oriented this way, the air circulation is characterized by negative pressure. Outside air is brought in through various joints along the case housing, e.g. from above or below. These are also where additional fans in 120 (6\u00d7), 140 (6\u00d7) or even 200 mm (4\u00d7) formats can be added as optional extras. There is no fan position on the rear panel and the layout of the case is a bit atypical overall.\nDeepCool refers to it as a dual chamber case, where the motherboard, processor, memory and graphics card are installed from the left. Then on the right is the power supply (ATX) and inch-type storage. The \u201cmain\u201d chamber is thus narrower, the CPU cooler should not be taller than 132 mm, and even the installation of a larger graphics card assumes vertical orientation. Length restrictions regarding the graphics card are practically non-existent in the DeepCool CH780 case. There are three mounting positions for liquid cooler radiators (ceiling, bottom, back panel) and all of them support large coolers up to 420 mm.\nThe front panel is also packed with connectors, with as many as five USB ports. Four are type A (3.2 gen. 1 standard) and one is type C (probably 3.2 gen. 2. We\u2019ll check and clarify). The 3.5mm audio jack is only one, shared, which is perhaps a pity. From the front panel, then, a dedicated button also makes it possible to change the lighting modes of the fans.\nThe manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price is 179.99 EUR (black version) or 189.99 EUR for those interested in a white case with the WH designation (CH780 WH).\nThe LS720S and LS520S Zero Dark coolers\nAlso new from DeepCool are liquid CPU coolers, the LS720S Zero Dark (with three fans on a 360mm radiator) and the one-third shorter LS520S model, the LS520S Zero Dark.\nThey use the 4th generation DeepCool pump combined with the latest (and most efficient?) microchannel design inside the copper block. The radiators are aluminum and overall there is a shot at getting the most favorable price/performance ratio. The FK120 fans don\u2019t use lighting and neither does the block housing (hence the Zero Dark), and the focus is on affordability. The LS720S Zero Dark should retail for no more than 104.99 EUR and the LS520S Zero Dark is about 15 EUR cheaper.\nBoth AMD (AM5 and AM4) and Intel (LGA 1700, LGA1200/LGA115x) platforms are supported, i.e. all current and some older ones.\nEnglish translation and edit by Jozef Dud\u00e1\u0161\nRelated articles\nA gaming cooler? DeepCool AK620 Zero Dark Zoria in details\nDeepCool has modified its successful AK620 Zero Dark cooler in line with the theme of Zoria: Age of Shattering. Thus, we can legitimately talk about a gaming cooler, as long as this designation refers to the visual design. It is literally a work of art, and one of the goals was to make sure that the cooling performance was not degraded in any way after this intervention. It was to remain at the level of the original design, so top-notch. Read more \u201cA gaming cooler? DeepCool AK620 Zero Dark Zoria in details\u201d \u00bb\nValkyrie Dragonfang 240. Smaller edition of the Cypriot liquid cooler\nAt the end of this year, I have prepared a review of Valkyrie\u2019s AIO liquid cooler. In the autumn I tested their flagship cooler Dragonfang 360 and today we will test its smaller brother, the Dragonfang 240. It is cheaper and has wider compatibility, as it is more compact. Valkyrie\u2019s previous coolers have not fared badly in absolute numbers at all, hopefully this trend will continue in today\u2019s article. Read more \u201cValkyrie Dragonfang 240.

You\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer for that one, although the planned release delay is quite small, but don\u2019t count on a January date. But it looks like the period in which these fans will be coming out will be a very fruitful one. In fact, the successor to the NH-D15 cooler is also said to come out in the same quarter. Read more \u201cLast delay of Noctua 140 mm LCP fans?\u201d \u00bb\nPost navigation\nOne comment\nAdd comment\nThe case has one of the best airflow/noise designs I have seen in this type of case. The side fans being exhaust by default make a lot of sense (both in terms of overall airflow and avoiding extra noises due to the intake side of the fans being put flush against the vents), plus the vents and fan mounts are much less obstructive than that of most competitors.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Take a look at the case mods, upcoming cooling and at the very bottom, enjoy shots being fired from the DeepBot-Alpha-01.\nCool Case Mods\nDeepCool was displaying a case done by LiquidHaus called Project Sentinel as well as collaboration units with METAPCs, StinceBuilt, Starforge, Gallery Panda and Xidax.\nCases\nDeepCool was rolling out its CH160 and CH360 series cases. The CH160 is a mini ITX form factor case that has a lot of room on the inside for modern GPUs. It sports a handle on the top so you easily carry it to your next LAN party.\nThe CH360 is a few hairs bigger, allowing a micro-ATX motherboard to fit in it along with ASUS\u2019s RTX 4090 Left Leg STRIX GPU which was standard issue to every single case maker at CES to demonstrate that it could fit (and play Crysis).\nAir Coolers\nOn the air cooler front, the Assassin 4S makes its debut as a slimmer version of the Assassin IV by dropping down to a single fan configuration.\nAIO Coolers\nDeepCool brought along the Mystique and Mystique Plus AIO coolers. The Mystique will be offered in 240mm and 360mm sizes and sport a 2.8 inch 640\u00d7480 resolution screen on the top of the pump. The Mystique Plus will one-up that by coming in 360mm and 420mm sizes featuring a 3.4 inch 480\u00d7480 resolution screen.\nThe coolers will utilize the new FT12 SE or FT14 SE fans which light up in the center.\nPew Pew\nDeepCool was also showing off a mod based on its Quadsteller case by the team at Apex Alpha Labs called DeepBot-Alpha-01. Its specs include a 12700KF, MSI B760m Mortar WiFi, 64 GB of Memory, 2TB of SSD Storage, a 1000W PSU and a DeepCool LS720 AIO Cooler. Beyond the PC, it also includes dual modified full-automatic x-shot chain driven dart guns (that are remote controlled). Allegedly it can fire 240 rounds per minute.\nWe got to see it in action \u2013 but watch quick as it\u2019s a short clip.\nJoin the discussion in our forums...\nTomb Raider Gains Path Tracing via Open Lara RTX: Reimagined Realms NVIDIA RTX Remix Mod\nASUS ROG Falchion RX Low Profile 65% Gaming Keyboard Features an Interactive Touch Panel\nUntil Dawn Will Be Announced for PS5 and PC Next Month: Report\nNew Intel Graphics Driver Delivers Up to 268% Average FPS Uplift for Select DirectX 11/12 Games\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER Benchmarks Suggest It\u2019s a Mild Upgrade over the Standard Model\nEmail address:"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 \u2013 DeepCool Shows Off New Coolers and Cases\nDeepCool has been killing it lately with their new coolers, and we were excited to check out their upcoming products here at CES 2024. Their meeting room was full of new hardware ranging from fans and heatsinks, to AIO coolers, cases and more. They even had a large build off to the side that was made to look like some sort of walking autonomous sentry, with dual rotating barrels that actually shot Nerf darts.\nMystique 240/360 AIO Coolers\nFirst up from DeepCool are the Mystique 240 and Mystique 360 AIOs. As you might have realized, these are 240mm and 360mm sized all-in-ones, but what their name doesn\u2019t imply is that they also come equipped with a 2.8\u2033 IPS screen on the pump housing with a resolution of 640 x 480, and 750 nits of brightness. All of the standard monitoring options are available, including temperature and system status, images, videos, and animations. A built-in gyroscope ensures the image on the screen is in the right orientation, which makes installing and configuring that much easier. Two (or three) FT12 SE FBD PWM fans are included, and DeepCool has also made improvements to their 4th generation pump design to increase cooling performance. We don\u2019t have pricing for the 240mm version, but we should see the Mystique 360 in Q1 of 2024 for right around $169.\nMystique 420 Plus Cooler\nMoving up to a 420mm radiator size, the Mystique 420 not only offers more cooling capacity and performance for higher-wattage processors, it also provides a slightly larger LCD screen. At 3.4\u2033, this 480 x 480 resolution screen has 950 nits of brightness, and looked great showing full-motion video in DeepCool\u2019s display. 64GB of on-board storage is present on this cooler to allow for saving videos and more to the cooler itself, which is kind of a neat idea. DeepCool has again employed their FT series fans, but this time you will get three 140mm units to go along with the 420mm radiator. Although not set in stone, we should see the Mystique 420 come out sometime in Q2 of 2024, with a price of $179.\nAssassin 4S\nBuilding on to the original Assassin 4, the Assassin 4S is a slightly slimmer version, with just a single 140mm FDB fan squeezed in between the two heatsink towers. Seven heat pipes are present to move heat away from from the base of the cooler and up to the fins stack, which has the same patterned design that we have seen from DeepCool\u2019s recent heatsink coolers. A simple cover in the middle hides this fan, but can easily be popped of and the fan removed via tabs on each side of the fan. DeepCool will be offering the Assassin 4S in both black and white versions, with a small turquoise DC logo on the top of the cooler. No pricing in formation just yet, but expect this cooler in Q1 of 2024.\nCH160 & CH160 Digital Cases\nThe CH160 from DeepCool is a mITX case with plenty of airflow to keep modern CPUs and GPUs cool, and provides room for air coolers up to 172mm in height, including their very own Assassin 4S. Three-slot GPUs up to 305mm in length will fit with no issues, and the tempered glass side panel is there to show it all off. A carrying handle has been built into the top of the case for easy transportation on the CH160, and this case should be available sometime in Q1.\nA variation of the CH160, the CH160 Digital features a similar design, but has been oriented in a vertical position. At the base of the CH160 Digital is an LCD-based display that is ready to show you system monitoring information of the system inside. The digital version of the case offers the same 172mm cooler height clearance, as well as room for 305mm GPUs. Again, no word on pricing, but we should see this case in Q1.\nCH360 & CH360 Digital Cases\nOn the larger side of things, we have the CH360 and CH360 Digital cases, both mATX enclosures. Both of these cases feature a mesh front panel and mesh lower portion of the side of the case. A tempered glass side panel lets you get a look inside the case to see the full sized heatsink and graphics card support. On the digital version of this case there is again a small digital display that can provide you instant information regarding system temperatures, utilization, and more. No word on pricing for either version, but expect to pay about a $20 premium for the digital version when they launch sometime in Q1.\nOur CES 2024 coverage is brought to you by Yeyian!\nYou May Also Like\nThinkComputers \u00a9 2024.
