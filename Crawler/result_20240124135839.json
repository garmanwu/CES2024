        "raw_content": "Living Farming Tree: the vertical and digitized vegetable garden that reconnects to nature\nAmong the international trends that tell the new post\nCovid-19\nlifestyles, the presence of green in indoor spaces is certainly the most long-lived and predominant.\nPlants but not only; shapes, textures, natural elements of all kinds if introduced in the design of spaces - as the\nbiophilic design\ndictates - contribute to improving air quality, mood, productivity. But also to\nreduce stress\nand help you to experience domestic environments, now hybrid, and also those purely working in a more comfortable way.\nAmong the innovative realities that make 'green living' and the circular economy the heart of their project there is\nHexagro,\nthe Milanese startup that is developing the first urban farming platform\nwith the vision of guaranteeing access to healthy, nutritious and sustainable food at km 0 to anyone, anywhere.\nWhen the company is born from a university thesis project\nThe startup\nHexagro\nwas born from the degree thesis of\nFelipe\nHernandez, founder and CEO, dedicated to\nregenerative agriculture\nand pesticide-free agricultural technologies. In 2015, Hexagro was awarded among the finalists of the\nBiomimicry Design Challenge\nand since 2016 it has started its activities in Milan.\nThe name is also the result of experimentation: 'Hexagro' derives from the combination of two words,\nhexagon\n- the distinctive shape of the startup's products - and\nagriculture. Moreover, the hexagon is the most efficient form in nature, compact and versatile, concepts that inspire\nHexagro\nto develop scalable, efficient, automated and sustainable vertical farming solutions.\nLiving green, with technology and design\nAdopting eco-sustainable lifestyles, without excluding a priori the technological contribution - but rather exploiting it in favor of a green approach - is possible.\nHexagro\nin fact\ncombines technology and biophilic design\nin order to make every environment the ideal place to grow food. It does so through internal and external\nvertical farming\nsystems, designed by the startup to reduce the traditional food chain and introduce the experience and lifestyle of urban agriculture in a horizontal way.\nThese are\nmodular indoor vertical gardens\n- in shape and finishes - and\nscalable, inspired by the principles of biophilic design and well contextualized in any indoor environment.\nbiophilic design\nwas born to bring a new way of designing and thinking about the places where we live, work and are educated, in order to reconnect people to the natural world through the use of materials and architectural elements that recall nature through the five senses.\nThe advantages are obvious: they increase cognitive abilities, creativity and work performance, as well as happiness and mood.\nFollowing the model of nature\ncan be of great benefit to everyone: this method of innovation is it calls biomimicry. It is, in essence, an innovative method in which the first step is to understand how nature has already developed similar solutions and apply them in other fields.\nThe\nLiving Farming Tree\ntakes inspiration from the structure and efficiency of trees, thus creating a\nconfiguration with\n'branches' that it can grow in height and width exactly like a tree. The cultivation modules recall the\nhexagonal shape\nof the hive cells, and the soft lines of the latest design recall the natural shapes of trees, landscapes and natural conformations.\nHaving a\nLiving Farming Tree\nwhere you live or work is therefore a concentrate of nature in a small space, thanks also to the\nwood finishes\nand above all to the richness of\nfresh plants\nand fragrant grown inside.\nThe\nLiving Farming Trees\nare not unique only because of their design, but also because they are 'high tech' gardens: it looks like an oxymoron, yet it is a model that can be made thanks to\ntechnology\naeroponics, ie landless cultivation and reduced water consumption.\nAreoponics, a technology that is good for us and the environment\nThe vertical gardens designed by Hexagro\nminimize water consumption\n- a commodity that never before needs to be preserved and vintage - and\nfacilitate the absorption of nutrients\nby of cultivated plants. This therefore makes the finished product more efficient from the point of view of consumption, but above all much better on the taste and health side.\nIn\nLiving Farming Trees\nthe plants are placed in different modules placed at different heights - they are artificially suspended - and their roots absorb water and nutrients in the container below. Water and nutrients are in fact sprayed directly on the roots, which allows growth up to 3/5 times faster than traditional crops.\nThe water dosage and the intensity of the lights are controlled by the\nIoT\nsystem, making the system completely\nautomated\nand designed to optimize plant growth.\nThe automated management software monitors and controls each agricultural parameter of the garden remotely, through specific\nsensors\nconnected to the network.\nTo complete the experience, and therefore to integrate the 'playful' and fun part of the introduction of a technological vertical garden by Hexagro, there is also the app for\nsmartphone\nand tablet, which allows users to easily manage their crops, even remotely.\nCommunity and sustainability\nThanks to the\nnetwork\nof activated systems, Hexagro is creating a real\ncommunity of users and partners\nwho share the same vision for a sustainable food system and resilient.\nThe unique experience created by the\nLiving Farming Tree\nimproves wellbeing by ensuring access to healthy and fresh food and encouraging interactions between people.\nThe\nconnection\nwith plants, combined with the availability of fresh food and the discovery of new technologies and flavors, facilitates the creation of a healthy environment and reconnects people to nature, food and others.\nOne of Hexagro's missions, which aims to\nfacilitate a more streamlined and simplified approach to urban and km0 agriculture, making it easy and accessible, is also to collect data and information on plants, on the people who approach this lifestyle and on the places, to provide users with an increasingly engaging urban farming experience.\nAll the technologies and know-how developed by Hexagro and the community are used to\npromote social projects and support urban communities\nall over the world, in contexts where the consequences of global warming , land degradation and urbanization are affecting farmers the most.\n\"Through our social projects we are able to close the circle of our sustainable impact\" explains\nAlessandro\nGrampa, co-founder of Hexagro. \"By bringing these technologies to developing countries, we are really moving to give access to healthy food to anyone, anywhere\".\nSeealso\nMiniature exhibitions, art dioramas and mini museums always open\nTextile upcycling: from soft to firm\nExperimental threads\nEarly Net Zero?\nFollow us"

Thanks to this approach we can impact the way consumers access fresh food by demand as they will be connected with local farmers using our systems. For example, they will distribute the initial seedlings to finish their growth cycle directly at the private customers site.\nThis network is a viral and exponential approach towards Urban Farming, in which everybody becomes a part of the food system.\nFilm your elevator pitch.\nWhat specific problem are you solving?\nThe global fresh food supply chain is at risk. Centralized food production models represent one of the biggest sources of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. If we consider the challenges of Global Warming whose effect on agriculture is deeply affecting productivity worldwide by almost 7.6% in 2017, many more people that are living in the countryside will look for new opportunities in urban areas.\n\u25cf Population growth: The UN estimates that farmers will need to produce at least 50% more food by 2050 because populations are growing, and incomes are rising.\u25cf Climate change: Changing weather conditions will have a major impact on food production, the most important agricultural regions may suffer declines in agricultural output due to climate-related changes.\u25cf Water access: Under current trends demand for water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030.\u25cf Food waste: The UN estimates that 1.3 B tons of food are lost or wasted annually, equating to roughly one-third of global food production, 45% of fruit and vegetables are wasted today.\u25cf Demand for food will only continue to increase in the future according to food experts. We need technologies to increase productivity and decrease the environmental impact of food production.\nWhat is your solution?\nHexagro's Urban Farming Platform increases the access to vertical farming technologies and locally produced healthy food. We offer hardware, software and service solutions for consumers, companies and producers to increase the adoption of this technology.\nConsumers: we developed Poty, a compact, modular and automated vertical garden sold to households with a subscription service for resources supply to provide everything people need to start growing without a green thumb.\nCompanies: we developed the Living Farming Tree, a modular, Iot-automated and stylish indoor garden (offered as-a-service) to create value for existing semi-public spaces in cities such as offices, hotels, commercial centers, etc. to increase wellness and provide an interactive experience for people to eat healthy vegetables locally.\nProducers: we developed Matu, a modular, aeroponic and low-cost vertical tower easy to install in existing greenhouses to increase productivity of an area by 5 times. Hexagro transfers its data and technical know-how to social projects to improve this systems with automation and provide a locally produced solutions to farmers in Colombia.\nWith every sale we make to consumers and corporate we finance our social projects which we plan to scale up internationally, empowering farmers in developing countries with vertical farming technology.\nWho does your solution serve, and in what ways will the solution impact their lives?\nTraditional farmers are facing enormous challenges related to soil degradation, global warming, and urbanization. In developing countries is expensive to access vertical farming technologies with a fast ROI. Hexagro Siembra Vertical develops low-cost, modular, and soilless farming systems to increase access to sustainable agricultural methods by transferring technology from Hexagro's automated vertical farming systems to offer turnkey solutions that can be easy to launch, produced and accessed locally.\nOur customers will be able to access vertical farming technology through low-cost systems that are easy-to-use and fast to launch for a faster ROI and a larger adaptability of soilless farming methods. Thanks to the remote training, technical support, and resource supply subscription our clients will not have to worry about launching operations with new technology.\nWe just launched Poty in EU to commercialize Hexagro\u2019s products to households while selling systems to companies and foundations. Thanks to the commercialization of systems for consumers a part of the revenue is dedicated to social projects for education and diffusion of these agricultural practices.\u00a0For each Poty unit sold in EU, Hexagro Siembra Vertical will install one more vertical pot in a social project in Colombia.\nWhich dimension of the Challenge does your solution most closely address?\nExplain how the problem, your solution, and your solution\u2019s target population relate to the Challenge and your selected dimension.\nAs previously explained, our platform solution is a way to completely cut the supply chain of fresh food and create a new food system based on a sharing and circular economy model through the adoption of urban farming technologies. These practices avoid the process of selection, processing, preservation, transportation and waste of fresh food (50% of fresh food is wasted by the end of the value chain).\nOn the other hand, our platform will directly connect consumers with producers so that farmers grow exactly what the market is demanding and consumers will finalize the growing process with their own systems.\nIn what city, town, or region is your solution team headquartered?\nWhat is your solution\u2019s stage of development?\nWho is the primary delegate for your solution?\nFelipe Hernandez (Colombia), CEO and Lead Design\nhttps://www.hexagro.io/\nIf you have additional video content that explains your solution, provide a YouTube or Vimeo link here:\nWhich of the following categories best describes your solution?\nDescribe what makes your solution innovative.\nThe competitors in our sector do not offer a platform approach for the fast adoption of urban farming technology, as a main difference we are leveraging a community of like-minded people that wants to become part of the solution and support the much needed renewing of agriculture.\nHexagro develops all of its solutions taking inspiration from nature and following Nature's time proven patterns using Biomimicry. In the case of our platform we are aligned with all of its core principles:\nDescribe the core technology that powers your solution.\nAeroponics is the most advanced form of hydroponics: the root system of the plants hangs in the air and a nutritive mist feeds them. Oxygen and moisture are key to the process of nutrient absorption in the cycle of photosynthesis. Nutrient salts move through the plant root surface along with water and oxygen to begin the conversion cycle. These nutrients transport up into the canopy level as compounds where photosynthesis uses light energy converting CO2 and nutrient salts into plant growth while releasing oxygen and water into the air. In summary, roots need oxygen while the canopy needs carbon dioxide. Hydroponic nutrient dosing is normally managed on a batch volumetric level. Everything is mixed at one time, irrigated, and when it runs out, mixed again. Managing nutrient dosage, water acidity levels (pH), and oxygen mix is a complex process. Aeroponics supercharges plant growth with a surplus of oxygen at the root surface. When this is combined with sensor technology and dynamic nutrient recipe dosing, plant growth is superior. Thanks to the technology transfer from Hexagro, our team provides In-Vitro germinated seedlings to farmers with the best genetic characteristics and allow a superior vegetative growth.\nProvide evidence that this technology works.\nHigh-pressure Aeroponics has been developed by the NASA in the 80's and has been used in the recent years from the most successful vertical farms in the world such as Aerofarms because it allows to create light-weight structures and have a further reduction in water and fertilzier consumption.\nAeroponics is a difficult method because it requires a lot of automation and sensing, our team has developed a propietary software and electronic mechanisms to overcome the challenges in nutrient dosing and balancing. Further more, thanks to the partnership with industry leaders, we overcome challenges such as the clogging of irrigation nozzles which is a common problem in aeroponic set ups.\nOn the other hand, we are developing In-Vitro germination technology that will allow our team to ship special varieties of lab-grown plants internationally while preserving them in a good state during shelf like or transportation to be further propagated in Aeroponics.\nPlease select the technologies currently used in your solution:\nWhat is your theory of change?\nSociety started because of the implementation of agriculture, it gave us the possibility to establish settlements without the need for gathering or hunting to find a food source. It changed and shaped humanity and our world.\nWe beleive agriculture can change our world again by incorporating it into our lives with urban farming, it not only represents a solution for a more resilient food system but it can also provide a series of positive effects in terms of community empowerment, food justice, food security, health and mental wellbeing and even the economy.\nImmagine a future in which everybody grows something, it would be like we used to do in our gardens some decades ago where the way to have a full meal was exchanging the over production of certain croptypes with local producers in the community. This time we can do the same thanks to the different technologies that can make the act of farming easier.\nBy integrating digital technologies in a food system we can know who grew our food, under which exact conditions and the impact that it had in terms of resource consumption. This can be a disruptive, exponential and transformative solution and a way to have a more resilient food system!\nOur community-platform approach is the \"uberization\" of urban farming, people will buy our solutions to become part of the community and they will be empowered to become micro-entrepreneurs by using the space they have available and growing plants for local buyers.\nAll of the data, sales, R&D and technology we are able to gather and develop will empower farmers in developing countries as they will increasingly adopt our solutions.\nSelect the key characteristics of your target population.\nWhich of the UN Sustainable Development Goals does your solution address?\nIn which countries do you currently operate?\nIn which countries will you be operating within the next year?\nHow many people does your solution currently serve? How many will it serve in one year? In five years?\nCurrently we have around 50 private customers of our consumer product as it has been recently launched, we have around 20 corporate clients for our hardware-as-a-service solution and around 3 farmer pilots in Colombia with one foundation using our systems for social projects.\nWe are planning to serve 100 people by the end of this year, and 10,000 in three years thanks to the viral approach of our future community. We calculate that the total beneficiaries in 5 years for the different business model that we are implementing we can impact around 500,000 people or even more, taking into account our corporate clients (employees) and the producers (farmers and more).\nWhat are your goals within the next year and within the next five years?\nFive year plan\nWhat barriers currently exist for you to accomplish your goals in the next year and in the next five years?\nHow do you plan to overcome these barriers?\nWhat type of organization is your solution team?\nHow many people work on your solution team?\n6 Full time members\n2 part-time members\n2 freelancers\n5 mentors and advisors\n3 international partner organizations: Ellen MacArhtur Foundation, Solar Impulse, and Singularity University\nHow many years have you worked on your solution?\n3.5\nWhy are you and your team well-positioned to deliver this solution?\nHexagro\u2019s founding team has the necessary backgrounds in design, engineering and business development in order to successfully lead a multidisciplinary team. The diversity of the manager\u2019s backgrounds and team professions allows the capillary scalability of the team by organizing the key activities of our company into Management and three main pillars: Product-Service Development, Operations Development and Commercial Development. In order to fill the gap of strong finance knowledge, our team has the support from an Advisory Board and our investors which advises the team on the financial modeling for the growth of the company. Recently, the Hexagro management team has integrated an advisor with the role of CFO to the team, John Cooper (US).\nWhat organizations do you currently partner with, if any? How are you working with them?\nWhat is your business model?\nHexagro leverages different business models to access various revenue streams starting from the direct sale of two product lines: Poty and the Living Farming Tree (LFT).\nWith the Poty product line we are able to make 50% margins in the hardware sales and 40% margins on the monthly subscription which will boost our member affiliations and the online Hexagro urban farmers community.\nThe unit procurement cost has been calculated for an initial of 100 LFT units and will decrease by 30% at least after full industrialization. After a market validation, the final market price for direct sales has been quantified in: \u20ac2,000/unit for S Kit (24 plants), \u20ac2,500/unit for M Kit (42 plants), \u20ac3,200/unit for L Kit (78 plants). Currently, Hexagro team is talking to leasing companies in europe to finance the costs of manufacturing the hardware and offer a lease-to-rent option for 24 months as: 42 euros/month S Kit, 50 euros/month M Kit, and 60 euros/month L Kit with a resource supply subscription service of 30-45 euros depending on the quantity of systems per month for each system.\nDo you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, or to other organizations?\nWhy are you applying to Solve?\nSolve challenge can help us to access different experts and mentors to support us on the barriers we are facing in terms of financing, commercialization and marketing. We would also like to understand the possibilities to find new team members through this network as well as learning about technologies and new business models to increase our impact. Of course, if we have some support with any possible grants that will be always helpful to advance faster in the development of our vision.\nIn which of the following areas do you most need partners or support?\nWhat organizations would you like to partner with, and how would you like to partner with them?\nMIT\u00a0Faculty and Solve Members, we think both can be of great support and very interesting to connect with.\nEventually we would like to partner-up with organization in the network that can support us to scale up our business model and why not, collaborating for any kind of implementations in our sector.\nSolution Team\nAt MIT Solve, we believe that to achieve a more sustainable and equitable future for all, we need new voices and solutions.

        "raw_content": "News & media\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\nCircular Economy Interview with HEXAGRO\u200a-\u200aAccessible Urban-Vertical Farming\n\u201cNature is a circular system that can provide abundance for everyone in a sustainable way. Hexagro develops its business and solutions inspired by time-proven nature patterns to develop a resilient and sustainable food system through urban agriculture. CE is a fundamental principle of biomimicry, and it represents a trillion-dollar opportunity. Our team is the first Italian startup to become part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s CE 100 Emerging Innovators to contribute with our circular approach to society.\u201d Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO.\nWHAT IS HEXAGRO?\nUrban farming is not scaling fast enough to impact the current inefficient food system; therefore, HEXAGRO is a platform to accelerate the adaptability of urban farming technologies. HEXAGRO offers a modular and IoT automated solution called the Living Farming Tree that allows anyone to grow fresh fruits and vegetables at home or in the office spaces. Moreover, due to the complicated and centralized supply chain, the food we buy contains a lower nutritional value, especially for vitamin C, which is 60% lower than in fresh vegetables and fruits. Statistics show that today around 50% of the fresh products are wasted at the end of the supply chain. This is another problem that we aim to solve with our solution\u200a\u2014\u200ato cut the food supply chain for fresher and healthier food.\nThe technology we use in Living Farming Tree is called Aeroponics, which was developed by NASA in the \u201980s and aimed to grow food on other planets three times faster than soil-based methods and with minimal water consumption. This approach is known as the most efficient soilless agriculture cultivation method today and allows us to cut water and fertilizer consumption by up to 40% if compared to conventional hydroponic methods like the NFT Technique. Furthermore, roots of the plants are entirely exposed and are sprayed with a fine mist of water and nutrients, the solution is then looped back to the source container. Furthermore, instead of watering plants every three days, with our aeroponic system, one should only refill the container once in three weeks. Another significance of the Aeroponics\u200a\u2014\u200aallows roots to be free from soil and, thus, to absorb 20,000 times more air than soil-based, decreasing the possibility of infections and improving the plant\u2019s growth.\nAdditionally, thanks to our design modular approach every component can be updated and repaired as needed, saving resources and reducing waste. Natural systems are inherently regenerative, every component is reused and repurposed, leaving no waste. In the same way, we want to be a positive force that shapes the future, not a system that exploits and degrades the environment. We design our products and activities to be part of a larger cycle, shifting the perspective from linear to circular: we want to give back as much as we take.\nHOW DID YOU START OUT?\nIn 2013, I (Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO) was finishing my bachelor studies in Product Design in Costa Rica, where pesticide usage in agriculture is a big problem. Interestingly, this is not well-known as Costa Rica is considered to be a highly sustainability-oriented country. For my final project work, I talked to several organic farm holders and found out a series of problems they are facing, such as climate change, soil degradation, urbanization and lack of young people willing to become farmers. Furthermore, I started to dig deeper and found that the massive urbanization was already taking place back then, and by 2050, 80% of the population is predicted to be living in the cities. This tendency naturally raised a question inside of me \u201cWho and how will produce so demanded fresh and organic food in the future?\u201d. That was the beginning of HEXAGRO.\nBiomimicry, a design method that focuses on nature as an inspiration for product development and applies many of Circular Economy principles, was the main framework for me. As a result, I came up with a new product concept to fill indoor environments in cities (with a modular approach) to make spaces green and productive, that later became the Living Farming Tree system. I presented this new product concept at my university in Costa Rica and, along with highly positive feedback, I received a scholarship for studying in Italy, where later on, I had a chance to work on my idea.\nIn 2016, HEXAGRO was chosen for the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge acceleration program, where I met my first co-founder Arturo Montufar. Later on, by joining in Thought For Food, I found my second co-founder Alessandro Grampa.\nHOW IS HEXAGRO DOING NOW?\nSince 2017, we have worked full time for HEXAGRO, and now we are six people on the team.\nCOVID-19 caused us certain difficulties. However, it also inspired us to design a new product for consumers facing lockdowns and, thereby, to make urban farming even more accessible. We are launching a new ecologically-friendly product\u200a\u2014\u200aPoty mainly for private users to grow food at home. Poty is a simplified and more affordable version of the Living Farming Tree.\nAdditionally, we are working on the social project Siembra Vertical, which aims to foster the usage of Vertical Farming technology in Colombia, my home country, and empower local farmers to adopt more productive and sustainable practices. For each Poty unit sold, we will install one more vertical pot tower in social projects together with foundations granting one farmer access to this fantastic technology.\nWHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM PARTICIPATION IN KICKSTART?\nKICKSTART taught us how to become better entrepreneurs and improve our business model and value proposition. We were able to develop meaningful relationships with corporates and investors participating in the program and learn about how they think. Thanks to this experience HEXAGRO ran a small crowdfunding campaign closing the sales of 5 indoor farming systems for corporates like Raiffeisen and tested a demo in which visitors had the chance to taste our plants grown during winter in Kraftwerk. We became a Solar Impulse labeled solution thanks to the Kickstart introduction and met our first angel investors during the program, an amazing personal and professional experience.\nInterviewee Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO.\nBy Alexandra Steinmann, Communication and Program Manager at KICKSTART.\n11 Dec 2023\n/\nCategory Name\nElevate Your Scale-Up's Growth Potential: Find Talents\n8 Dec 2023\n/\nCategory Name\nKickstart is not just a program\nRecent posts\nSubscribe to\nour newsletter\nContact us\nFAQ\nPrivacy Policy\nAbout us\nOur impact\nMeet the team\nMeet our partners\nFAQ\nFinance & Insurance / Food & Retail / Health & Wellbeing /\u00a0New Work & Learning / Smart Cities\nPartners / Startups and alumni / Advisors / Experts / Investors\nOur blog / Press and publications / Brand guidelines / Events\nIntrapreneurship program / Hackathons / Team sprints / Expert sessions"

Hexagro develops its business and solutions inspired by time-proven nature patterns to develop a resilient and sustainable food system through urban agriculture. CE is a fundamental principle of biomimicry, and it represents a trillion-dollar opportunity. Our team is the first Italian startup to become part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s CE 100 Emerging Innovators to contribute with our circular approach to society.\u201d Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO.\nWHAT IS HEXAGRO?\nUrban farming is not scaling fast enough to impact the current inefficient food system; therefore, HEXAGRO is a platform to accelerate the adaptability of urban farming technologies. HEXAGRO offers a modular and IoT automated solution called the Living Farming Tree that allows anyone to grow fresh fruits and vegetables at home or in the office spaces. Moreover, due to the complicated and centralized supply chain, the food we buy contains a lower nutritional value, especially for vitamin C, which is 60% lower than in fresh vegetables and fruits. Statistics show that today around 50% of the fresh products are wasted at the end of the supply chain. This is another problem that we aim to solve with our solution \u2014 to cut the food supply chain for fresher and healthier food.\nThe technology we use in Living Farming Tree is called Aeroponics, which was developed by NASA in the \u201980s and aimed to grow food on other planets three times faster than soil-based methods and with minimal water consumption. This approach is known as the most efficient soilless agriculture cultivation method today and allows us to cut water and fertilizer consumption by up to 40% if compared to conventional hydroponic methods like the NFT Technique. Furthermore, roots of the plants are entirely exposed and are sprayed with a fine mist of water and nutrients, the solution is then looped back to the source container. Furthermore, instead of watering plants every three days, with our aeroponic system, one should only refill the container once in three weeks. Another significance of the Aeroponics \u2014 allows roots to be free from soil and, thus, to absorb 20 000 times more air than soil-based, decreasing the possibility of infections and improving the plant\u2019s growth.\nAdditionally, thanks to our design modular approach every component can be updated and repaired as needed, saving resources and reducing waste. Natural systems are inherently regenerative, every component is reused and repurposed, leaving no waste. In the same way, we want to be a positive force that shapes the future, not a system that exploits and degrades the environment. We design our products and activities to be part of a larger cycle, shifting the perspective from linear to circular: we want to give back as much as we take.\nHOW DID YOU START OUT?\nIn 2013, I (Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO) was finishing my bachelor studies in Product Design in Costa Rica, where pesticide usage in agriculture is a big problem. Interestingly, this is not well-known as Costa Rica is considered to be a highly sustainability-oriented country. For my final project work, I talked to several organic farm holders and found out a series of problems they are facing, such as climate change, soil degradation, urbanization and lack of young people willing to become farmers. Furthermore, I started to dig deeper and found that the massive urbanization was already taking place back then, and by 2050, 80% of the population is predicted to be living in the cities. This tendency naturally raised a question inside of me \u201cWho and how will produce so demanded fresh and organic food in the future?\u201d. That was the beginning of HEXAGRO.\nBiomimicry, a design method that focuses on nature as an inspiration for product development and applies many of Circular Economy principles, was the main framework for me. As a result, I came up with a new product concept to fill indoor environments in cities (with a modular approach) to make spaces green and productive, that later became the Living Farming Tree system. I presented this new product concept at my university in Costa Rica and, along with highly positive feedback, I received a scholarship for studying in Italy, where later on, I had a chance to work on my idea.\nIn 2016, HEXAGRO was chosen for the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge acceleration program, where I met my first co-founder Arturo Montufar. Later on, by joining in Thought For Food, I found my second co-founder Alessandro Grampa.\nHOW IS HEXAGRO DOING NOW?\nSince 2017, we have worked full time for HEXAGRO, and now we are six people on the team.\nCOVID-19 caused us certain difficulties. However, it also inspired us to design a new product for consumers facing lockdowns and, thereby, to make urban farming even more accessible. We are launching a new ecologically-friendly product \u2014 Poty mainly for private users to grow food at home. Poty is a simplified and more affordable version of the Living Farming Tree.\nAdditionally, we are working on the social project Siembra Vertical, which aims to foster the usage of Vertical Farming technology in Colombia, my home country, and empower local farmers to adopt more productive and sustainable practices. For each Poty unit sold, we will install one more vertical pot tower in social projects together with foundations granting one farmer access to this fantastic technology.\nWHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM PARTICIPATION IN KICKSTART?\nKICKSTART taught us how to become better entrepreneurs and improve our business model and value proposition. We were able to develop meaningful relationships with corporates and investors participating in the program and learn about how they think. Thanks to this experience HEXAGRO ran a small crowdfunding campaign closing the sales of 5 indoor farming systems for corporates like Raiffeisen and tested a demo in which visitors had the chance to taste our plants grown during winter in Kraftwerk. We became a Solar Impulse labeled solution thanks to the Kickstart introduction and met our first angel investors during the program, an amazing personal and professional experience.\nInterviewee Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez Villa-Roel, Co-founder at HEXAGRO.\nBy Alexandra Steinmann, Communication and Program Manager at KICKSTART.\n--\n--\nWritten by KICKSTART\nKICKSTART is one of Europe\u2019s largest zero equity, multi-corporate ecosystem innovation platforms that runs a scale-up program for high-growth startups.\nHelp\nStatus\nAbout\nCareers\nBlog\nPrivacy\nTerms\nText to speech\nTeams"

We hope that these founders\u2019 interviews will inspire and motivate you as you undertake your own entrepreneurial journey.\nMy name is Felipe Hernandez.\u00a0I am 26 years old.\u00a0 I was born in Colombia, but I grew up in Costa Rica. My main field of experience is design. For 6 years, I\u2019ve worked with a variety of companies from different sectors across Latin America and Europe. My goal is to continue gaining experience working on entrepreneurial projects in various fields, such as Hexagro Urban Farming, which is now a startup based in Milan, Italy.\nI have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Product Design, in which I have had\u00a0successful trajectory and subsequently received a scholarship to study a Master of Science in Design and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I\u2019ve also been accepted into Alta Scoula Politecnica, a parallel extracurricular course of two years to develop multidisciplinary projects.\nI am passionate about design, sustainability, and technology, which is why I like to work hard and learn new things. Driven to innovative solutions, I consider myself a team player, and I am confident that design is the best tool to unify creativity with technical knowledge. My objective and vision as a social entrepreneur are to develop ideas that can make life more affordable while being regenerative for the environment and society, which is a frugal approach towards innovation.\nWe officially established the company on December 5, 2016. The idea originated from my Bachelor\u2019s thesis project on Product Design with the objective of developing a solution to increase healthy food accessibility in urban areas.\nThe thesis explored strategies of some organisms to adapt to different environments through geometrical patterns that repeat in nature. The first design solution was created from this inspiration. After our participation in the first edition of the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge in 2015, we also took inspiration in nature to help the development of our business model.\nOur customers will access fresh and clean organic products. Hobbyists will easily learn-by-doing about indoor farming. Chefs passionate for preparing special dishes can access the products they need all-year-round.\nYou can have your own indoor garden. Indoor farming represents an alternative to relocating crops, bringing healthy food production closer to the consumer. Current stand-alone systems for the consumer market are expensive, hard to use, and do not involve the users in a community. By involving the consumers in the production process, they become \u201cprosumers\u201d and will have the unique chance to harvest what is best and closer to their taste.\nA number of companies and start-ups are currently offering hydroponic solutions to the B2C market, especially in the EU and North America. However, none of them are offering customers a complete and integrated sustainable solution through hardware, software and services. No other competitor offers a product that targets the same needs listed below all-at-once:\nThere have been all kinds of challenges so far. The biggest one in the beginning was the formation of a multidisciplinary team that believed in the project and shared the same vision. We have been very lucky to find the right people, so I think it was about seizing the opportunity of becoming part of something that will be great. One way or another, we have resolved other big issues such as lack of funds, lack of time, and limited resources. We have overcome every challenge because even if we fail, we never give up.\nDream Team Retention Recipe\nFirst, I would recommend founders put themselves in their user\u2019s position. For example, design thinking is a very good tool for innovating products and services by focusing on the user. It shows how important iterating and experimenting are. Also, I would recommend entrepreneurs to take inspiration in nature through biomimicry. It can provide us with solutions that are efficient and sustainable.\nKey to Start Up Success: Customer Discovery\nWe have tried to avoid funding until we are ready to go to production and have enough traction to use those funds. However, we have participated in several accelerators, competitions, and exhibitions to increase our audience and generate interest in our products. Mostly, we are focusing on having a broad vision for our startup as the market is exponentially working, and there are countless fields for innovation.\nHexagro is part of the Kickstart Accelerator\u00a0program.\u00a0 Are you looking for an accelerator?\u00a0Check out our Global Accelerator Register!\nThere are always technical, commercial, and economic related questions that we are not able to answer right away. However,\u00a0we are a startup. We are innovating in the market to test and adapt our business model. If\u00a0we could answer all questions easily, it would mean we are not asking the right questions.\nRight now, we need to find equity-free funding and increase our traction to raise our value and proceed to a seed funding round. Also, during the last months we have been very busy; available time is little, but we hope this will change soon.\nAll the successful entrepreneurs I have met have told me that building a company is very hard; it will not be easy and is important to know we can fail. The most essential thing is to never give up and think BIG.\nWhat I Learned When My First Startup Failed\nIn my own entrepreneurial vision, our startup will change how we think about food production through collaborative farming. We are not just selling systems for growing food at home; we are diffusing culture, a healthier lifestyle, and the awareness of how people can become their own trustworthy producers.\nHexagro\u2019s main competitive advantage is the use of innovation in products and services. We integrate innovation into the process from the beginning with vision for the future. We are a team full of desire to make this world a better place, and that is why we have founded Hexagro Urban Farming as a for-benefit company.\nClarify the Vision\nAre you familiar with other startups you believe should be spotlighted? If so, we would like to hear from you.

        "raw_content": "This Startup Turns Indoor Spaces Into Urban Wellness Farms\nImagine a world where everyday public spaces have become lush urban farms\u2014a world where subway walkways grow nutrient-dense produce for anyone to utilize, and public elementary school gymnasium walls have morphed into a space for growing vegetables with the exact nutrient profile needed to support student health and vitality.With breakthroughs in multiple converging exponential technologies, this type of future is coming faster than you may think. Hexagro Urban Farming, a Singularity University Portfolio Company based in Milan, Italy, is a pioneer in this space. The venture is reconnecting people to nature indoors through its radically designed indoor farming solution offering users unique wellness experiences.Hexagro\u2019s urban farming solution\u2014an indoor, living farming tree\u2014is inspired by principles of biomimicry, in that its design draws upon the already proven successful systems of nature. The design of the company\u2019s Living Farming Tree pulls inspiration from the honeybee hive and also from the design of trees in order to create the modular, lightweight, space-efficient, and adaptable features of its unique indoor farming system.The Living Farming Tree not only grows nutrient-dense produce to increase access to healthy food but at large, Hexagro\u2019s offering is also focused on creating a new generation of indoor spaces that increase human wellness through unique engaging experiences with edible nature. To achieve this, Hexagro\u2019s indoor farming solution also includes an interactive user interface to collect critical health data from users. The data is then used in multiple functions depending on the placement of the product. In an office space, for example, the data collected can provide HR teams with employee health information to understand the wellness of staff and potential environmental stressors in the office building.\nWe recently sat down with Hexagro\u2019s co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer, Alessandro Grampa, to learn more about the company\u2019s innovative products, the company\u2019s impact today, and the team\u2019s vision for the future. Read on to learn about the true breakthrough possibilities of this next-generation indoor farming solution and the future of urban farming.\nHexagro\u2019s living, indoor urban farming tree has such a radical design. How did the idea first come to you?The story of Hexagro started with one of our co-founders while he was living in Costa Rica, which is a country known for sustainability, yet is also one of the biggest users of pesticides in the agriculture industry\u2014so much so that there is a huge mortality rate among farmers because of the country\u2019s widespread use of cancer-causing chemicals.This problem inspired us to take on the challenge of creating and finding technologies to build a solution that could grow food faster, with fewer resources, and without pesticides or chemicals. From this initial idea, we came to our first prototype, and the prototype worked. While creating our first prototype, we learned how big of a challenge that food production is today, and we also recognized the massive problem that people today spend 90% of their lifetime indoors, and in places that are often even more polluted than the outdoors. Still today, most people don\u2019t know this. But today there is a growing movement called biophilic design, which is focused on bringing back nature and natural elements inside of the indoor spaces where we live in order to increase wellness and improve our air quality and overall health. When we looked at these problems and this growing movement of biophilic design, we connected the dots and understood that we could bring greater wellness to people by using nature, and by growing food through technologies that would bring natural elements and processes back into indoor spaces.\nWhat is the mission of Hexagro and the main impact the company is striving for?At Hexagro we're reconnecting people to nature with food. Our vision is to allow anyone, anywhere, access to healthy food, and to achieve this vision we are reimagining the way that people can access, grow, and choose their food.How is biomimicry central to Hexagro\u2019s solution?Biomimicry looks to nature to find natural patterns that can be used in design. For billions of years, nature has tested natural elements to create the most efficient, sustainable, and exponential systems that we know of. For example, nature uses only the energy it needs and also relies on freely available energy. Nature also recycles all materials and is resilient to disturbances\u2014these are some remarkable principles.For the design of our Living Farming Tree, the honeycomb structure has been a source of inspiration with the hexagonal cells of the honeycomb. The joints and nodes of a tree where new branches can grow have also been a design inspiration, helping us to make our product very scalable. In this way, we started by using biomimicry in product design and now we are using it to develop concepts to create the exponential development of a decentralized network of farming that we are currently building. For this effort, we are using the model of a circular economy and a product-service platform to decrease the environmental footprint of our products and of our company at large.Another pattern of nature is that nature is locally attuned and responsive, and our Living Farming Tree is able to adjust to the environmental conditions of each different space. Every platform of the farming modules is completely independent of the others, so that you can change irrigation, nutrients, and lighting factors based on the type of plants, the environment, and how the plant is adjusting to the specific environment.How and where is Hexagro's technology being used today?Hexagro\u2019s systems today are primarily being used in offices, hotels, banks, and service companies that operate in the downtown areas of cities in Northern Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany. In these very dense urban areas, companies are using Hexagro\u2019s urban farming system to improve the overall wellness of the people in their indoor spaces.Part of the appeal of our urban farming product lies in its beautiful design, which impacts anyone who sees it. There is also a software component to the system that provides an interactive user experience guiding people on how to grow and harvest the right plants for themselves. The software also shows people how to grow and harvest the right plants based on how they want to be feeling. Users can approach the urban farming system and scan a QR code to report back how they are feeling in that exact moment. By using locally-placed sensors, we are able to combine this data on how people are feeling with the environmental data of the actual space where the products are situated. From this data, we can create an initial assessment of how people are feeling in that specific environment\u2014which today is a huge topic in the Human Resources field.\nWhat is a specific use case of Hexagro\u2019s living, farming tree?I\u2019ll share the specific example of a hotel here in Milan, where our system is installed in the lobby. The Living Farming Tree is a three-dimensional product that looks like a tree measuring about four feet wide and six feet tall. Because the design is very futuristic with lights and features growing plants, people are very attracted to it and frequently approach the system to explore it.When guests approach the system in the hotel, they can scan a QR code to gain access to the user experience, where they are asked how they are feeling compared to how they want to be feeling and whether they\u2019re having any particular symptoms at the moment. For this latter item, we are trying to gather data on the typical symptoms related to known indoor stressors, such as headaches, eye irritations, and so on.Based on this data, we provide answers about which plants should be harvested in this system. These recommendations are for plants that are far more nutritious and complex than what you might find in a grocery store, and they have much greater beneficial nutrients and aesthetics. Of course, these are plants that taste good, too. Hotel guests can then harvest the plants as a snack or an addition to their lunch, or even bring them home to create fresh pesto, for example.Can you explain more about the significance of biophilic design?Biophilic design is the science that shows how humans and nature are deeply connected, genetically connected, and that deprivation of nature in our lives causes serious health problems and stress-related diseases.There are many studies about this and projects that are proving the benefits to mental, physical, and community health when people spend more time interacting with nature and in a natural element\u2014such as being in natural light, spending more time near plants, and eating healthy food.The trend of biophilic design is also something that has led to the development of the WELL certification for buildings from the Green Building Association. WELL certification is the next evolution of LEED certification, which for many years was what enforced a degree of sustainability in the environmental footprint of buildings. But the problem with only focusing on outdoor emissions is that for many years we have never really understood indoor health pollutants.In contrast, the WELL certification is giving the first set of guidelines for creating indoor spaces that are beneficial to humans\u2014spaces that are restorative, regenerative, and create wellness for ourselves and for our communities. Currently, the certification is mostly used in office buildings, because that's where there is the most money, but it will likely soon move into other types of buildings, such as retail and residential spaces.Can you share some outcomes or results that you\u2019re most proud of?We are constantly impacting people's wellness perception in the spaces where our products live. This is the most immediate outcome that we are creating by bringing the system into offices and hotels. Another huge impact of these systems is the reduction of water required for growing plants. Our systems use 90-95% less water compared to traditional farming. We are also directly increasing the consumption of healthy food for people. Beyond this, Hexagro products are getting hundreds of people involved in growing and becoming educated about their food, which in the long run really shifts the perception of where and how food can be grown.You\u2019ve talked a lot about the future of urban farming. Can you paint a picture of what this future might look like?Imagine any existing interior space that is not being fully used becoming filled with systems that are producing and growing food. In places where we live and spend a lot of time, imagine these spaces becoming places where food is bringing more wellness and nature into everyone\u2019s lives. Imagine if walls, basements, and even the hallways of metro lines and public transportation that are currently just dark and under-utilized spaces could be turned into urban farms where Hexagro systems are growing food.You can also imagine new neighborhoods built with smart buildings that have communal areas that are not just spaces to hang out, but places for growing and exchanging food with your neighbors. Any possible indoor space in this future could become a place specifically designed to be filled with nature, urban farming systems that are producing food, and spaces that are building community in the process.\nHow has Hexagro leap-frogged or improved upon other approaches in urban farming?There are a few existing technologies\u2014high-pressure aeroponics, LED lighting, automation of indoor farming, 3D printing\u2014that we have been able to blend with more traditional technologies to create our hardware. Hexagro\u2019s design is radically and completely different from other approaches in the market. However, our main objective has always been to become an open-source platform. We are not trying to build a closed product where our way will be the only way. Instead, we are aiming to be the future platform for any type of indoor farming.How has Hexagro been impacted by its relationship with Singularity University?The funny thing about Hexagro\u2019s story is that everything that we were doing before we connected with SU is exactly what SU stands for today. Since the very beginning, we were describing ourselves as applying exponential technology and having a massive transformative purpose. But before working with SU we didn't realize that there was a theory written by someone else about these topics. When we came to SU, we had a lightning moment and said to each other, \"Wow, this is a real thing!\u201d and we say that there were already other people doing this, too. So in coming to SU, we had the experience of finally finding a place where people spoke our language. With SU the real impact for us has been getting help with the communications and positioning aspects of the product. We are now finally able to enter a category and create a brand image that corresponds to where SU is going, and where we want to take our startup in the future. Before becoming an SU Portfolio Company, we lacked this type of holistic mindset about our big picture. Now, we have one.SU\u2019s content and programs have also helped us develop a stronger view of the future. We realized that we finally had the tools to share the same picture and the same future with our employees, clients, and stakeholders. SU gives you a different and positive perspective on the future. So many people right now are worried about all of the change that is coming, but SU gives you all of the reasons why you should be excited about rather than afraid of these oncoming changes.You mentioned that Milan, Italy is now the capital of design and green living. Tell us about the ecosystem and how Hexagro interacts with it.Internationally, very few people know that Milan is having one of its best moments in the last fifty to seventy years. There is currently a huge boom of real estate development and economic growth, regardless of what is happening in Europe or in Italy at large.Milan is booming and becoming an international metropolis. This kind of development is mostly fostered by the local political situation that we have, namely one of the most sustainability-focused in our history, which is doing a lot for innovation and for green living.To give you an idea, Milan is one of the very few cities with a Chief Resiliency Officer, and the city is doing immense projects to prepare cities for oncoming years of climate change. For example, Milan is investing in planting three million trees around the city to regulate the temperature, building new lines of public transportation, and even developing entirely new smart city neighborhoods.Also, a huge project in Milan called MIND, Milan Innovation District is taking place right now, which initially was built for the 2015 Global Expo. MIND is building the first smart city from the ground up that is only designed for self-driving cars, wellness, and with a focus on life sciences for the wellness of people. Within MIND, they recently inaugurated one of the biggest genome research centers in Europe, the Human Technopole. The municipality expects up to 75,000 residents to be living and studying there within the next 5-10 years. Our new Hexagro office will also be placed inside this new area. There is also a very famous green skyscraper in Milan called the Bosco Verticale, which is one of the most iconic green skyscrapers in the world. Beyond winning many awards, it is a symbol that Milan as a city is saying that we are moving towards a green future. Milan as a city is changing dramatically.Is there a future project in the works that you want to share with readers?Hexagro is moreover thinking ahead of how we can use our know-how to impact even more people. We recently started a new social impact project in Colombia, which is where our co-founder Felipe Hernandez is from. The project is still at its early developments and little can be said about it, but our technology transfer projects are the proof of our constant dedication to developing farming solutions to empower anyone to produce healthy food and fight climate change. Zooming out, what is the big vision for Hexagro and the impact of the company?We envision our development for the future in three phases, along an exponential curve. The first phase is reconnecting people to nature, which is what we are doing today. Once our product is fully industrialized and able to sustain mass production growth, we are going to start focusing on reconnecting people to food. We are already growing food with our systems, but in the future, we will be able to grow food at a much greater scale and go into consumer markets and many other spaces that can grow food. Eventually, once there is a massive network of interconnected Hexagro systems, our vision is to work towards reconnecting people to people, and connecting this network of living, urban farming tree systems by creating a new decentralized system for urban growing.\nfollow\nleadership programs\nenterprise solutions\nresources\nabout\ncontact"

        "raw_content": "Giving me the chills\nBiomimicry helps urban farmers scale up\nThe Biomimicry Institute sat down virtually with Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel, CEO and founder of Hexagro Urban Farming, to ask him about his experience as an entrepreneur and Biomimicry Launchpad participant.\nWhat motivated you to start HEXAGRO?Hexagro started as a bachelor\u2019s thesis in Product Design when I started to analyze the problems that organic farmers in Costa Rica are facing in terms of productivity, sustainability, and health. These challenges are related to the high amounts of pesticides used by adjacent traditional farms, soil degradation, and climate change, so I began researching methods that didn\u2019t use soil as a growing medium. I analyzed the latest trends on soilless food production, starting from the indoor farming sector and through vertical farming, which proposes a more efficient way to grow food with less effort through new technologies like LED lighting and hydroponics in vertical configurations. I concluded that the main issue with these solutions was their scalability,\u00a0 since they followed a centralized model which is capital-intensive, requires infrastructure and expert personnel, and is difficult to set up and launch. The thesis made an analysis of nature\u2019s strategies to reduce space while maximizing productivity with a modular structure that was then translated into the first version of Hexagro\u2019s Living Farming Tree.\nWhat was your experience in the Biomimicry Launchpad? What did you learn and how did you apply that to your business?This project became a team and then a finalist in the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge, thanks to the inspiration taken from nature to develop the first product iteration. After that, we were invited to participate in the Launchpad program. From 2015-2016, we participated in many training sessions and had access to expert mentoring. This gave the team the tools to define a clear business model, which changed the approach of the first design iteration and led to a second design iteration that gave the basis for the current pre-industrial product. Today, the team continues to take inspiration from Nature\u2019s Unifying Patterns to create solutions that follow the principles of biomimicry for every aspect, from product development to marketing and business development. Hexagro Urban Farming was incorporated as a for-benefit company in Milan, Italy, after the participation in the finals of the Launchpad in late 2016.\nThe Hexagro team\nTell us about your work to incorporate the Living Farming Tree in hotels and workplaces. What are you hoping to accomplish?Our vision for Hexagro is a future in which anybody, anywhere, can access healthy food through urban farming. In order to get there, the team has determined a strategy to enter the market and launch its first product, the Living Farming Tree (LFT). Urbanization is booming, and at the same time we are spending around 90% of our time indoors where the conditions are not always meant for people\u2019s well-being. This disconnection from nature within working spaces has direct consequences in employees\u2019 health and psychology and can lead to lack of productivity and engagement, which could have direct consequences for companies. We are reconnecting employees to nature and their work through a \u201cgamified\u201d urban farming experience in which users follow the instructions from a digital interface to perform various maintenance tasks during the cultivation process, aiming to achieve a successful harvest of medicinal herbs for fresh infusions to improve well-being and productivity. Our LFT educates and increases the awareness of indoor farming technologies, while reducing the costs of office greenery maintenance. It engages people with their company and becomes a \u201cgravitational center\u201d for social gathering and relaxation.\nThe Living Farming Tree (LFT) utilizes a \u201cgamification\u201d strategy to engage employees in offices to become active participants in their own health.\nWhat are the benefits to a modular, decentralized system?Our team took inspiration from nature to create a system that could adapt to any space available and provide the maximum diversity with the lowest inventory. The Living Farming Tree has a standard configuration, but our plug-and-play components, along with our 3D-printed node and IoT automation systems, allow our system to adapt to any space available indoors (horizontally or vertically) to make it productive.\nWhat is your ultimate hope for Hexagro?We envision a new and regenerative food system based on the circular and sharing economy, helping people to grow plants and make a profit through a Smart Urban Farming Network. This nature-inspired model can increase accessibility to healthy food, decentralize indoor farming production, create new economic opportunities, and reconnect people to people through food.\nFor more information:Biomimicry Instituteinfo@biomimicry.orgbiomimicry.org\nPublication date:\nFri 5 Jul 2019\nCollaboration on 700 m2 pilot farm in China\nTackling climate issues with low-resource consuming growing towers\n\"We can focus more on quality and how the product satisfies consumer needs\u201d\nUK grower trials aeroponic propagation system\nIrish supermarket to sell hydroponic microgreens\nTodd P.

        "raw_content": "Increasing Access to Indoor Farming Technologies to Decentralize Food Production\nToday, we are aware of the consequences the traditional food system has on our environment \u2014 perhaps indoor farming technologies can help. For a world of 9 billion people by 2050, we have to drastically transform our food supply chain, as urbanization rises and the number of people involved in farming decreases. In the case of fresh produce, from the moment we harvest a plant, it begins to lose its nutritional and medicinal properties. After an energy-intense cycle of refrigeration and transportation to cities, 50% of fresh products go to waste by the time they arrive at a consumer\u2019s table.\nPeople are already developing solutions targeting these issues, especially aiming to cut down the distance between producer and consumer with healthier products. Many of these technologies come from greenhouse farming and vertical farming industries which have shown steady but slow growth over the years. This market growth is slow because of scalability factors in terms of infrastructure, personnel, and technology, which are not available everywhere and are reserved for companies that can afford to make long-term investments in the field. So, how can we provide an increasing demand for fresh products by 2050? What other factors are influencing life in cities? Why is only 2% of the population (in the US) working in farming-related activities? Why have young people lost interest in farming?\nWe spend 90% of our lives indoors, in low-quality environments, cast into frenetic cities completely disconnected from nature. Such a disconnect has a heavy impact on our lives. We are stressed, dietarily disturbed, unproductive, and unable to nurture societal relations. We pay doctors, yoga teachers, and therapists to improve our wellbeing and turn us into the most productive version of ourselves, but the walk towards a happier, healthier, more productive way of life still looks like a never-ending hike. So, the question is: if there is no magic pill that will take the stress away from our lives forever, what about a plant?\nPsychoterratica describes how a lack of nature can make us sick. Adults spend from one-third to one-half of their waking hours at work. The office space is often perceived as the most stressful environment, impacting employees\u2019 health and businesses\u2019 financials. Many organizations don\u2019t consider employee wellbeing, but improvements in staff\u2019s physical and mental health have a significant positive financial impact. For example, challenges such as loss of productivity, absenteeism, and disengagement at work have a cost \u20ac25K per person annually for \u201cunwell\u201d employees, compared to roughly \u20ac5K for a healthy employee. Healthy employees have more energy, get more done in less time, and are more likely to be engaged and in a good mood. At Hexagro we see this problem as an opportunity to build an exponential platform to increase access to technologies like indoor-soilless farming, which can bring nature closer to us in cities.\nThe concept of biophilia suggests that as human beings we have an innately emotional affiliation to the natural world. In fact, in the last twenty years, studies have provided convincing evidence that when we connect to nature, our mental and physical health, as well as our job performance, significantly improve. A report by Interface reveals that simply introducing greenery and natural elements allows a business to increase employee wellbeing by 70% and productivity by 15%. Moreover, absenteeism decreases by 10%, generating enormous cost-savings for companies given that 90% of business overheads are linked to staff and salaries.\nThe act of farming is an interaction with nature; people take care of the plants and the plants provide the nutrients we need.\nThe connection between people and nature, through activities like gardening and farming, provides a physical and psychological benefit. Edible plants have a different value than ornamental plants, they require constant attention and provide an end product. The act of farming is an interaction with nature; people take care of the plants and the plants provide the nutrients we need. Moreover, the regular and active interaction between growers and plants like indoor plants has direct benefits for people\u2019s physical and mental health. Farming increases longevity and reduces stress. It\u2019s not just about health effects, either: the social benefits of gardening can also increase wellness.\nBecause of these benefits, Hexagro strives to reconnect people to nature with interactive indoor farming experiences. We use an IoT platform to guide users in performing simple plant-maintenance tasks to achieve successful harvests and fill inert and empty spaces with plants. Using the biomimicry method, nature was the main source of inspiration for the development of our first product, the Living Farming Tree (LFT). With the Honeybee Hive\u2019s hexagonal patterns and the 3D Node System of Trees, we developed a space-filling modular system that can be configured in \u201ctree\u201d, horizontal and vertical geometries using the same parts and same technology. We recalled natural elements in the LFT design, using the principles of biophilia. Hexagro\u2019s objective is to make any available indoor space productive. The LFT displays beautiful living plants that grow on-site, and create an emotional connection with the people around it.\nThis gamified cultivation process drives employees to input data about how they feel in the workplace. Based on employee responses the LFT will recommend to harvest a particular mix of medicinal plants that can improve sick building syndrome symptoms (headache, eye irritation, nausea, etc.). The LFT becomes a focal point where people gather and share time close to plants inside places that were previously inert. Ultimately, the comforting presence of nature engages employees and visitors and increases productivity.\nWe are offering the LFT as a service to companies in Europe that are looking for ways to maximize their productivity by improving employee wellness at the workplace. The LFT monitors environmental data \u2014 such as air temperature, humidity, light levels, CO2 and airflow \u2014 which are relevant for plant growth but also for a wellness assessment of an indoor space. This information is provided to our customer\u2019s HR manager, with a report including anonymous wellness-related data from employees.\nHexagro\u2019s Living Farming Tree acts as multiple products at once:\nEditor\u2019s Picks \u2014 Related Articles:\n\u201cDesign for a Circular Future: Creating Positive Products and Regenerating Our Cities and Regions\u201d\n\u201cHow Trees Can Save Us\u201d\nOur approach to corporate wellness sets up the base for a new indoor farming product-service platform. The technology and the service developed for the LFT are scalable to different markets and to industrial applications.. Our mission is to build an ecosystem of key stakeholders that will allow the collaborative urban farming model to thrive and expand exponentially in cities and transform consumers into prosumers and cities into vertical farms within a circular economy or as we like to call it the \u201cSmart Urban Farming Network.\u201d Our vision is a future in which anybody, anywhere can access healthy food. Agriculture has changed the path of humanity before, and we believe it can do so again.\nHexagro Urban Farming is a software and hardware product-service platform to increase the accessibility to indoor farming technologies. After the project was selected as one of the finalists of the first edition of the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge in 2016, Hexagro was established as a Social-Benefit company in Milan. As part of Hexagro\u2019s social mission, the know-how and automation technologies are being licensed to a social project in Colombia called Siembra Vertical that aims to provide low-cost and high-yield aeroponic solutions for traditional farmers trying to overcome climate change, soil degradation and the consequences of large-scale urbanization.\nHexagro was selected as the first Italian startup to join the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s CE 100 Emerging Innovators after Intesa San Paolo Bank awarded the team a prize during Seeds&Chips event in Milan for the participation in the Startup Initiative. Currently, Hexagro is offering the Living Farming Tree service to pilot projects in Italy and Switzerland with companies such as AccorHotels, Raiffeisen Bank and Intesa San Paolo Bank. By the end of 2019, Hexagro plans to finalize 50 service contracts in the current regions and to close their seed round so that they can scale-up across Europe during 2020.\nSTEM Education \u2013 Creating a Global Impact\nContaining Migration is a Mistake\nFelipe Hernandez - CEO at Hexagro\nFelipe Hernandez, 28, is an Industrial Designer and Social Entrepreneur born in Colombia, raised in Costa Rica and currently based in Milan, Italy. Hexagro Urban Farming is an early-stage startup founded in early 2017 with an international team of 8 people.\nRelated Posts\nOver Two-Thirds of World\u2019s Leading Companies Don\u2019t Have Emissions Reduction Targets\nCompanies Are Hiding Their Climate Progress.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Meet a Biomimic: Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel, CEO and Founder of Hexagro Urban Farming\nby Biomimicry Institute | Jul 2, 2019 | Biomimicry Launchpad, Blog, Meet a Biomimic, University Education\nThe Biomimicry Institute sat down virtually with Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel, CEO and founder of Hexagro Urban Farming, to ask him about his experience as an entrepreneur and Biomimicry Launchpad participant.\nWhat motivated you to start HEXAGRO?\nHexagro started as a bachelor\u2019s thesis in Product Design when I started to analyze the problems that organic farmers in Costa Rica are facing in terms of productivity, sustainability, and health. These challenges are related to the high amounts of pesticides used by adjacent traditional farms, soil degradation, and climate change, so I began researching methods that didn\u2019t use soil as a growing medium. I analyzed the latest trends on soilless food production, starting from the indoor farming sector and through vertical farming, which proposes a more efficient way to grow food with less effort through new technologies like LED lighting and hydroponics in vertical configurations. I concluded that the main issue with these solutions was their scalability,\u00a0 since they followed a centralized model which is capital-intensive, requires infrastructure and expert personnel, and is difficult to set up and launch. The thesis made an analysis of nature\u2019s strategies to reduce space while maximizing productivity with a modular structure that was then translated into the first version of Hexagro\u2019s Living Farming Tree.\nWhat was your experience in the Biomimicry Launchpad? What did you learn and how did you apply that to your business?\nThis project became a team and then a finalist in the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge, thanks to the inspiration taken from nature to develop the first product iteration. After that, we were invited to participate in the Launchpad program. From 2015-2016, we participated in many training sessions and had access to expert mentoring. This gave the team the tools to define a clear business model, which changed the approach of the first design iteration and led to a second design iteration that gave the basis for the current pre-industrial product. Today, the team continues to take inspiration from Nature\u2019s Unifying Patterns to create solutions that follow the principles of biomimicry for every aspect, from product development to marketing and business development. Hexagro Urban Farming was incorporated as a for-benefit company in Milan, Italy, after the participation in the finals of the Launchpad in late 2016.\nThe Hexagro team\nTell us about your work to incorporate the Living Farming Tree in hotels and workplaces. What are you hoping to accomplish?\nOur vision for Hexagro is a future in which anybody, anywhere, can access healthy food through urban farming. In order to get there, the team has determined a strategy to enter the market and launch its first product, the Living Farming Tree (LFT). Urbanization is booming, and at the same time we are spending around 90% of our time indoors where the conditions are not always meant for people\u2019s well-being. This disconnection from nature within working spaces has direct consequences in employees\u2019 health and psychology and can lead to lack of productivity and engagement, which could have direct consequences for companies. We are reconnecting employees to nature and their work through a \u201cgamified\u201d urban farming experience in which users follow the instructions from a digital interface to perform various maintenance tasks during the cultivation process, aiming to achieve a successful harvest of medicinal herbs for fresh infusions to improve well-being and productivity. Our LFT educates and increases the awareness of indoor farming technologies, while reducing the costs of office greenery maintenance. It engages people with their company and becomes a \u201cgravitational center\u201d for social gathering and relaxation.\nThe Living Farming Tree (LFT) utilizes a \u201cgamification\u201d strategy to engage employees in offices to become active participants in their own health.\nWhat are the benefits to a modular, decentralized system?\nOur team took inspiration from nature to create a system that could adapt to any space available and provide the maximum diversity with the lowest inventory. The Living Farming Tree has a standard configuration, but our plug-and-play components, along with our 3D-printed node and IoT automation systems, allow our system to adapt to any space available indoors (horizontally or vertically) to make it productive.\nWhat is your ultimate hope for Hexagro?\nWe envision a new and regenerative food system based on the circular and sharing economy, helping people to grow plants and make a profit through a Smart Urban Farming Network. This nature-inspired model can increase accessibility to healthy food, decentralize indoor farming production, create new economic opportunities, and reconnect people to people through food.\nSupport nature-inspired problem-solvers\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSuccess!\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nSubscribe\nWant to write for AskingNature?\nContact us at hello(at)biomimicry.org!\nTap into nature:\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use\nA Member of\nInspiration in Your Inbox\nJoin thousands of nature-inspired innovators and\u00a0keep up-to-date\u00a0with\u00a0the latest biomimicry news, research, events, and more.\nWe will use the information to be in touch with you via email.

Firefighters observe weather and drought conditions to maintain an appropriate state of readiness to allow quick response to wildfires. The Agency also uses prescribed or controlled fire as a management tool to benefit Virginia ecosystems.\nHealthy, sustainable forests are essential to our economy and provide benefits to people and wildlife in Virginia. The Virginia Department of Forestry monitors the health, composition, and inventory of Virginia\u2019s public and private forests to inform land management practices. Field staff assist landowners through technical assistance and management planning to support conservation and sustainable forestry practices.\nConserving and managing forestland is critical for the health of our environment, the supply of forest products, and the overall quality of life. The Virginia Department of Forestry works to ensure that forests and the waters that flow from them are protected today and for future generations. By developing existing markets and identifying emerging opportunities, the agency supports forest industry and rural economies.\nForests are vital for preserving and improving water quality; forested watersheds are critical sources of drinking water, provide habitat for fish and wildlife, and offer recreational opportunities. The Virginia Department of Forestry protects these water sources through timber harvest site inspections and development of best management practices for harvesting operations. The agency cooperates with partners and landowners to preserve riparian buffers and protect water quality.\nFrom public parks and yard trees to greenway corridors and streamside buffers, trees provide critical benefits to people and communities. The Virginia Department of Forestry seeks to develop diverse and healthy forests that are accessible for all. The program supports cities, towns, and communities as they establish and maintain their urban tree canopy.\nThe Virginia Department of Forestry creates and uses a variety of conservation education resources for both children and adults. Field staff delivers programming to improve knowledge of forest ecosystems, forest resources, and forestry practices. Virginia\u2019s state forest system provides opportunities for education, recreation, and demonstration of forestry practices. All state forests are sustainably managed to provide the greatest benefits to Virginians.\nAbout Us\nPlanting Trees\nTree Selection and Planting\nRight Tree, Right Place\nMany trees planted each year by well-meaning homeowners and community workers will never flourish because they are hopelessly unsuited for the conditions in which they are placed. Before rushing in to plant just any available trees, do enough research and planning to ensure success.\nFactors to Consider\nTaking a bit of time to plan before putting a tree in the ground will save money and headaches in the future. When choosing a tree, make sure to do a complete site evaluation to understand the conditions and ensure the best tree for the site chosen.\nWhen to Plant\nIt is best to plant while the trees are dormant in late fall, winter, or early spring.\nDeciduous trees planted in the fall, after the heat of summer diminishes, have several months to re-establish their root system and often emerge healthier the next spring than those transplanted in the heat of summer.\nEvergreens should only be planted in late winter or early spring \u2013 but beware of foliage drying and \u201cwinter burn\u201d. Unlike deciduous trees, evergreens hold onto their foliage throughout the winter, and to keep them green they need a lot of moisture. Bright sun and harsh winds in the winter months can cause the needles to lose moisture, and plant roots cannot take up enough water from the soil in frozen ground, which can cause dry foliage and \u201cwinter burn\u201d.\u202fIn newly planted trees where the root system is already too small for the canopy, this problem is made worse.\nPlanting Different Types of Nursery Stock\nTrees may be purchased as bare-root, container-grown, or balled and burlapped. Correct planting and initial maintenance are essential for a long, healthy life for your tree. The most common cause of poor tree health is poor planting: too deep, too shallow, or in too small an area. The objective is to plant the tree so that the root flare at the bottom of the trunk is at (or slightly above) the surrounding ground level.\nThe most important thing to remember when choosing to plant bare-root trees is you must not let the roots dry out. Soak roots in water before, during and after planting to ensure good contact with the surrounding soil. Follow these steps for successful planting:\nTrees sold in containers are the most common type of stock found in nurseries. When moving a tree, always pick it up by the container and NOT by the trunk!\nTrees sold balled and burlapped are usually larger stock that instantly add impact to the area in which you are planting. They are quite heavy and require multiple hands to successfully plant them. When moving a tree, always pick it up by the root ball or binding strings and NOT by the trunk!\nAdditional Resources\nThis training manual includes 10 units, including Tree Anatomy, Tree Physiology, Environmental Factors Affecting Trees, Tree Identification, Tree Selection, Tree Planting and Care, Tree Pruning, Tree Problems and Diagnosis, Invasive Species in Virginia, and Trees and People in the Community.\nForestry topic information sheet helps in identifying the most common acorns and nuts in Virginia to assist in the collection for our nursery.\nPictorial sheet showing the types of bark with photo samples of each.\nBy Ellen Powell, Conservation Education Coordinator \u2013 Presentation reviews the basics of tree identification.\nForestry topic information sheet provides information about best practices to be used in establishing Eastern white pine to encourage the best possible survival.\nIdentification book is a favorite of teachers, Scout leaders and outdoor enthusiasts.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"
