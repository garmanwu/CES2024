        "raw_content": "BeAware launches Line of Free Apps for the Deaf at CES 2024\nOnly Apps that Convert Smartphones into Customizable Alert Devices With Fastest Transcriptions\nNo Ads, Private BeAware Apps Are Entrusted by Deaf People in Over 50 Countries\nAvailable in 30+ Languages\nMakes Lives of Deaf People Safer & Easier \u2013 Used an Average of 4 Times/Day Every DayConverts Ambient Noise to Visual & Haptic Alerts\nBeAware https://www.deafassistant.com/, creator of the free fastest transcription app for the Deaf and hard of hearing, announced today that it will launch a new line of free fast, accurate apps for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community at CES 2024: the BeAware Conference Captioning App and HealthScribe app, designed to make the world easier and safer for Deaf people and the only specialized Deaf assistant apps designed with easy communication and safety in mind.\nConference Captioning App Only Tool for Real-time Captioning for In-Person Events\nThe BeAware Conference Captioning app is the only tool that provides the Deaf and hard of hearing quick accessibility to any in-person event within 15 seconds for real-time captioning for speeches, live events, press conferences, and trade shows. Based on the popular BeAware d/Deaf Assistant app, the top 50 medical app in 13 countries and currently in use in over 50 countries and 30+ languages, speakers and event organizers can easily capture live transcriptions allowing Deaf attendees to stream captions in real-time on their smartphones, ensuring an inclusive experience for all participants \u2014 especially important for emergency press conferences and alerts. For developers, the BeAware Conference Captioning App Enterprise version is also available with API access to integrate their apps with BeAware, along with accessibility for live translations into 30+ languages. Key markets for the BeAware Conference Captioning app include healthcare, government, first responders, and hospitality industries. See the BeAware video at: https://vimeo.com/838702172\nHealthScribe Offline Private Live Transcriptions for the Deaf & Translations for Limited English Proficiency Patients\nHealthScribe is an essential tool used in hospital emergency rooms to provide offline fast privacy-safe live transcriptions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients, as well as translations for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). Live transcriptions and live translations are available while the patient is 100% offline without storing the user\u2019s data of personal information, making it the perfect companion for geriatric hospitals and medical institutions with a diverse patient language base. Implemented and licensed specifically for each hospital and free for patients, the solution is paid by hospitals depending on the implementation scale, number of languages, and whether managed devices are required. HealthScribe is AgeTech that helps older people with hearing loss become much more confident at the doctor\u2019s office and is also available after a free trial at $100/month for doctors to purchase directly.\nReducing Inequalities: Part of the 10th UN Sustainable Development Goal\nFocused on reducing inequalities as part of the 10th UN Sustainable Development Goal, BeAware helps organizations and governments support their commitment to accessibility by providing dedicated streams with blazing-fast accuracy. An example of BeAware\u2019s real-time live translations was seen at the recent Michigan\u2019s Build Institue entrepreneurial support institute, which showcased the ability to use BeAware\u2019s technology, even without the need to download the app.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are 430 million people worldwide who identify as hard-of-hearing or Deaf, or 1 person in every 3 households in every neighborhood in every country. Learning to read lips is not enough for safety. With BeAware, the app reads text aloud during live phone calls and more, assisted by customizable preset phrases. BeAware even provides visual LED flashes and sensory alert vibrations through smartwatches and smartphones and users can customize alerts, so if a baby is crying, a deaf mom can get a vibration through a push notification, along with an LED flash; or if a hard-of-hearing delivery driver is pulled over, the driver can use the app to transcribe what a police officer is saying and can even communicate with the officer, without having to use sign language.\n\u201cI was tired of seeing all the apps that charge $100/year for essential everyday tools needed by the Deaf,\u201d said Saamer Mansoor, Founder & CEO, BeAware. \u201cSo four friends and I joined together to make a difference and do something about it. The result was BeAware. We developed the app for the Deaf and optimized it to make it the best possible experience.\u201d\nBeAware Features:\nBeAware at CES 2024 & Availability\nBeAware will be at CES 2024, Booth #60464 at the Venetian Expo, Eureka Park, Level 1, Hall G.

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nFollowing the landmark over-the-counter hearing aid legislation passed in 2022, consumers have easier access to dozens of options to ameliorate mind-to-moderate hearing loss. We\u2019ve tested many different hearing solutions over the past year, but as expected, the show floor at CES 2024 will be full of innovative alternatives that may very well shape our review calendar in the months ahead.\nFrom super-customizable hearing aids to wearable caption glasses, here are six of the coolest hearing innovations being showcased at CES 2024.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n1. XanderGlasses\nThe Xander Captioning Glasses offer an innovative, hands-free way for people with hearing loss to follow conversations.\nXanderGlasses are a Reviewed AccessABILITY Award winner in 2024, and we\u2019re especially excited to learn initial shipments will be in consumers\u2019 hands as soon as this month. Diverging from the hearing aid path altogether, XanderGlasses are a pair of self-captioning eyewear.\nWhether watching TV or making conversation in a crowded restaurant, captions of the spoken word appear right in front of the wearer\u2019s face for easy reading through Vuzix augmented reality technology.\nA single pair costs $4,999, including all the cables, cases, and maintenance supplies you need. For techies who want to try a unique way to solve an age-old problem, Xander offers an interesting opportunity.\n2. ClearSense Audio\nThe CleanSense Audio app subscription is $3 a month.\nFor those feeling a bit of sticker shock from the price of XanderGlasses or over-the-counter hearing aids, ClearSense Audio may offer a more approachable solution. Priced at just $3 per month, this intuitive smartphone app selectively reduces environmental noise by about 25 dB to maximize clarity of sound.\nThe app functions well with standard headphones or Bluetooth hearing aids, lowering the barrier to entry considerably. Especially for those who may be shy about using assistive devices, this software-based solution helps in whatever form factor the user chooses.\nWe tested a beta version of ClearSense Audio and liked it enough to honor it with a 2024 AccessABILITY Award.\n3. Amadeus Powered By Absolute Audio Labs\nThe Amadeus Powered By Absolute Audio Labs is set to debut as an OTC hearing aid in Q2 2024.\nUnderstanding speech is hugely important to those with hearing loss. That\u2019s precisely why so many hearing aid manufacturers target their tech to offer the best speech quality possible.\nThe Amadeus Receiver-in-Canal hearing aid takes a different route by offering a system on a chip not unlike the ones powering high-quality music earbuds. This distinction, its tech partners at Absolute Audio Labs suggest, offers the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d in producing excellent speech and music quality alike.\nThis product is expected to make its debut as an OTC hearing aid in Q2 2024.\n4. Concha Labs hearing aids\nConcha Labs hearing aids have not been FDA approved yet in the United States.\nWhile Concha Labs hearing aids must be FDA approved before being sold in the United States, the combined technology and discreet profile of this product presents some exciting possibilities.\nNot only is the lineup sold to blend into four different skin tones, but it also features patented Soundscope technology that allows users to create a series of hearing profiles to match specific situations. Many similar hearing aids have preset sound profiles, but this is the most emphasis we\u2019ve seen on actually making your own.\n5. BeAware Conference Live Captioning V4\nScan the QR code t0 download the BeAware Conference Live Captioning V4 smartphone app.\nConferences and convention halls often aren\u2019t overly accessible for attendees who may be deaf or hard of hearing. BeAware Conference Live Captioning is a free app that allows conference speakers to auto-generate caption streams that can be quickly accessed by anyone in the area.\nHosts simply start and name a stream using the app, and then tap a button to start a caption stream. That stream can be found by others on the app via the provided name. This free app is more suitable for larger clients than individual consumers, but it\u2019s still an inventive and necessary hearing solution.\n6. Clearcast\nThe Clearcast is great for on the go.\nNot quite a hearing aid, ClearCast is the first new FDA-registered Assistive Listening Device since 2004. This product is meant for those who need occasional hearing help in certain situations. Just slip on the neckband, pop in the included earbuds, and you can be hearing conversations and voice with a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio.\nFor those with more substantial hearing loss, an external microphone can be placed closer to the source of the desired sound.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.

Skyline can be closed for superior noise blocking, or opened to vent the ear and reduce occlusion effects. xMEMs will also be showcasing Cowell, reportedly the world\u2019s smallest solid-state micro speaker that delivers superior high-frequency response and clarity, plus a wider sound stage for TWS earphones and hearing aids.\u00a0Montara Plus, is said to be the world\u2019s highest output MEMS micro speaker, capable of sound pressure levels up to 120 dB at 200 Hz, making it an ideal full-bandwidth transducer for audiophile-grade in-ear monitors and high-end over-ear headphones. See it at: Venetians Suite 29-235.\nThe xMEMS Skyline DynamicVent (top) can be situated in the vent of a hearing aid or earbud to control the amount of passive (unprocessed) sound allowed into the ear. Essentially, it acts as a controllable gate: the closed position (bottom left) shuts out the ambient sound and maximizes the processed sound, improving bass tones and streamed music; the open position (bottom right) allows more ambient passthrough for better spatial awareness and reduced occlusion (own-voice) effects.\nWhat did we miss?\nYou can view all the exhibitors at the CES website.

        "raw_content": "Study Suggests Smart Assistant Design Improvements for Deaf Users\nBy Jessica Hallman\nDespite the inherent challenges that voice-interaction may create, researchers at the Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology recently found that deaf and hard-of-hearing users regularly use smart assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri in homes, workplaces and mobile devices.\nThe work highlights a clear need for more inclusive design, and presents an opportunity for deaf and hard-of-hearing users to have a more active role in the research and development of new systems, according to Johnna Blair, an IST doctoral student and member of the research team.\n\"As smart assistants become more common, are preloaded on every smartphone, and continue to provide benefits to the user beyond just the ease of voice activation, it's important to understand how deaf and hard-of-hearing users have made smart assistants work for them and the realistic challenges they continue to face,\" said Blair.\nIn their study, Blair and Saeed Abdullah, assistant professor of information sciences and technology, conducted in-depth interviews with deaf users of smart assistants and collected survey data from individuals with mild to profound hearing loss.\nTechnology like Amazon\u2019s Alexa has room to grow to fully benefit individuals with hearing loss. Image credit: Ajay Suresh via Wikimedia Commons.\nThey found that users from these populations\u2014even those with profound deafness\u2014used smart assistants to accomplish daily tasks, such as checking the weather, setting reminders and initiating GPS directions. They also identified common challenges these users face in their interactions with smart assistants, such as the default higher-pitched female voices used on many smart assistants being incompatible with hearing aids, and difficulty of use in public places with background noise that competes for their attention, such as nearby conversations or the average commotion in a grocery store.\n\"When we started working on this specific research problem, I initially had no idea how individuals with hearing loss would potentially use these smart assistants given they were relying mostly on audio and voice interactions,\" said Abdullah. \"So, it is really interesting to see how different people have quite different ways of engaging with smart assistants.\"\nAdded Blair, \"By empathizing with these users, we want to highlight new design features that can make smart assistants more accessible to hearing needs.\"\nNew design features can make smart assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri more accessible to hearing needs. Image credit: Wikimedia Commons.\nUsing smart assistants with all these constraints\u2014in a quiet home, facing the device and dropping all other tasks\u2014hinders the naturalistic, \"embedded in daily life\" experience that people specifically seek from smart assistants. Therefore, the researchers suggest future design features that could better accommodate hearing needs, such as customizable voice characteristics; tangible information about common commands and error codes; and improved visual feedback, including more intuitive light patterns on devices or screen-based feedback.\n\"Hearing loss is not a straight line. There is a lot of fluctuation in both directions\u2014hearing loss can worsen as people age, but hearing aids can also improve over time\u2014so devices need to be able to evolve with the user right in step with these changes,\" said Blair.\nThe researchers suggest recalibrating smart assistant voices through a means similar to how hearing devices are recalibrated by audiologists\u2014to map out the ideal pitch range for individual users.\n\"With improvements, many saw promise in this type of technology to address other accessibility concerns in their daily lives, such as providing assistance in large work meetings or helping them fill in communication gaps when talking to others in loud public spaces,\" said Blair.\nShe concluded, \"Better accommodating the needs of hard-of-hearing\u00a0users could also provide new opportunities for use, such as speech therapy, and speak to the needs of the wider population as they change over time. Making smart assistants more flexible and customizable for one group of users can help improve accessibility for all.\"\nThe work was published in the December 2020 proceedings of the\u00a0ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies\u00a0(IMWUT).\nJessica Hallman is Content and Social Media Manager at Pennsylvania State University College of Information Sciences and Technology.

DOI: 10.1145/3432194.\nWhat Else is New in Hearing & Balance Research\nTwo months after treatment, we saw that some GAPS-treated guinea pigs had a statistically significant increase in new hair cell-like cells compared with controls. Future steps will be to investigate the origin as well as the function of these hair cell-like cells.\nThis work provides a new starting point to investigate the natural triggers of hair cell regeneration in birds. We also identified novel genes that drive hair cell regeneration in the chicken inner ear. These novel genes will be key for investigating their potential role in triggering a change in supporting cells in mammals, in the damaged mouse or human cochlea.\nRight now we are actively recruiting volunteers with hearing loss to participate in an outpatient research study to understand the genes that cause non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss (DFNA).\nThe generosity of our community helped produce significant scientific discoveries this past year.\nTagged: Technology, smart assistants, smartphones, iPhone, Amazon, Alexa, Siri, accessibility, communication, speech therapy\nSign up to receive groundbreaking hearing and balance research updates.\n\u00a9 2024 Hearing Health Foundation.
