        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Every product is carefully selected by our editors. If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission.\nThe Best New Gear, Gadgets and Other Products We Saw at CES 2024\nA lot of cool new tech-related products have been announced at CES 2024. These are our favorites.\nEarlier this year, Apple attempted to steal CES's thunder by announcing the availability of the Vision Pro headset: it'll be up for pre-order on January 19 and available everywhere on February 2. And while it definitely worked, it didn't exactly stop the world's largest electronics show. A bunch of innovative new TVs, laptops, futuristic cars, hi-fi equipment, smart home appliances, wellness devices and all sorts of other gadgets still caught our attention at the show.\nLooking back on the week that was, we're highlighting the coolest new gear and gadgets that were revealed at CES 2024. Check out our favorite products from the show below.\nRabbit R1\nRabbit R1\nThe Rabbit R1 has undoubtedly been one of the stars of this year's CES. It's an adorable AI-powered device (designed in collaboration with Teenage Engineering) that's meant to help you do simple tasks while keeping your smartphone in your pocket. The tiny device also has its own virtual assistant that can help you answer questions, call friends, play music and even do app-based tasks like ordering food or a rideshare.\nPrice: $199Availability: March 2024\nLG Signature OLED T\nLG Signature OLED T\nBy far the most interesting TV announced at CES 2024 was the LG Signature OLED T \u2014 it's the company's first transparent OLED TV (yes, the \"T\" stands for transparent). It's a 77-inch TV with a contrast panel that can raised or lowered with the press of a button. When raised, the OLED T looks like a normal TV. When lowered, it creates this 3D floating effect. The idea is when you're not actually watching TV, you can lower the panel and have custom visuals playing that make it seem like you're looking at a fireplace or a fish tank. The LG Signature OLED T is going to wildly expensive and, if we're being honest, impractical for the vast majority of people ... but we've never seen a TV like it.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: Sometime in 2024\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda has had a sluggish start to the modern electric vehicle era, at least in North America. But at CES 2024, Honda offered us the best preview of what its future will look like in the form of the \"0 Series\" concept cars. The more notable of the two was the 0 Series Saloon, which looks like the Bizzarrini Manta. Believe it or not, Honda says it's coming to North America in 2026, and the company's CEO says the final product will keep \"90 percent\" of the concept's appearance.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2026\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe standout turntable from this year's show was Victrola's Stream Sapphire. It's essentially a way more premium version of the company's Stream Carbon ($699) \u2014 and yes, it also \"Works with Sonos\" so you can wirelessly stream music to your Sonos sound system, no additional components needed.\nThe new model is made of more premium materials, higher-quality components (including a brushless motor and a Ortofon Blue 2M cartridge) and has more advanced streaming capabilities. The Stream Sapphire supports Roon and UPnP and is capable of streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz).\nPrice: $1,499Availability: This spring\nWithings BeamO\nWithings BeamO\nThe BeamO is probably the coolest health and wellness gadget we've seen at this year's show. It's an innovative device that's loaded with sensors for monitoring the health of your heart and lungs, as well as general health with body temperature. Basically, it promises to serve as a thermometer, digital stethoscope, oximeter and EKG that you can use in your home or bring with you on your travels. It's expected to be available this summer (likely June) assuming that it's cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.\nPrice: $250Availability: Likely June\nSony / Honda Afeela\nSony / Honda Afeela\nLast year, Sony unveiled the Afeela concept, an EV designed with Honda that seemed like a flight of fancy \u2013 but the tech brand insisted this follow-up to its 2020 concept car was production-bound. We had our doubts ... until this year, when Sony and Honda brought a revised version of the Afeela to CES that seems much more production-ready. The revised front end has proper headlamps and physical side-view mirrors \u2014 a sure sign of production intent in a concept car these days. The Afeela will use two 241-hp motors for all-wheel-drive, but potential buyers will more likely be excited by the ability to stream movies and play video games in a home theater-like interior.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2026\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro C20\nThe Audio Pro C20 was the standout wireless speaker at CES 2024 because it can just about do it all. It supports Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth streaming. It has an HDMI ARC input so you can use it as a miniature soundbar for your TV, and it has a built-in MM phono stage for connecting a turntable. Throw in the fact that it has a minimalist design (available in three finishes) and it'll probably blend into most folks' existing home decor.\nPrice: $550Availability: February 2024\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a standout 2-in-1 because it's capable of running two operating systems, Android or Windows, and promises to switch seamlessly between the two depending on what mode it's in. When its detachable keyboard is connected and it's in laptop mode, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid runs Windows. When the keyboard is detached, it switches to Android. Pretty cool.\nPrice: $2,000Availability: Q2 2024\nMercedes-Benz G-Class Prototype / EQG\nMercedes-Benz G-Class Prototype / EQG\nMercedes made all sorts of announcements at CES 2024, but many of them were of a rather minor sort \u2014 an improved in-car voice assistant that uses A.I. to behave more naturally, software developed with will.i.am that turns your electric car into a rolling instrument, etc. The quiet show-stopper, though, was an apparent production-ready (or at least near-production-ready) version of the electric G-Class that's been in the works for several years. Based on the gas-guzzling regular G-wagen, it'll pack quad-motor all-wheel-drive and should offer utterly insane off-road capability, without ever using a drop of fuel. It's expected to go on sale before the end of 2024.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2024\nFiiO R9\nFiiO R9\nThe FiiO R9 is an upgraded version of last year's GP100-worthy R7. Like its predecessor, the R9 is an all-in-one desktop hi-fi solution. It's a high-end streaming DAC and headphone amplifier with its own Android operating system and a multitude of wireless and wired connections. The difference with R9 is that it has an improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, improved twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO) and a twice-as-powerful amplifier. It also adds an HDMI ARC port in case you want to connect it to a TV.\nPrice: $1,499Availability: Now\nSupernal S-A2\nSupernal S-A2\nWe've been promised flying cars for about as long as the car has existed, but in spite of many false starts, it's never come to pass. Nevertheless, the next few years may see that dream finally come to fruition ... at least in a manner of speaking, as electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (e-VTOL) crafts finally offer something close to the mix of automotive ease of use and airplane-like flight. Supernal is Hyundai's air mobility division, and the S-A2 is its latest product. The brand says it's only as loud as a dishwasher when taking off, can travel 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet and packs a commute-worthy range of 25 to 40 miles. Thanks to the input of Hyundai design boss Luc Donckerwolke, the S-A2 looks like something George Jetson might take to work ... which makes it close enough to a flying car for us.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2028"

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate. If a company has less than 10 years of experience, it loses points in this category.\nAshburn, VA Window Replacement FAQs\nHow much does a window install cost?\nThe average cost of installing a single window can range between $450 and $650. There are a variety of factors that affect how much it costs, including your property's location, the materials used in designing the windows, how energy-efficient the windows are, local labor costs, styles and sizes of windows and the number of windows.\nWhat are the types of windows?\nThere are several different kinds of windows you can get for your home, including slider windows, double-hung and single-hung windows, picture windows, casement windows, awning windows, bay windows and transom windows.\nDo you really need to use a window installation company?\nYou should hire a window installation company whenever you need to replace your windows. Installing windows is a involved process that can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's best left to the professionals.\nHow do you know it's time to replace your windows?\nWindows typically have a lifespan of around 20 to 30 years, but anytime you notice damage on your windows, it's a good time to have an expert take a look at them to see if they need any repairs or replacements.\nShould I replace my windows all at once?\nIf your windows are more than 20 years old, it's probably time to replace all of them. By that point, they are usually less efficient, leakier and/or more damaged than new windows. Replacing your windows all at the same time will involve less paperwork and less time.\nOther Services in Ashburn\nMore window replacement & installers Near Me"

As businesses began to use the Internet in the 1990s, telecommunications carriers (e.g., AT&T) established networks, known as backbones, to satisfy increasing demand for higher data rates. This Internet infrastructure grew into a \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d run by several telecommunications carriers, each of which managed its own backbone.\nThese backbones needed to connect to one another, or \u201cpeer\u201d, to permit their customers to exchange data and communicate with each other. As a result, many backbone providers agreed to exchange large volumes of data traffic through a limited number of centralized public network access points (NAPs) \u2013 as shown below \u2013 one of which was known as MAE-East.\nMAE-East was the first large NAP and internet exchange point (IXP), establishing locations in Washington, D.C., as well as the Northern Virginia sub-markets of Vienna, Reston, and Ashburn. Early on, it was estimated that over 50% of the world\u2019s Internet traffic flowed through MAE-East, given its role of interconnecting traffic between internet service providers (ISPs).\nIn turn, a large concentration of data centers began forming in Northern Virginia to process enormous amounts of data for large Internet and technology companies such as AOL, Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft.\nUltimately, NAPs like MAE-East were unable to scale with the growth of the Internet. Consequently, interconnection hubs, such as Equinix\u2019s carrier-neutral DC2 data center in Ashburn, Virginia, formed peering exchanges in close proximity to MAE-East.\nToday, Equinix\u2019s Ashburn, Virginia data center campus acts as a center of connectivity for Northern Virginia, sustaining the market\u2019s importance.\nREAD MORE: Cross Connects \u2013 Interconnection Services in Data Centers\nNorthern Virginia\u2019s power costs, which average between $0.06 to $0.07 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), are 25%+ below the national average in the United States. In particular, the region\u2019s power costs compare favorably to alternate East Coast data center markets like New York and Northern New Jersey.\nAt the same time, the supply of power is abundant in Northern Virginia, with the main utility company, Dominion Energy, having a track record of reliably distributing power as data center demand grows. Since 2019, Dominion Energy has connected nearly 70 data centers with over 2,600 megawatts of capacity in Northern Virginia, which is equivalent to over 650,000 residential homes.\nNorthern Virginia\u2019s density and diversity of dark fiber routes provide low-latency connections to the national fiber network or \u201cInternet\u201d backbone. Dark fiber has become critically important as network speed and bandwidth demands have increased, driven by the growth in applications and services such as video streaming and cloud computing.\nREAD MORE: Dark Fiber and Enterprise Fiber Connect The Global Network\nBelow is an example of SummitIG\u2019s dark fiber network map in Northern Virginia, which highlights the company\u2019s particularly dense dark fiber concentrations in the sub-markets of Ashburn, Sterling, and Manassas, Virginia.\nFiber optic networks take time, expertise, and significant capital to build, meaning that Northern Virginia\u2019s existing dark fiber connectivity is difficult to replicate.\nAdditionally, the East Coast of Virginia, particularly Virginia Beach, is becoming a key subsea cable landing point, supporting international telecommunications traffic.\nREAD MORE: Submarine Cables \u2013 the Invisible Fiber Link Enabling the Internet\nPresently, subsea cables including BRUSA (Telxius / Telef\u00f3nica), Dunant (Google), and MAREA (Facebook/Meta, Microsoft) terminate in the United States at Virginia Beach. While Confluence-1 and South Atlantic Express (SAex) are two examples of subsea cables planning to land in Virginia Beach in 2023 and 2024.\nAs shown above, long-haul terrestrial dark fiber routes connect Virginia Beach, via Richmond, with Northern Virginia. In turn, colocation data centers in Ashburn, Virginia can support international networking needs by providing access to Virginia Beach\u2019s growing subsea cable hub.\nREAD MORE: Colocation \u2013 Definition, Meaning, Data Center, Services\nNorthern Virginia boasts a low probability and risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes. To this end, the market experiences very limited seismic activity and is far enough inland to avoid the full force of hurricanes.\nNorthern Virginia is considered both the \u201cInternet\u201d and \u201cdata center\u201d capital of the world with its significant concentration of network service providers, colocation data centers, and cloud service providers (CSPs). The region acts as the center of connectivity for the East Coast of the United States and the main on-ramp for cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.\nREAD MORE: Top 10 Cloud Service Providers Globally in 2023\nTax abatements promote data center expansion in Northern Virginia. For example, during fiscal year 2021, the state of Virginia abated $124.5 million of retail sales and use taxes for data centers. Specifically, this tax abatement relates to the purchase or lease of computer equipment (e.g., servers) and enabling software/hardware for use in a data center.\nAdditionally, Northern Virginia\u2019s Loudoun County and Prince William County have facilitated a prioritized review of data center development opportunities (e.g., Loudoun\u2019s Fast-Track Commercial Incentive Program) and shorter permitting approval timelines. For example, as a target industry of Prince William County, data center projects can expect a \u201c50% reduction in permit review time\u201d.\nWhy is Northern Virginia a Data Center Hub?\nNorthern Virginia is a data center hub because it is the ideal location for large-scale, known as \u201chyperscale\u201d, computing and storage deployments, while being the focal point for private data transfer and public Internet traffic exchange on the East Coast of the United States.\nAs such, Northern Virginia\u2019s data center market has become a \u201chub\u201d for telecommunications carriers, mobile network operators, cloud service providers (CSPs), over-the-top (OTT) media service companies, large enterprises, and government agencies.\nREAD MORE: Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft Data Centers in Virginia\nVirginia (VA) is the Internet capital of the world because data centers operating in Virginia currently move 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic daily, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP).\nThis notion was also supported by Bill Stein, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Realty, who stated on the company\u2019s Q2 2018 conference call that \u201cin North America, new data centers are popping up across the primary data center metros, especially in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world and through which more than 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic passes every day\u201d.\nAs a result, commonly asked questions including How Much of the World\u2019s Internet Goes through Ashburn, Virginia? and How Much of the World\u2019s Data Goes through Ashburn, Virginia? typically also yield the 70% figure as an answer.\nHowever, independent analysis conducted by TeleGeography, pegs the proportion of the world\u2019s internet traffic flowing through Northern Virginia at a much lower level \u2013 between a range of 30% and 40%.\nNevertheless, even if Northern Virginia were to command only 30% of the world\u2019s internet traffic, this would still place the region as the \u201cInternet Capital of the World\u201d.\nNorthern Virginia is the data center capital of the world because it comprises the largest concentration of data centers globally. Within Northern Virginia, the majority of data centers are located in Loudoun County, which is known as \u201cData Center Alley\u201d, led by its most important sub-market, Ashburn.\nWhy are There So Many Data Centers in Ashburn, Virginia?\nIn Ashburn, Virginia, there are so many data centers because of the region\u2019s history as a network access point (NAP), cost-effective & abundant power, dense network connectivity, low risk of natural disasters, rich ecosystem of network & cloud providers, and tax & permitting incentives for data center development. Indeed, these are the same reasons which have brought data centers to the Northern Virginia region as a whole.\nBelow is satellite imagery depicting a significant concentration of data centers in Ashburn, Virginia (VA).\nAshburn, Virginia is the center of the Internet because a significant portion of the world\u2019s internet traffic passes through its data centers daily. The most notable of these data centers is Equinix\u2019s Ashburn, Virginia (VA) campus:\nIn July 1999, Equinix opened its first carrier-neutral data center, known as DC1, located in Ashburn, Virginia. This was closely followed by the opening of its DC2 data center, also in 1999, located at 21715 Filigree Court in Ashburn, Virginia \u2013 which is currently the most important interconnection hub on the East Coast of the United States.\nIn the early 2000s, Equinix\u2019s Ashburn, Virginia data center campus became a key internet exchange point (IXP) for internet infrastructure companies (e.g., AT&T), internet service providers (e.g., Comcast), second-tier backbones (e.g., Global Crossing), international telecommunications carriers (e.g., British Telecom), fiber/Ethernet providers (e.g., Cogent Communications), and incumbent local exchange carriers (e.g., Verizon), to interconnect with each other and their customers.\nAs a result, Ashburn as a market and Equinix\u2019s campus quickly became a concentrated point for peering. In turn, the ecosystem of companies drawn to Ashburn created a network effect, fueling the growth and value proposition of Equinix\u2019s campus and cementing Ashburn, Virginia as the center of the Internet.\nPresently, Equinix\u2019s Ashburn, Virginia data center campus now spans DC1 to DC15, as well as DC21, and counts over 400 \u201cparticipants\u201d \u2013 meaning telecommunications carriers, internet service providers (ISPs), cloud platforms, IT service providers, and more.\nData Center Relocation: Moving Facilities and Servers\nModular Data Centers: Prefabricated Containers and Modules\nData Center Decommissioning: Streamlining IT Infrastructure\nData Center Managed Services: A Comprehensive Guide\nData Center Consolidation: Streamlining Facilities and Servers\nTypes of Data Centers: Enterprise, Colocation, Hyperscale\nLEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nWhat is a Cell Tower?
