With a successful track record developing automotive and in-flight IVI systems, ICS was poised to create a striking demo that would showcase the power of the AGL platform and turn heads at CES.\nDesigning an Engaging UX/UI\nTo stand apart from the 300+ vehicle tech exhibitors at CES, AGL requested a fresh, modern look and feel, and intuitive navigation that would present well on the specified 7-inch portrait-mode, 8 GB Raspberry Pi touchscreen hardware. In order to highlight AGL\u2019s capabilities, ICS\u2019 design team focused on creating a user interface (UI) with heightened visceral appeal and supporting the development team, which concentrated on building working integrations for key screens, including Home, HVAC, Media Player, Settings and Apps.\nThe design leans heavily on informative visual elements that possess visceral appeal. For instance, clever animations and micro-animations ensure that whatever task a \u201cdriver\u201d executes \u2013 from cranking up the tunes to turning down the air conditioning \u2013 they\u2019re met with immediate visual feedback so they feel confident their request was carried out. Touching a button elicits a change in color or shape. A subtle undulating background texture conveys a feeling of depth to the screen, providing feedback similar to what users expect when pressing a mechanical button.\nDeveloping with Flutter\nFlutter is an open source framework from Google used for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. Always a trailblazer, Toyota is the first Tier 1 automaker to adopt Flutter for embedded IVI development.\nTake a Look Under the Hood\nThe software stack ICS built for the demo combines AGL\u2019s reference platform, a Linux-based distribution that prioritizes open-source software components, Wayland communication protocol for UI rendering and interaction, Flutter for front-end development, and RiverPod, a reactive caching framework for Flutter/Dart, for state management and communication with the underlying hardware and services.\nFlutter UI and front end: UI and front-end components were built with Flutter v.3.13.2. RiverPod handles state management and acts as a mediator to synchronize the front-end and back-end logic. When state changes occur in the UI, signals are dispatched to RiverPod objects/providers, which relay these updates to the hardware. Communication is achieved via gRPC and Protobuf, which facilitate interactions with a Kuksa databroker server. Complex graphics and animations are supported by both RiverPod and Lottie, a JSON-based animation file format that allows developers to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets.\nPlatform interface: The UI is built on Wayland, a protocol for a compositor (in this case an agl-compositor built upon Weston, which manages the displays) to talk to its clients. The UI also employs Wayland\u2019s IVI extension, which extends Wayland's capabilities to facilitate tasks like window positioning that are not supported by the core Wayland protocol.\nApplication integration: Applications within the system utilize the IVI protocol to communicate with the compositor and display their content. Flutter applications are integrated into this environment using the meta-flutter Yocto layer. The key component responsible for this integration is the flutter-app.inc code, which manages the inclusion of all dependencies listed in the project's pubspec files and bundles them within the application.\nRuntime execution: At runtime, the bundled Flutter application is compiled or interpreted by the selected Flutter embedder. Two implementations exist in the layer: a Sony embedder that supports both X11 and Wayland; and a Toyota embedder called flutter-auto, which serves as the default option.\nThe Future of IVI\nThe IVI demo is a showstopper that delivers on multiple fronts \u2013 not only does it spotlight AGL\u2019s platform and ICS\u2019 design and development expertise, but also Toyota\u2019s bold choice to lead the industry in embracing open source Flutter for embedded development. We expect the demo to create a loud buzz at the show and beyond!\nSee the demo for yourself at CES.

Many of the world\u2019s biggest automakers will be there, and they\u2019ll be showing off more than new electric or self-driving cars. The technology inside our cars for music, infotainment, and GPS is also a big part of story. Especially with consumers expecting their \u201cconnected\u201d car experience to be as glitzy, convenient, simple and easy to upgrade as their smart phone or wearable.\nWhile some car companies are partnering with Google on self-driving cars for the future, there\u2019s also a major shift taking place that provides a tremendous opportunity and demand for Linux and an open ecosystem that invites industry-wide collaboration.\nThe Linux Foundation Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) Collaborative Project is kicking off CES with two major announcements that show car makers are embracing open development and code.\nWith four new major automotive OEMs stepping up to join the project (see announcement here), AGL is well-positioned to quickly become the de facto standard for automotive. Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Subaru as well as Ford, the first U.S. auto maker to join AGL, are committing to an open ecosystem and a common platform to accelerate rapid innovation. They see a clear benefit to working alongside other AGL members like auto suppliers, communications and semiconductor companies and collaborating directly with our global community of developers to advance the software for connected car applications. But even more important, it\u2019s a clear indication that carmakers are embracing an open source development methodology that has been highly successful in other markets.\nThanks in part to new member resources, several members upgrading their membership levels and very active collaboration and development, we already have a major new release to announce as well. Our new AGL Unified Code Base (UCB) distribution leverages the best software components from AGL and other existing open source projects such as Tizen and GENIVI Alliance.\nAt CES, the AGL UCB will be featured as part of the GENIVI CES 2016 Demonstration Showcase in the Trump International Hotel on January 6-7, 2016. Demo applications for navigation, HVAC control, radio, media player and browser, settings and home screen are on display this week.\nThis new distribution integrates the best components from AGL, Tizen, GENIVI and related open source code into a single AGL Unified Code Base, allowing carmakers to leverage a common platform for rapid innovation.\nAlready several members of AGL, including Toyota, Aisin AW, DENSO, Fujitsu Ten, HARMAN, Panasonic, Pioneer and Renesas Electronics are planning to use the AGL Unified Code Base distribution to deliver a modern in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and connected car experience for consumers.\nThe AGL UCB distribution will play a huge role in the adoption of Linux-based systems for all functions in the vehicle too. Although initially focused on IVI, the new distribution has been architected to allow different profiles to be created from the same code base to address all applications in the car, such as instrument cluster, heads up display, telematics and connected car.\nThe automotive industry needs a standard open operating system and framework to enable automakers and suppliers to quickly bring these smart phone-like capabilities to the car. Auto OEMs are also are not willing to cede control of their display technology, embedded systems and data to a single software technology company. So don\u2019t be surprised if the Linux penguin laps the competition in the automotive industry this year.\nTo read more about the Automotive Grade Linux or get involved, please visit: https://www.automotivelinux.org/.\nDan Cauchy is General Manager, Automotive Grade Linux at The Linux Foundation.\n2023\nCompliance and Security\nCloud Computing\nProjects\nLinux How-To\nDiversity & Inclusion\nOpen Source Best Practices\nOpen Source\n2022\nCross Technology\nTraining and Certification\nLFX\nNewsletter\nLegal\nResearch\n2024\nLF Research\nNetworking and Edge\nBlog\nData Governance\nFeatured\nLF Energy\nLinux Foundation\nOpen Mainframe\nOpenChain\nSystem Administration\nlicense compliance\ntechtalentsurvey\nStay Connected with the Linux Foundation\nABOUT THE LINUX FOUNDATION\nThe Linux Foundation provides a neutral, trusted hub for developers to code, manage, and scale open technology projects.\nPROJECTS\nNEWSROOM\nLF RESEARCH\nLFX PLATFORM\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nLF TRAINING\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Linux Foundation\u00ae.
