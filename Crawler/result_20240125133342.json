See our ethics statement.\nWe tried Brandenburg Labs\u2019 spatial audio, and here's why it's better\nBrandenburg Labs, led by MP3 co-inventor Prof. Dr.-Ing. Karlheinz Brandenburg unveiled its latest Audio Augmented Reality Headphone System at CES 2024. Their proprietary software departs from traditional spatial audio solutions by integrating pre-recorded room data and VR-like head tracking to simulate a more immersive virtual listening experience.\nTrue spatial audio?\nTraditional spatial audio solutions try to make sounds feel like they\u2019re coming from all around you, just like in real life. In fact, many headsets now feature head-tracking capabilities that pan your music based on your head position relative to the source device. Companies like Bose and Apple achieve this by including an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in their headsets. This sensor typically contains a gyroscope and accelerometer. The data gathered from the IMU can then be used to calculate where your head is facing, allowing your headphones\u2019 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to adjust the sound accordingly. But it\u2019s not perfect; sometimes, there\u2019s a delay with the head tracking, or the adjustments from your headphones\u2019 DSP may sound \u201coff.\u201d\nHowever, Brandenburg Labs\u2019 new system adds a new twist. They\u2019ve created a system that understands where your head is and knows the specific layout of your room. It utilizes HTC Vive base station sensors that scan the room and keep tabs on your headset\u2019s position and movement. This means the sound you hear is super precise, as it adjusts based on your location within the room.\nWe had the chance to test a comparison demo at CES 2024, where we compared the virtual sound of loudspeakers to real ones, and the difference between the two was nearly indistinguishable. When placing the headset on your head, the audio sounds just the same as it was coming out of the speakers. Aside from the physical sensation of the weight of the headphones, you would have no idea that the sound source has changed from the speakers to the headphones.\nWhile this sounds awesome, there\u2019s a bit of a catch. This advanced setup relies on external HTC Vive sensors and a scanned room model to work its magic. So, it\u2019s not something you can just pop on your head and take anywhere like regular headphones. Changing surroundings, like walking outside, would throw off the accuracy. That said, future incorporation into VR/AR headsets could bring this technology into the home.\nThough we\u2019re not quite there yet for on-the-go use, this technology from Brandenburg Labs is a big step forward. It\u2019s making sound more realistic and immersive, pushing the boundaries of what we thought headphones could do. As technology evolves, who knows? One day, you might be able to enjoy this super accurate spatial audio wherever you go. But for now, it\u2019s an exciting development for audio professionals and future home entertainment settings."

Karlheinz Brandenburg Unveils Audio AR Headphone System Creates Immersive Audio Quality for a Real-Life Spatial Experience\nShare story:\nBrandenburg Labs Introduces First Truly Immersive Audio Augmented Reality Headphone System At CES 2024\nA story by Brandenburg Labs GmbH\nPublished on 01/03/2024\nBrandenburg Labs GmbH\nThe vision of Brandenburg Labs is to connect the digital and real world through immersive audio and unlock the full potential of human hearing. Therefore, the start-up company creates immersive audio experiences for headphones, as intuitive as real life. This enables everyone to dive deep into any soundscape. Brandenburg Labs, established in 2019 in Ilmenau, Germany, was founded by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Karlheinz Brandenburg, best known as co-inventor of the mp3 format. As a spin-off of the Ilmenau University of Technology and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology, Brandenburg Labs can draw on many years of research in the field of audio at these and other institutions.\nWith its talented interdisciplinary team, Brandenburg Labs tackles the challenges of creating an immersive audio experience for headphones. The proof-of-concept system has gained recognition from over 700 audio experts at conferences and conventions worldwide, surpassing other commercially available systems. Leveraging this innovative technology, Brandenburg Labs brings immersive audio solutions and products to the market, that enhance digital life. Our technology recreates real acoustic environments or generates new realistic listening environments, seamlessly integrating virtual sounds into users' lives. Soon, we will offer headphone-based solutions for various industries, such as music production, Augmented Reality, virtual prototyping, audio guides, and gaming. Our primary goal is to introduce immersive audio to the consumer headphone market, enabling individuals to explore complete soundscapes, opening up the third dimension of headphone audio. To achieve this, Brandenburg Labs collaborates with partners and hardware manufacturers.\nSubscribe to PresseMail\nReceive current and relevant stories sent to your e-mail address every day free of charge.

This remarkable event took place from the 4th to the 8th of December at the International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney), Australia.\nThe convention encompassed a diverse array of acoustics topics, spanning animals, architectural, underwater, and psycho-acoustics. Engaging with fellow audio and acoustics enthusiasts at various social events allowed for valuable networking opportunities. Notably, the welcoming reception and conference jam session in a Sydney jazz club created a delightful atmosphere for the four-day convention.\nDuring the event, Prof. Brandenburg, presented a paper titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High Quality Low Complexity Binaural Rendering for Headphones.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The paper discusses the long-standing research topic of immersive audio playback via headphones, focusing on binaural rendering systems. These systems consider room characteristics, transmission path, and head-related transfer functions.\nThe paper introduces a low-complexity rendering system that achieves high-quality binaural reproduction, addressing challenges such as real-time head tracking and room acoustic information without needing individualized HRTFs. Early this year, we conducted a \u00c2\u00a0listening test and gathered reviews, demonstrating that the perceived audio signals from our system are equivalent to listening to real audio sources in a room.\nDuring our visit to Sydney, we seized the opportunity to visit the National Facility for Human-Robot Interaction Research (HRI) at the University of Sydney, courtesy of an invitation from Glenn Dickins of Dickins Audio.\nThis acoustically treated room, equipped with 156 speakers and 128 microphones, serves both as a research facility and a space for students to create music productions. Learn more about Dickins Audio: https://lnkd.in/evY3uJzd\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the Australian Acoustical Society and the Acoustical Society of America for organizing this outstanding event that brought together audio enthusiasts from across the globe.\n#BrandenburgLabs #KarlheinzBrandenburg #Acoustics2023Sydney #InternationalConvention #DeepDiveAudio #Acoustics #TechStartup #audioengineering\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n890 followers\nExplore topics"
