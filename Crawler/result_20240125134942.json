As a result, Blink chargers, the Blink Network, and Blink\u2019s turnkey services were made available to all 323 Mitsubishi dealerships nationwide. This impactful agreement represented just one of the Company\u2019s many collaborations throughout 2023, augmented by a successful $100 million capital raise in January that kicked off Blink\u2019s impressive year.\nAs February rolled around and American football\u2019s finest made their way to Phoenix for the big game, Blink teamed up with Hertz to provide complimentary EV charging to Hertz customers visiting the Phoenix area for the event.\nMarch saw one of Blink\u2019s most impactful announcements to date. The Company proudly announced its contract with the United States Postal Service to provide up to 41,500 EV charging stations and network services for USPS\u2019s electric future.

Mr. Jones, the newly appointed President and CEO, soon oversaw a significant announcement at the end of June showcasing Blink\u2019s position as an EV infrastructure industry leader in incorporating NACS (North American Charging Standard) into the Company\u2019s entire product line. This made Blink one of the first to adapt to and embrace the industry shift.\nContinuing the Company\u2019s mission to support EV drivers at home and on the road, Blink signed an agreement with AAA in July to offer electric vehicle products to affiliated roadside service providers nationwide. The deal includes Blink\u2019s Mobile Charger, of which AAA was an early adopter.\nBlink has proven its readiness to support major global companies\u2019 charge into the EV future \u2013 as\u00a0 the Company did in August, when it signed an agreement with global quick service franchisee, Arcos Dorados, to provide EV charging to five McDonald\u2019s locations throughout Puerto Rico. The Company\u2019s global vision for an electrified future continued to make headlines in 2023 including when, in October, Blink announced that Blue Corner, acquired in 2021, would now operate as Blink Charging, positioning the Blink brand for further expansion in Europe.\nFinally, one of the standout highlights of this past year was the Company\u2019s announcement of its record-breaking revenue in third quarter (Q3) \u2013 surpassing its previous record-breaking second quarter (Q2). These achievements are indicative of Blink\u2019s drive toward operational and financial performance excellence.\n###\nAbout Blink Charging\nBlink Charging Co.

        "raw_content": "Blink introduces seven new charging products at CES including plug & charge and V2G technology\nEV charging network, Blink, kicked off this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) by sharing news of seven new charging products, the largest unveiling in its thirteen year history. Blink products include multiple versions of fleet and home chargers, as well as new public chargers and software for customers.\nBlink Charging Co. ($BLNK) is an international EV charging network operating over 30,000 ports across thirteen different countries. In addition to charging hardware and services, the Blink Network uses proprietary, cloud-based software that operates and tracks charging stations connected to its network and the charging data they provide.\nBlink charging\u2019s strategy promotes mass EV adoption by supporting EV drivers with charging solutions everywhere, whether its at home, work, a public station, or even a fleet depot.\nIn mid-December, Blink teased an upcoming suite of new charging products to be unveiled at this years Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. With its latest announcement coinciding with CES, we now have a first glimpse at seven new charging solutions from Blink.\nBlink introduces largest suite of charging solutions to date\nWhile the public will not get to enter CES 2022 until January 5th, we were able to get a first look at Blink\u2019s new charging products early, and it\u2019s quite a haul.\nThe first new charging product is the HQ 200, Blink\u2019s next generation of home chargers. The 50 amp charger comes in two models \u2013 The HQ 200 basic and the HQ 200 Smart, which is also Wi-Fi enabled. Both versions feature Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology allowing you to send energy back to your home or grid with the proper electrical setup.\nThe new charger also features load sharing capabilities, meaning multiple EV\u2019s can charge at your home on one circuit. With a NEMA Type 3R plug and a lockable SAE J1772\ncharger, installation should be relatively easy.\nA commercial counter to the HQ 200 is the MQ 200, a similar 50 amp charger designed for fleet and multi-unit applications, offering charge rates of 9.6 kW.\u00a0This charger features fully-integrated a fleet management portal (more below), and local load management across two or more chargers.\nWhat\u2019s most interesting about the MQ 200 is its Plug & Charge capability, allowing for the charging station to identify an EV and its encrypted account through the plug itself, alleviating the need for an app or charge card.\nBlink\u2019s new public chargers and software solutions\nIn addition to the private chargers listed above, Blink has introduced two new public charging solutions. The first is the DC Wall 50 kW charger, a compact and lightweight DC fast charger that can be easily installed on a wall or as a pedestal.\nThis new DCFC features 150 amps of output and V2G technology, and can charge two EVs simultaneously through its CCS ports. Unfortunately, the DC Wall Charger doesn\u2019t come with Plug & Charge, so a member card, RFID credit card, or mobile app is required.\nBlink\u2019s new Vision IQ 200 will combine EV fast charging with ads on either one or two 30\u2033 LCD screens, offering revenue shares for both charging and advertising. The Vision IQ 200 is equipped with one or two 80-amp Level 2 chargers delivering up to 19.2 kW charge speeds, plus 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nIn addition to new hardware, Blink has also introduced new software solutions for its customers. This includes a Fleet Management Portal which offers fleet managers a new dashboard to track EV charging and load management, charger status, as well as the status of vehicles and drivers. The real-time tracking should help future fleets run at their most efficient pace.\nLastly, the company will introduce a new Blink Mobile App designed to make both public and home charging easier. Customers can find public chargers nearby, reserve their spot, and save their favorites for easy access. At home, Blink customers can control their charger from anywhere and schedule charges to take advantage of off-peak hours.\nBlink will officially unveil these products during a press conference live at CES on January 5th at 11:15AM PST.

(NASDAQ: BLNK) (\u201cBlink\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading global manufacturer, owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, reflects upon a record-breaking year that saw record growth, new opportunities, and remarkable achievements for the Company.\nBlink began 2023 on a high note by unveiling an exclusive agreement with Mitsubishi to implement EV charging infrastructure across Mitsubishi\u2019s nationwide dealer network. As a result, Blink chargers, the Blink Network, and Blink\u2019s turnkey services were made available to all 323 Mitsubishi dealerships nationwide. This impactful agreement represented just one of the Company\u2019s many collaborations throughout 2023, augmented by a successful $100 million capital raise in January that kicked off Blink\u2019s impressive year.\nAs February rolled around and American football\u2019s finest made their way to Phoenix for the big game, Blink teamed up with Hertz to provide complimentary EV charging to Hertz customers visiting the Phoenix area for the event.\nMarch saw one of Blink\u2019s most impactful announcements to date. The Company proudly announced its contract with the United States Postal Service to provide up to 41,500 EV charging stations and network services for USPS\u2019s electric future. Along with its other accomplishments, this significant achievement allows the Company to continue contributing to the construction of the necessary EV infrastructure crucial for advancing transportation electrification nationwide.\nWith a holistic perspective on electrification\u2019s requirements and potential, Blink\u2019s decision in April to acquire the EV car-sharing company, Envoy Technologies, Inc, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Blink Mobility, was driven by the vision for the future of e-mobility.\nIn May, Blink announced the Company\u2019s leadership would be entrusted to EV industry veteran and then Blink President, Brendan Jones. Mr. Jones, the newly appointed President and CEO, soon oversaw a significant announcement at the end of June showcasing Blink\u2019s position as an EV infrastructure industry leader in incorporating NACS (North American Charging Standard) into the Company\u2019s entire product line. This made Blink one of the first to adapt to and embrace the industry shift.\nContinuing the Company\u2019s mission to support EV drivers at home and on the road, Blink signed an agreement with AAA in July to offer electric vehicle products to affiliated roadside service providers nationwide. The deal includes Blink\u2019s Mobile Charger, of which AAA was an early adopter.\nBlink has proven its readiness to support major global companies\u2019 charge into the EV future \u2013 as the Company did in August, when it signed an agreement with global quick service franchisee, Arcos Dorados, to provide EV charging to five McDonald\u2019s locations throughout Puerto Rico. The Company\u2019s global vision for an electrified future continued to make headlines in 2023 including when, in October, Blink announced that Blue Corner, acquired in 2021, would now operate as Blink Charging, positioning the Blink brand for further expansion in Europe.\nFinally, one of the standout highlights of this past year was the Company\u2019s announcement of its record-breaking revenue in third quarter (Q3) \u2013 surpassing its previous record-breaking second quarter (Q2). These achievements are indicative of Blink\u2019s drive toward operational and financial performance excellence.\n###\nAbout Blink Charging\nBlink Charging Co.
