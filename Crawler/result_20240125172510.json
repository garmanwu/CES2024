Zoox also offered an exclusive opportunity to CES attendees to join its early-bird waitlist and be among the first to sign up for its autonomous ride hailing service.\nIn 2023, we introduced new tools that would make it easier and faster for developers to use generative AI to build conversational experiences with Alexa. Starting today, customers can try some of these new developer-built experiences for themselves.\nWith Character.ai, Alexa customers can have just-for-fun conversations with different Characters\u2014including getting motivated with fitness coaches, gaining insight from historical figures such as Socrates, receiving book recommendations from Librarian Linda, playing RPGs with Text Adventure Game, and more.\nSplash is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology with Alexa.

Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "As streaming shatters, here\u2019s how Amazon wants to glue it back together with AI\nGood news, everyone! Amazon already has tipped its hand as to what\u2019s in store for Fire TV in 2024. At least, some of what\u2019s in store.\nFlashback to September 2023 at its fall products announcements at HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia, when Amazon showed off new hardware with new features \u2014 specifically, the refreshed Fire TV Stick Max 4K and along with it, the latest Ambient Experience. Good stuff, all around.\nThat\u2019s on the hardware side of things. Software is always improving, and Amazon said these major features are coming in the first quarter of 2024:\nTwo of those things directly relate to the major leaps in AI processing that Amazon (and others) put front and center in 2023. And in this case, we, as end users, will get to leverage them in early 2024. And that\u2019s just the stuff we know about. (A third new feature, the ability for apps to be included in the \u201cContinue watching\u201d row of the home screen, is already available, but look for more apps to be included in the future.)\nWe chatted about all that with Joshua Danovitz, Director of Fire TV Experience at Amazon. And then some.\nBetter search through AI\nIf it seems like every tech company in the world cares more about large language models than anything else these days, you\u2019re not necessarily wrong. Or, at the very least, LLMs have quickly gained a more prominent place in public-facing features. And that\u2019s going to be extremely apparent in the search results you get when using Amazon Fire TV. We got a taste of that at Amazon\u2019s September event, and we\u2019ll get to try it ourselves early in 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already are very good at helping customers when they know what they want to watch,\u201d Danovitz said before throwing out some examples. \u201cFind me Tom Cruise movies. Show me comedies or rom-com movies. Or if you know the name of the title. Easy. We\u2019re very good at that.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a basic search \u2014 table stakes for a company like Amazon in 2023. The edge cases \u2014 where you don\u2019t necessarily know what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 are more tricky. And that\u2019s what all this \u201cAI search\u201d stuff is trying to address. And it\u2019s doing so in a way that\u2019s less mechanical and more like how you\u2019d ask a human being.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with LLM,\u201d Danovitz continued, \u201cis making it so that you\u2019re able to have an interaction and then a multi-turn, almost conversational style, when you don\u2019t really know (what it is you\u2019re looking for).\u201d\nThose of us of a certain age can recall what it was like to go into a video rental store and run a real-time search. With a person.\n\u201cIf you if you rewind 20 years, you go into your local video store and say things like, \u2018Hey, what was the movie where somebody was, you know, stuck in a submarine?\u2019 You know where you\u2019re trying to go, but you don\u2019t actually remember all the details. That\u2019s the type of thing that the LLM search will help with.\u201d\nAmazon Fire TV search results should be even better in 2024.\nRefining results is another major use case of LLM-powered search, Danovitz said.\n\u201cThe next thing will happen is when you don\u2019t know exactly what the title is, but you\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, I would like to find cartoon movies with dinosaurs. But just the free ones.\u2019 Today, that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re able to provide.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all about simplifying things for those of us who are just trying to watch something, especially in a space as fragmented \u2014 and as ever-changing \u2014 as streaming.\n\u201cDiscovery of video is a journey, and it\u2019s hard today,\u201d Danovitz said. \u201cLike, to be honest, I think that one of the trends that is often talked about is consolidation of content, how it\u2019s getting moved around. It\u2019s becoming harder for customers. We used to think it was getting harder with, you know, hundreds of cable channels or the first few streaming apps. It\u2019s actually getting more complicated with all of the different bundles, name changes, pricing changes move to different tiers.\u201d\nExpand the Ambient Experience\nThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the first device outside of the Omni QLED line of Fire TVs to include the Ambient Experience. In 2024, we hope to see Ambient Experience come to additional Fire TV devices because it\u2019s just that good.\nSaid Danovitz: \u201cThis was the first time that we decided, like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s not just do it on televisions with sensors, let\u2019s do it on a device that doesn\u2019t have a sensor \u2014 a stick \u2014 because it\u2019s a very different way that customers interact.\u2019 \u201d\nOf course, this isn\u2019t quite as simple as it sounds, and there\u2019s a reason that Ambient Experience wasn\u2019t initially rolled out across the greater Fire TV lineup. And that reason wasn\u2019t just to sell more 4K Max sticks.\n\u201cSome of ambient is more processor-intensive,\u201d Danovitz said. \u201cSome of it uses more AI, some of it uses connection to other services and back end. And so it definitely can be per hardware device.\u201d\nSoftware is always at the mercy of the hardware on which it runs. And Danovitz wouldn\u2019t say if we could expect Ambient Experience on more existing hardware \u2014 you\u2019d have to believe the Fire TV Cube probably is powerful enough \u2014 or if we\u2019ll have to wait for new hardware updates that would require users to purchase anew. But we can, at least, expect the current implementation of Ambient Experience to improve.\nThe Ambient Experience is still limited to just two classes of Fire TV device \u2014 for now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of very good feedback from customers directly,\u201d Danovitz said. \u201cBut also, like, even on our home page where people are interacting with it. So it\u2019s really exciting, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in additional ambient features and [user experience] to actually get to the feature as well.\u201d\nThe Omni QLED televisions have onboard sensors to detect if someone is in the room and within sight of the TV before triggering the Ambient Experience features. Fire TV sticks don\u2019t have that. But they can talk to other devices via APIs, like, say, from something in the Amazon Echo family, the Ring doorbell, or possibly even the Eero family of wireless routers. And that could potentially give the Fire TV Ambient Experience more data as to whether someone is in the room or not.\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually lots of interesting things that you can do with other sensors in your house,\u201d Danovitz said. \u201cWe actually have lots of interactions from customers that could be helpful for television interaction as well. \u2026 Are there other ways to understand when there\u2019s someone there or when you should trigger something? We\u2019re exploring some of that.\u201d\nAI art is coming\nAnother fun feature we\u2019re waiting on is AI art. The demo Amazon\u2019s Daniel Rausch showed at the September event seemed simple enough and not unlike what any number of phone apps have done \u2014 take your images, run them through some AI processing, and output something new. Something more artsy.\nRight now, Danovitz said, the focus is on some of the core features. \u201cLike, I\u2019m having a dinner party, and I want there to be artwork or something cute that I\u2019m going to create on my own.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cthe most important thing for us to demonstrate to customers.\u201d\nOf course, that\u2019s fraught with danger because people are people and will test the limits of what Amazon is willing to create with user-generated content. We\u2019ll have to see how far out those boundaries lie. But for folks just looking to create something new \u2014 without trying to cause any scandal in the process \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a cool feature.\nNew hardware in 2024\nSomething Danovitz definitely (and understandably) wouldn\u2019t get into was any new Fire TV hardware coming in 2024. But given the cadence of product releases, it really shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone to see something new coming down the pike from the Fire TV team. The question is what and when.\nOnly the top end of the Fire TV Stick lineup was refreshed in September 2023 \u2014 the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and the non-Max version. These impending updates helped lift the Fire TV Stick 4K Max to become the most innovative streaming device released this past year.\nOf course new hardware is likely in 2024.\nLooking further down the line, the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite were last refreshed in 2020. They\u2019re likely due for updates, which would refresh the bottom end of the line. The Fire TV Cube is a tougher call. It got new hardware in late 2022, but it\u2019s hard to say that it sits atop the lineup at this point, given all that\u2019s in the Fire TV Stick 4K Max now, including Ambient Experience, which the Cube lacks.\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll have to buy new hardware in 2024 if you want to get the new features. But as mentioned before, a good bit of it is hardware-dependent. So, if you\u2019ve been holding off on getting new Fire TV hardware, 2024 may be a good year to do so.\n\u201cWe appreciate that customers like to \u2014 like, they bought something a year or two ago and would like to keep it,\u201d Danovitz said. \u201cWe keep adding features as much as we can to all of those devices because it\u2019s good when it gets smarter.\u201d\nAfter years of selling its Chromecast devices -- \"dumb\" media streamers that only work in conjunction with a phone, tablet, or computer -- Google has finally launched a truly smart media streaming device: The $50 Chromecast with Google TV.\nOn paper, this thing has it all. An elegant remote control that balances functionality with simplicity, as well as support for 4K, HDR (even Dolby Vision), and Dolby Atmos. As the name suggests, it still works as a Chromecast for when you want to stream content to your TV directly from another device. The whole show runs on Android TV -- the smart TV software that Google has been refining for years and which now has thousands of streaming apps. And its price is pitch-perfect: $50 is what Roku charges for the Streaming Stick+ and what Amazon charges for its Fire TV Stick 4K.\nAmazon has discounted the Amazon Fire TV Stick (was $40, now $25) Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K (was $50, now $35), Amazon Fire TV Cube (was $120, now $90), and Amazon Fire TV Recast (was $230, now $145) ahead of March Madness.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 spotlight: Alexa Fund startup Weel\nAt CES 2024, we are showcasing how the world's leading brands are building with Amazon's devices and services, and leveraging the latest innovations in artificial intelligence to build the next generation of ambient experiences.\u00a0 This article is part of a series that showcases select brands on display at the Amazon Experience Area at CES 2024.\nMany of us remember our first e-bike ride. That exhilarating sense of speed, the wind in your hair, and the world rushing by are visions that persist over time. Over time, however, the bicycle has largely remained unchanged from its basic design.\u00a0Weel, an\u00a0Alexa Fund\u00a0portfolio company, is on a mission to change that.\nWeel has created a software-driven e-bike (EVB) designed to be safer, more practical, and more convenient. Attendees of the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) will have the opportunity to see the e-bike in action at the Amazon Experience Area, where Weel will demonstrate unique features ranging from adaptive steering to fully autonomous driving. The Alexa Fund, which has provided venture capital funding to fuel not only voice innovation but also areas such as artificial intelligence, hardware, and entertainment, has invested in Weel to further the startup\u2019s vision of making sustainable transportation accessible to all.\n\u201cWe want people to be able to enjoy the benefits of biking,\u201d says David Hansen, co-founder of Weel. \u201cWe want them to feel good about not driving, about using less carbon in their lives. But the way to do that is to give them something that they really enjoy.\u201d\nSoftware for safer cycling\nWeel is redefining the cycling experience by developing an e-bike with software at its center. This advanced approach makes the e-bike appealing not only to hobby riders but also to those seeking a practical and enjoyable ride.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t stop to think about it, but unless you\u2019re extremely skilled on an e-bike, you\u2019re actually unsafe on an e-bike,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is make bikes that are so accessible, so simple, and so joyful to ride that it\u2019s more like riding in a golf cart or a car.\u201d\nWeel\u2019s e-bike is completely software-defined, resonating with cyclists and tech enthusiasts alike. \u201cOur product is essentially a computer that has an e-bike wrapped around it,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cThe e-bike has a single brake lever that is much more like driving a car where you pedal or hit the throttle and it goes, and then you hit the brake and it stops.\u201d\nThe throttle, pedals, and brake lever are not mechanically connected to any one component; instead, the throttle and the brake are controlled by sensors. Riders pedal into a force-feedback generator, which is a pedal-by-wire system where software controls the behavior of motors in both the front and rear wheels.\nThe e-bike includes a range of powerful features designed to make cycling simpler and safer. For example, the e-bike can be remotely controlled through a mobile app. The e-bike employs advanced traction control to prevent slippage and improve stability on slippery or uneven surfaces. It also features an anti-lock braking system, which helps reduce the risk of skidding.\nWeel\u2019s self-balancing technology automatically adjusts the e-bike\u2019s center of gravity to keep it upright, helping prevent potentially dangerous falls. This feature is especially valuable for new or less confident riders. \u201cThis is actually how we got the attention of the Alexa Fund,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cSomeone had shared with them a video of our e-bike self-balancing, and then they came to our Seattle offices to see it in action.\u201d\nUsers can control the e-bike with Weel\u2019s app, adding a layer of convenience and personalization to the riding experience. Through the app, users can configure numerous settings, tailoring the e-bike to their specific needs and preferences. The app provides near-real-time information on speed, directions, and more, making each ride both efficient and enjoyable. Additionally, the app lets riders set specific fitness goals, like calorie burning, and the e-bike automatically adjusts pedal resistance to meet these objectives.\nLicensing technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers\nWeel initially envisioned creating a ride-sharing service for autonomous bicycles, but this vision proved challenging. The startup would have been required to prioritize city contracts over customer-centric innovations, and cities are often slow to adopt new technologies.\nWeel pivoted to focus on personally owned bikes, permitting the company to concentrate on developing user-friendly features and enhancing the individual rider\u2019s experience.\nIn recent years, the startup has begun to collaborate with original equipment manufacturers to extend its technology to other types of vehicles, prioritizing both safety and innovation.\n\u201cOur new focus is on taking this tech that we developed for autonomy and then doing it with riders in mind to try and make safer bikes that are enjoyable,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cWe\u2019re working with several original equipment manufacturers on concept vehicles like scooters and motorcycles, bringing more confidence and safety to riders.\u201d\nWeel\u2019s vision is to transform the biking experience, and with advanced software and technology, it is poised to accomplish just that. The startup envisions a future where the open-air benefits of bikes are merged with greater comfort, inspiring more people to embrace cycling.\n\u201cOne of the most-produced vehicles ever is the bicycle, and to me, it is the most enjoyable for the longest amount of time,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cAt Weel, our thinking is very rider-first. There are good environmental effects from bikes. With high ridership in a city, you can engage in different types of urban planning. We benefit from the large-scale adoption of bikes.\u201d\nCurrently in closed beta in Seattle, Weel\u2019s software-defined e-bike will be showcased at the upcoming CES in Las Vegas. If you want to see the e-bike in action, make sure to visit the Amazon Experience Area at CES 2024.

This mega trade show is one of the best places to see new consumer tech months or sometimes years, before they are available to buy. This year, I am attending the conference in-person, making my way through booths, presentations and hands-on demos to check out what\u2019s new in tech.\nSKIP AHEAD Best tech | Best home and kitchen | Best smart home | Best beauty and wellness | Best health and fitness | Best outdoor\nWith hundreds of products debuting at the show, sometimes the most interesting and practical tech can get lost in the crowd. We made an effort to highlight a mix of products: from the outlandish and spectacular to the more subdued and practical.\nThe best products from CES 2024\nWe focused on products that practically enhance or upgrade our lives. We saw many (but not all) of these products up-close at CES. We tried our best to get our hands on the products when possible.\nGadgets at CES are often previews \u2014 products that aren\u2019t yet available for purchase, but are close enough to the final product consumers will ultimately be able to buy. As such, you won\u2019t be able to get your hands on most of the products on this list just yet.\nBest tech\nSamsung Music Frame\nThis is a minimalist and artistic take on the typical home speaker that takes cues from Samsung\u2019s own The Frame TV. The speaker system is housed inside a box that looks like a picture frame, complete with a customizable print on the front of the box. You can connect to the speaker via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and it can be paired with Samsung TVs and soundbars, according to the brand. Samsung did not reveal a release date or price for the Music Frame.\nLG Signature OLED T TV\nLG has a habit of launching ultra-high end, mildly outlandish TVs at CES. Last year, it debuted the LG Signature OLED R, a TV that rolls down into its stand, so it is out of sight when not in use.\nThe new OLED T is a wireless, 77-inch transparent TV: the front panel is transparent, with an opaque contrast screen behind it. By raising or lowering the contrast screen, you can make the screen look more or less transparent. LG showed off visuals that made it look like a 3D fish tank with the transparent screen, and then raised the opaque panel to show off how the TV functions more normally. The screen is practically invisible when fully transparent or turned off, better blending into the environment instead of looking like a big black screen, says LG. LG did not reveal a release date or price for the TV.\nAsus Rog Zephyrus G14\nThis is the newest version of one of our favorite gaming laptops. This upcoming model has a new, slimmer design that weighs 3.3 pounds, the lightest yet, with a one-piece aluminum frame that looks even more well-suited to travel compared to previous versions. It also has a customizable light strip on the lid. Another big upgrade is the screen: an OLED panel that should provide richer colors and contrast than previous models.\nThese laptops will launch sometime in early 2024.\nRoku Pro Series TV\nRoku started making its own line of TVs in 2023, releasing a range of options under $1000. The new Roku Pro Series TVs will have more advanced picture and audio quality for under $1500. The Pro series will use a 4K QLED mini-LED screen with local dimming and enhanced audio technology, according to the brand.\nThese TVs will also have the new Roku Smart Picture, a software feature that uses AI to identify what type of content is on the screen and automatically adjust the picture settings for an optimal viewing experience, says the brand. As someone who often changes the settings on my TV depending on if I\u2019m watching sports, movies or playing games, the idea of my TV doing this for me sounds exciting.\nThe Roku Pro Series TVs are slated to be released in the spring of 2024 in 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes.\nBest home and kitchen\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nHave you ever wanted to smoke a rack of ribs indoors, in a small apartment kitchen? This countertop smoker uses wood pellets, just like an outdoor smoker, but it turns that wood smoke into warm air, according to the brand.\nThis smoker has six preset food settings (brisket, pork ribs, pork butt, wings, chicken and salmon), and it can connect to the GE Profile Connect app for more features. It does not list a specific capacity, but GE says it can fit 3 racks of ribs (cut in half), a full chicken or a 14 pound pork butt.\nBest smart home\nNanoleaf Skylight Modular Ceiling Light (Pre-order)\nNanoleaf Skylight Modular Ceiling Light\nNanoleaf makes some of our favorite smart lights, including colorful bulbs, wall shapes and portable lamps. This light fixture has a modular design that can be mounted to the ceiling like a skylight. It also uses a traditional hardwire connection for power. Like other Nanoleaf products, it has tons of color tones, fun color scenes like rain or sun shower and can sync with your other smart home gadgets to turn on, off and adjust automatically. It comes with three panels, but can be expanded to include up to 100 panels by incorporating Skylight Expansion Packs.\nEach square emits 1400 lumens of light with a lifespan of 25,000 hours, according to the brand. It connects via Wi-Fi and is compatible with Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung smart home. Pre-orders are available now, with shipping in late January.\nBest beauty and wellness\nProclaim Custom-Jet Oral Health System\nProclaim Custom-Jet Oral Health System\nImagine a water flosser inside of a mouthguard, one that can do all the work of flossing automatically in about seven seconds. That\u2019s the Proclaim system, a 3D-printed mouthpiece up to 60 water jets angled to clear bacteria, plaque and food between your teeth and below your gum line, according to the brand. Excess water flows out of the front section of the mouthpiece into the sink.\nLike other water flossers, it has a base station that provides water to the jet mouthpiece. For larger families, the mouthpiece can be swapped out so that everyone can use the same base station.\nBest health and fitness\nEvie Ring\nEvie Ring\nThis health tracker is designed for women\u2019s health, with menstrual, sleep, heart rate, and activity tracking, according to the brand. It has an open design to better accommodate the natural changes in size our bodies go through every day, says the brand. Unlike many fitness trackers, it comes with a charging case so you can more easily charge the ring on the go. It has up to four days of battery life, and the charging case adds up to 10 full charges. Currently, it is only compatible with iPhones.\nWithings BeamO\nThe Withings BeamO is a thermometer, stethoscope, pulse oximeter and electrocardiogram in one device. It\u2019s designed to help you measure core health vitals easily at home, data that may help health professionals better perform remote health visits, according to the brand. The device syncs with the Withings Health Mate app when connected to Wi-Fi, and is USB-C rechargeable.\nThe BeamO will retail for $249.95 when it launches in June of 2024, following FDA clearance of its ECG capability, says the brand.\nGarmin Lily 2 Smartwatch\nGarmin Lily 2 Smartwatch\nSmartwatches have a tendency to be big and bulky. Not so with Garmin\u2019s Lily 2. Like the Lily 1, it is a small, 35mm circular touchscreen smartwatch that aims to mix form and function. It tracks health, workout and sleep data, similar to most of our favorite fitness trackers.\nImprovements over the original include a metal housing, sleep tracking, contactless Garmin Pay, new workout options, and much more through the Garmin Connect app. It has up to five days of battery life, and works with iPhone and Android smartphones.\nBest outdoor\nJackery Solar Mars Bot\nWhat if your solar panels could follow the sun? This robot does just that, automatically tracking bright light and navigating outdoor environments to follow it. The solar array folds up while moving, and expands while stationary. It has multiple cameras onboard that help it avoid obstacles. It can also charge at user-designed spots, and can be moved by hand if needed. Onboard are multiple USB-A, USB-C, three-prong and 120V power output ports. The brand did not reveal a release date or price for the Solar Mars Bot.\nRelated\nselect9 gadgets from CES 2024 that you can actually buy right now\nWhy trust NBC Select?\nHarry Rabinowitz is a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness, including guides to wireless earbuds, fitness trackers and new and notable products.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"
