The standard 18650 battery ensures enough power for up to 7 hours of operation time and quick and simple battery replacement makes it possible for continuous observation without disruptions. The three scene modes and six color palettes enable users to observe their field of vision more effectively and adapt the device to shifting observational situations.\nExcept the ADIHX, the FIFA World Cup 2022 is set to get underway in Qatar in November.

This new arrival comes with the enhanced and new capabilities of night vision, laser indicating and outdoor lighting that enable users to absorbedly explore the world through the darkness.\nNew Arrival TK Gen 2 Thermal Imaging Monocular\nEquipped with Guide's new self-developed infrared detector and the patented image processing technology, the new TK captures sharp imaging and is packed with powerful features like image and video recording, smooth zoom, approximate ranging and PIP. Personalized image observation is supported in different scene modes.\nHuntEx2022 in Johannesburg, South Africa\nThis Guide thermal monocular chose its first show at the HuntEx2022 from April 22 to 24 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Unexpectedly, the power failure left visitors in the dark across the hall last day and it did not enrage visitors who came to the Guide Sensmart's booth. The visitors took this thermal camera for night vision. The considerate ergonomic design makes it a comfort for one-hand operation and portability, and differential button design allows operation in total darkness. Visitors like the amazing imaging quality and they can't keep their hands off it. Detection up to 3km ensures the long-range view and safety, which can be used for animal observation.\nSince thermal imaging camera is a passive non-contact recognition tool of targets, it is concealed and not easy to be discovered, making it convenient to observe fast animals in a safer place. Three scene modes give prominence to animals and its LCOS eyepiece prevents condensation or fogging and helps users maintain a clear view.\nMILIPOL QATAR exhibition in Doha Exhibition & Convention Center\nExcept the TK Gen2, Guide Sensmart will showcase their newest products and solutions at MILIPOL QATAR exhibition taking place May 24-26, 2022, in Doha Exhibition & Convention Center.\nAt booth #C070, Guide Sensmart will show innovative thermal imagers for petroleum & metallurgy, mechanical & electrical and law enforcement.

This is where the world's biggest brands do business and meet new partners, and the sharpest innovators hit the stage. CES 2023 was back in Las Vegas on Jan. 5-8. Guide Sensmart, the leading thermal camera manufacturer appeared in Central Hall as an excellent producer of high-performance thermal imagers.\nAt CES 2023, Guide Sensmart showcased its representative products \u2014 PT Series HD High-Performance Thermal Camera, TK Gen2 and TD Series Handheld Thermal Imaging Monocular, TN Series Handheld Thermal Binoculars, TU Series Thermal Imaging Riflescope and MobIR 2S/2T Thermal Camera for Smartphone, etc.\nGuide Sensmart at CES\nThese products attracted a lot of attendee, most of whom showed great interest in PT Series. PT-Series, the world's first portable thermal camera with MP-level IR resolution, possesses new functions that other thermal cameras do not have. The dual 8 MP and 16 MP visible light lenses allow for both wide-area and telephoto views. NFC one-touch transfer allows data interchange between this camera and another mobile device in 5 seconds. As long as an update is available, users can upgrade the PT Series through the OTA. The 5G module provides users with the ultra-reliable, low-latency network they need. This is the first time the infrared thermal imaging camera has been used with a 5G network. Applications for PT Series are numerous. In electric power, PT Series assists the operation and maintenance engineers to conduct thermal analysis of equipment status and potential defects. In intelligent manufacturing, the irregular heat distribution can be detected to improve production efficiency. In building inspection, it assists in energy assessment, fault diagnosis, leakage source location, etc., to provide a basis for accurate maintenance.\nWould you want to put all of Guide Sensmart's great thermal cameras to the test? Then stop by SHOT Show 2023 (booth No. 40548) in Las Vegas, the world's largest trade show for hunting, shooting sports, outdoor activities, and security, where our new device, DU50 Day & Night Vision Scope will be launched.
