If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission.\nThe Best New Gear, Gadgets and Other Products We Saw at CES 2024\nA lot of cool new tech-related products have been announced at CES 2024. These are our favorites.\nEarlier this year, Apple attempted to steal CES's thunder by announcing the availability of the Vision Pro headset: it'll be up for pre-order on January 19 and available everywhere on February 2. And while it definitely worked, it didn't exactly stop the world's largest electronics show. A bunch of innovative new TVs, laptops, futuristic cars, hi-fi equipment, smart home appliances, wellness devices and all sorts of other gadgets still caught our attention at the show.\nLooking back on the week that was, we're highlighting the coolest new gear and gadgets that were revealed at CES 2024. Check out our favorite products from the show below.\nRabbit R1\nRabbit R1\nThe Rabbit R1 has undoubtedly been one of the stars of this year's CES. It's an adorable AI-powered device (designed in collaboration with Teenage Engineering) that's meant to help you do simple tasks while keeping your smartphone in your pocket. The tiny device also has its own virtual assistant that can help you answer questions, call friends, play music and even do app-based tasks like ordering food or a rideshare.\nPrice: $199Availability: March 2024\nLG Signature OLED T\nLG Signature OLED T\nBy far the most interesting TV announced at CES 2024 was the LG Signature OLED T \u2014 it's the company's first transparent OLED TV (yes, the \"T\" stands for transparent). It's a 77-inch TV with a contrast panel that can raised or lowered with the press of a button. When raised, the OLED T looks like a normal TV. When lowered, it creates this 3D floating effect. The idea is when you're not actually watching TV, you can lower the panel and have custom visuals playing that make it seem like you're looking at a fireplace or a fish tank. The LG Signature OLED T is going to wildly expensive and, if we're being honest, impractical for the vast majority of people ... but we've never seen a TV like it.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: Sometime in 2024\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda has had a sluggish start to the modern electric vehicle era, at least in North America. But at CES 2024, Honda offered us the best preview of what its future will look like in the form of the \"0 Series\" concept cars. The more notable of the two was the 0 Series Saloon, which looks like the Bizzarrini Manta. Believe it or not, Honda says it's coming to North America in 2026, and the company's CEO says the final product will keep \"90 percent\" of the concept's appearance.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2026\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe standout turntable from this year's show was Victrola's Stream Sapphire. It's essentially a way more premium version of the company's Stream Carbon ($699) \u2014 and yes, it also \"Works with Sonos\" so you can wirelessly stream music to your Sonos sound system, no additional components needed.\nThe new model is made of more premium materials, higher-quality components (including a brushless motor and a Ortofon Blue 2M cartridge) and has more advanced streaming capabilities. The Stream Sapphire supports Roon and UPnP and is capable of streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz).\nPrice: $1,499Availability: This spring\nWithings BeamO\nWithings BeamO\nThe BeamO is probably the coolest health and wellness gadget we've seen at this year's show. It's an innovative device that's loaded with sensors for monitoring the health of your heart and lungs, as well as general health with body temperature. Basically, it promises to serve as a thermometer, digital stethoscope, oximeter and EKG that you can use in your home or bring with you on your travels. It's expected to be available this summer (likely June) assuming that it's cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.\nPrice: $250Availability: Likely June\nSony / Honda Afeela\nSony / Honda Afeela\nLast year, Sony unveiled the Afeela concept, an EV designed with Honda that seemed like a flight of fancy \u2013 but the tech brand insisted this follow-up to its 2020 concept car was production-bound. We had our doubts ... until this year, when Sony and Honda brought a revised version of the Afeela to CES that seems much more production-ready. The revised front end has proper headlamps and physical side-view mirrors \u2014 a sure sign of production intent in a concept car these days. The Afeela will use two 241-hp motors for all-wheel-drive, but potential buyers will more likely be excited by the ability to stream movies and play video games in a home theater-like interior.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2026\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro C20\nThe Audio Pro C20 was the standout wireless speaker at CES 2024 because it can just about do it all. It supports Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth streaming. It has an HDMI ARC input so you can use it as a miniature soundbar for your TV, and it has a built-in MM phono stage for connecting a turntable. Throw in the fact that it has a minimalist design (available in three finishes) and it'll probably blend into most folks' existing home decor.\nPrice: $550Availability: February 2024\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a standout 2-in-1 because it's capable of running two operating systems, Android or Windows, and promises to switch seamlessly between the two depending on what mode it's in. When its detachable keyboard is connected and it's in laptop mode, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid runs Windows. When the keyboard is detached, it switches to Android. Pretty cool.\nPrice: $2,000Availability: Q2 2024\nMercedes-Benz G-Class Prototype / EQG\nMercedes-Benz G-Class Prototype / EQG\nMercedes made all sorts of announcements at CES 2024, but many of them were of a rather minor sort \u2014 an improved in-car voice assistant that uses A.I. to behave more naturally, software developed with will.i.am that turns your electric car into a rolling instrument, etc. The quiet show-stopper, though, was an apparent production-ready (or at least near-production-ready) version of the electric G-Class that's been in the works for several years. Based on the gas-guzzling regular G-wagen, it'll pack quad-motor all-wheel-drive and should offer utterly insane off-road capability, without ever using a drop of fuel. It's expected to go on sale before the end of 2024.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2024\nFiiO R9\nFiiO R9\nThe FiiO R9 is an upgraded version of last year's GP100-worthy R7. Like its predecessor, the R9 is an all-in-one desktop hi-fi solution. It's a high-end streaming DAC and headphone amplifier with its own Android operating system and a multitude of wireless and wired connections. The difference with R9 is that it has an improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, improved twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO) and a twice-as-powerful amplifier. It also adds an HDMI ARC port in case you want to connect it to a TV.\nPrice: $1,499Availability: Now\nSupernal S-A2\nSupernal S-A2\nWe've been promised flying cars for about as long as the car has existed, but in spite of many false starts, it's never come to pass. Nevertheless, the next few years may see that dream finally come to fruition ... at least in a manner of speaking, as electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (e-VTOL) crafts finally offer something close to the mix of automotive ease of use and airplane-like flight. Supernal is Hyundai's air mobility division, and the S-A2 is its latest product. The brand says it's only as loud as a dishwasher when taking off, can travel 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet and packs a commute-worthy range of 25 to 40 miles. Thanks to the input of Hyundai design boss Luc Donckerwolke, the S-A2 looks like something George Jetson might take to work ... which makes it close enough to a flying car for us.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: 2028"

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nUAG mobile accessories: Rugged Apple Watch straps and Z Fold 4 case\nRugged Apple Watch Ultra watch bands and a case for the Galaxy Z Fold 4\nUAG has long been one of my favorite brands for mobile accessories and it continues to release functional gear that protects your expensive mobile tech. We spent a couple of weeks with a few Apple Watch Ultra straps and a protective case for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra is an amazing smartwatch with a $799 price while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 starts at $1,799. Both of these investments deserve to be worn with quality watch bands and protected by rugged cases. Urban Armor Gear has several products available to help you achieve these goals with reasonable prices and cool color options too.\nAlso: I put the Apple Watch Ultra through a Tough Mudder: Here's how it held up\nActive Watch Strap\nWhen I purchased my Apple Watch Ultra, there were limited options for bands in order to get a watch on my wrist as quickly as possible. Since the launch, I have been looking for watch straps that match the rugged style and colors of the Apple Watch Ultra. The UAG Active Strap is available in Rust, Graphite, and Foliage Green. With the safety orange highlights on the Watch Ultra, I selected the Rust color and have not been disappointed.\nThe Active Strap is available now for $69.95. While it is advertised for the Apple Watch Ultra, it also fits the larger sized Apple Watch models. It is clearly not going anywhere once you secure it to your wrist.\nThe band is made with elastic webbing material so it stretches a bit to make it comfortable throughout the day and easy to mount on your wrist. This material also allows the strap to dry out if it gets wet and the stainless steel hardware means it will not rust, even though that is the name of the color I tested.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra safety orange works well with this strap\nMultiple rows of Velcro secure the strap to your wrist. The tension lock slider hardware is a bit bulky, but it is also angled so it fits well around your wrist. The band is well constructed with tight stitching and superb fit and finish.\nNATO ECO strap\nThe NATO ECO strap is available for $49.95 in Foliage Green, Graphite, and Dark Earth. We tested the Foliage Green color.\nThe NATO ECO strap is made from RPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) so buying this band helps keep plastic water bottles out of landfills and the oceans. The nylon weave material is durable and very well sewn together.\nUAG branding is prominent on the strap\nThe band hardware is made of recycled stainless steel with two additional pass-throughs on the band to keep the bitter end secured against the strap when you wear it. I was surprised to find this band ended up being my favorite and it worked very well while exercising and while working.\nThe watch band is designed for wrists from 125-208mm in circumference with 11 openings to secure the latch to fit your wrist. The band is comfortable and light weight so it doesn't add much to the overall Apple Watch Ultra package. The strap fits into the Apple Watch lug system quickly and easily too.\nIt's great to see UAG using recycled plastics and stainless steel in its products\nCivilian strap\nNot every strap hits it out of the park and I have to say that the Civilian strap was my least favorite of the three that I tested. The band is very light holds the Apple Watch Ultra in place well, but the soft silicone material collects animal hair, lint, and dust to a very high degree and it's tough to wipe it all off easily.\nI am personally also not a fan of the tuck closure system, common on default Apple Watch straps, and with the soft silicone material it took a bit of effort to tuck in the bitten end of the strap. The Civilian strap is available in Mallard (blue) and Black for $49.95.\nThe stainless steel hardware is great and the openings along the entire length of the strap keep air passing through the strap and making the strap adjustable for any size wrist. The silicone material is antimicrobial so it also helps keep things clean and fresh.\nAlso: Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4 is a high-priced ticket to productivity heaven\nGalaxy Z Fold 4 Civilian case\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4 remains my favorite phone of 2022 and I appreciate cases that protect this expensive investment. The UAG Civilian Series case offers solid protection for the back, front, and even the hinge on the Z Fold 4 with a light weight design and perfect fit. It has material that makes it easy to hold onto with adhesive stripe stickers to hold the case on the phone.\nThe back is well protected\nWhile the front is well protected, the edge around the front display is raised a bit too high for me to reliably swipe in from the edges with my finger. I don't use the Cover Display that much so this isn't too much of an issue, but you should know the front is raised quite a bit above the display.\nThe raised edges help protect the front, but make it a bit tough to swipe from the edge\nThe back fits well and has openings for the camera, mics, speakers, and USB-C port with a cool back UAG logo. The volume button design is a bit unusual and not my favorite either. The spine/hinge of the Z Fold 4 is protected a bit with light material that covers the hinge when in the closed position and slides behind the back panel in the open position.\nThere is a bit of protection for the hinge when closed\nThe case is certified as a Designed for Samsung product with MIL-STD 810G-516.6 drop test approval. Wireless charging and Samsung Pay work just fine with the Z Fold 4 in the case too. There is no storage option for the S Pen."

Bored with the corporate world and unimpressed by the case offerings at the time, three founders got together and decided to create a case that could provide unrivaled protection for their phones in the most challenging situations.\nThe first iPhone case UAG developed was for the iPhone 4, and featured UAG\u2019s signature pattern, inspired by jerry cans. Jerry cans were first popularized during World War II, made of pressed steel to create rigidity and strength while remaining lightweight to transport liquids like gas and water to troops. UAG includes its own now-iconic version of the jerry can design to invoke this sense of high-quality, military-grade strength that has come to represent UAG.\u00a0 Initially, sales were slow and it wasn\u2019t until the Samsung S3 was launched that the market started to take notice.\nThrough brute force, UAG was able to make a name for itself by marketing in forums, blogs (remember those?) and giving away free samples to tech enthusiasts. Soon word began to spread and stories began pouring in of customers whose phones were protected by UAG after they were dropped off buildings, down walls, run over by cars, and worse.\nThe fun didn\u2019t stop there. As phone manufacturers put out larger and larger devices, the need for protection increased even further. UAG went to great lengths to prove our cases could stand up to the rigors of active lifestyles and embarked on a series of tests to demonstrate it our breakthrough design and functionality.\nThe first major case brand to have all our products third-party certified to Military Standards (MIL-STD 810G 516.6)\nThe first company to send an iPhone 6 into space (and have it survive)\nThe first Microsoft Surface Case to pass MIL-STD 810G 516.6\nThe first company to throw our phones out of a moving vehicle (120 MPH) and have it survive\nThe first rugged Apple Watchband was specifically designed for surfing.\nThe introduction of the Monarch Series, which fuses 5-layers of protection with advanced materials such as carbon fiber and Kevlar\u00ae\nCreated the most rugged & thin MacBook Pro cases to pass US Military Drop Test Standards\nAs the response from customers increased, we started getting more and more placement as outdoor enthusiasts and people from all walks of life came to appreciate the durability, quality, and style of our cases.\nToday you can find UAG online at UrbanArmorGear.com, as well as the world\u2019s largest retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Verizon, AT&T, Target, and thousands of additional independent wireless retailers."
