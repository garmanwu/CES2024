ALL ON.\", emphasizing the promotion of sustainable development of mankind through science and technology. There is no doubt that there are all kinds of cutting-edge \"black technologies\" at CES every year. In the past few years, the concepts, technologies and products exhibited at CES each year will influence or even dominate the wind direction of the technology industry in the next period of time.\nCES 2024 has thousands of enterprises participating in the exhibition, with great momentum, rich scenes and hard core of science and technology. A significant change is that Chinese enterprises are gradually changing from \"followers\" to \"leaders\". Many Chinese enterprises are doing their best. Among them, Guangfeng Technology (688007.SH), the first listed company on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, has reappeared at CES with its on-board optics and home laser display core devices to show the world the innovative power of Chinese science and technology.\nDuring CES, Li Yi, founder, chairman and CEO of Guangfeng Technology, said in an interview with Agence France-Presse, \"For science and technology companies, the global market is still full of opportunities and challenges, especially core devices with key technologies. Manufacturers still have new opportunities.\" Prior to this, international media including CNBC (US Consumer News and Business Channel) and The Economist (International News and Business Week published in the UK) have also interviewed and reported Guangfeng Technology many times.\nThe world's first vehicle-level projection giant screen\nAccording to statistics and analysis by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, from January to November 2023, my country's production and sales of new energy vehicles reached 8.426 million and 8.304 million respectively, a year-on-year increase of 34.5 and 36.7 respectively, and a market share of 30.8.
