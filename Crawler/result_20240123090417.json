        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Unveiling the Future of Home Robotics\nThe field of robotics has always fascinated us, and CES 2024 demonstrated that the intrigue surrounding these machines is far from over. From futuristic demos to functional prototypes, the event showcased the cutting-edge capabilities of home robots. While some may argue that these demos are merely a spectacle, they serve as a clear indication that big electronics firms are still committed to innovation and technological advancement. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the slow progress of home robots, the potential breakthroughs on the horizon, and the current state of the industry.\nThe Evolution of Home Robotics\nThe Roomba Revolution\nWhen it comes to home robots, the first name that comes to mind is Roomba. The Roomba, introduced by iRobot in 2002, revolutionized the industry with its autonomous vacuuming capabilities. Despite numerous attempts by companies to create a better robot vacuum, the Roomba remains unmatched in functionality and popularity. Over the years, Roombas have become smarter, more efficient, and even capable of mopping. They have become a staple in many households, alleviating the burden of mundane chores.\nThe Quest for Security\nAnother area where home robots have shown promise is in the realm of security. The idea of having a mobile surveillance system that can navigate our homes has captured the imagination of many. Companies like Amazon have tried to tap into this market with products like Astro, a home robot with integrated security features. However, the high price point and limited functionality have hindered its widespread adoption. While security remains a potential application for home robots, there are still several challenges to overcome before they become a common sight in our households.\nMatic: A Step Forward\nAt CES 2024, Matic, a company specializing in home robotics, showcased a unique approach to the category. They have developed a home robotics platform that excels in vacuuming and mopping. Their system utilizes an array of cameras to map spaces and navigate efficiently. Matic\u2019s founders, backed by knowledgeable sources, have created a foundation for home robots that can potentially evolve into more advanced and versatile machines. By mastering the level 5 autonomy required for independent navigation, Matic opens doors to additional functionality and applications.\nThe Future of Home Robotics\nOvercoming Limitations\nOne of the key challenges in developing home robots is functionality. Most robots in the market are designed to perform a single specific task repeatedly. While the Roomba has dominated the robot vacuum space, the industry has struggled to expand beyond this narrow focus. The silver bullet for home robots lies in tackling chores that people dislike or find challenging. Tasks like mobile grasping, reaching high places, and traversing stairs are complex but necessary for a truly versatile home robot. Companies are exploring solutions by incorporating arms, legs, and even humanoid features into their designs.\nThe Rise of Humanoids\nHumanoids have long fascinated roboticists and researchers. The idea of having a robot that resembles a human and can navigate our homes intuitively is appealing. However, commercial general-purpose humanoid home robots are not expected to be available in the near future. The primary reasons for this are the high cost of development and the complexity of navigating unstructured home environments. While warehouses and factories offer a more structured environment for robots, our homes present a myriad of challenges that must be overcome before humanoid robots become a reality.\nThe Role of Generative AI\nGenerative AI, a technology that was prevalent at CES 2024, holds immense potential for the future of robotics. Learning and natural language processing are two areas where generative AI can significantly impact the capabilities of robots. By enabling robots to learn and adapt, and by facilitating seamless communication between humans and machines, generative AI can pave the way for general-purpose home robots. However, optimistic projections suggest that it may take at least five years before we see the full potential of generative AI in robotics.\nThe Age Tech Space: A Promising Market\nWhile we wait for the advent of general-purpose home robots, there is a growing market for age tech devices aimed at older individuals. Japan, with its aging population, has been at the forefront of this trend. Robots designed to assist older people in living independently have gained traction in this market. Devices like Labrador\u2019s assistive cart system and the desktop ElliQ robot assistant are examples of age tech products that can bring the benefits of robotics into our homes today. Targeting the baby boomer demographic, which controls a significant portion of disposable income, presents a lucrative opportunity for companies in the age tech space.\nConclusion\nCES 2024 shed light on the exciting future of home robotics. While the road to ubiquitous home robots may still be long, advancements in technology, such as Matic\u2019s innovative approach and the potential of generative AI, offer hope for a more versatile and capable generation of robots. As we continue to explore the possibilities, we must not forget the current market for age tech devices, which can bring the benefits of robotics into our homes in a practical and meaningful way.

        "raw_content": "To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\nTo revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\nAdrienne So\nA First Look at Matic, the Reengineered Robot Vacuum\nWithin a few minutes of arriving at the WIRED offices in San Francisco, Matic cofounder Mehul Nariyawala brings up the classic Paul Graham piece on schlep blindness. The essay talks about how engineers will often shrink away from starting a company to tackle a very commonly understood problem simply because solving that problem would require too much work. They don't want to schlep, so they put aside the world-changing idea and instead just go build something easy.\nWe\u2019re watching the prototype, Matic, slowly work out whether the color differentiations of the concrete floor in the WIRED offices actually signal whether it\u2019s moving from hardwood to carpet. I ask Nariyawala why so many startups compete to create a self-driving car when the problem of creating a simple, effective, yet affordable robot vacuum is right there waiting to be solved.\n\u201cWe had a chance to work on Waymo,\u201d Nariyawala says, referring to himself and his partner Navneet Dalal, both former Google engineers. (Nariyawala has a degree in bioinformatics and headed Google\u2019s Nest Cam division; Dalal was a senior research scientist at Google Nest.) \u201cBut if you make a mistake in a self-driving car, you die \u2026 You don't develop true level 5 intelligence from avoiding mistakes. Intelligence comes from learning from your mistakes, instead of being mistake-free.\u201d\nThe home\u2014especially a chaotic one, with kids and pets\u2014is an incredibly dynamic environment, and the home cleaning space is ripe for disruption. So why hasn\u2019t the robot vacuum changed in design since the 1990s? Matic aims to have a solution to this problem on the market by early 2024. The robovac that we're watching tool around on the floor is a late-stage prototype. So far, it looks pretty good.\nI love robot vacuums. I've tested them for years. But as my colleague Simon Hill notes, even after years of development, they still come with an array of problems that no one has solved. The bins are tiny and the self-emptying stations are enormous. Navigation systems that use cameras can be a potential invasion of privacy. You still have to pick up the floor to remove things that could be potential robot vacuum booby traps. This is the imperfect wilderness Matic hopes to tame.\nRather than try to make incremental improvements on the classic robot vacuum disc, Nariyawala and Dalal thought up a new design for a more human-oriented robot vacuum-mop. That entailed changing the entire shape of the vacuum to a white, curved robot, like the egg-shaped probe from Wall-E or the Jibo (RIP). \u201cKids are afraid of [the Roomba],\u201d Nariyawala says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want kids or dogs to be scared of it.\u201d\nIts edges are squared off to let it clean corners effectively, and it has robust wheels to travel throughout the house on all different floor surfaces. Rather than coming to rest in an enormous self-cleaning docking station, it\u2019s taller to accommodate a much larger battery, a clean water reservoir for the mop, and\u2014this actually blew my mind\u2014a disposal bag with both charcoal and diaper salts to pick up both wet and dry messes at the same time. I hadn't seen this in a robot vacuum. Cleaning a dirty water tank clogged with solid debris is so unpleasant that I always do a preliminary vacuum run before mopping. It never occurred to me that you could do both at once.\nThe next achievement of the Matic hardware lies in the realization that suction power does not always mean your floor will be cleaner. For years, most robot vacuums have been introducing more and more suction power, but all that means is you\u2019re usually just balding your carpets, Nariyawala says with a shrug. Instead, the Matic focuses on more effective agitation of the cleaning surface, with a roller brush whose flippers are much longer than normal. Matic\u2019s mop also lifts over an inch off the surface of the ground, so it doesn't inadvertently drag a damp cloth over your rugs and carpet.\nFinally, the vacuum is much, much quieter than almost every vacuum I\u2019ve tested\u2014a mere 55 decibels, or the level of a quiet conversation, versus a much more disruptive 75 decibels, which is, sad to say, about the volume of a lawn mower. All this is in a robot whose battery lasts through about two and a half hours of vacuuming and three hours of mopping.\nScott Gilbertson\nLauren Goode\nAarian Marshall\nJulian Chokkattu\nFrom my observation, Nariyawala ran Matic continuously for two hours in the WIRED offices without the robot needing to recharge.\n\u201cA level 5 car should drive like a human, and a level 5 robot vacuum should clean like a human,\u201d Nariyawala says. To that end, Matic has five RBG cameras on all sides of its body. Rather than using lidar, gyroscopes, or infrared sensors to navigate your home, Matic sees like a human being and builds maps of the area on the fly. I watched on Nariyawala\u2019s iPad as Matic built a map of obstacles in the WIRED offices, which included my feet moving from side to side as I shuffled around the room.\nFuture iterations will include gesture-based navigation. Ideally, Matic will be able to clean continuously and you will be able to visually indicate that you want it to clean under the kitchen table and then go to the trash can to be emptied. This feature wasn\u2019t yet working when we tested it.\nMatic is Wi-Fi-enabled, but data will be stored locally. Map information is streamed directly from the app to the robot over your local Wi-Fi network. All the mapping data and analysis will be confined to your devices, which should help keep the information about your house more secure.\nThe version of Matic that will ship in March 2024 will include the Nvidia Jetson Orin chip, which is designed to support automation and AI robotics, and will hopefully allow the vacuum to incorporate machine intelligence as it learns to clean your home without your help. \u201cA robot and a human should be able to read and use the same map,\u201d Nariyawala says. When human beings have a mental map, they can engage in natural conversation with it\u2014if you give a human directions to the public library, it should be able to find its way. Matic will do the same thing.\nThe prototype Matic did not have the new chip, but it cleaned remarkably well. I laid out several tests for it, far beyond the magnitude of what it might face in my own home\u2014a truly horrifying jumble of baby food, Froot Loops, and Orbeez that made Nariyawala visibly nervous. I also walked around in front of it and waved my hands in front of its \u201cface\u201d to simulate little kids interfering with its operations, but it blithely evaded and ignored me.\nAside from the hiccup when Matic couldn\u2019t tell that different colors of concrete were neither carpet nor hardwood, it filled the trash bag to capacity with a surprising amount of debris. The wet baby food was immediately absorbed, ready to be disposed of.\nIn my years of testing robot vacuums, I\u2019ve accepted that various common problems will just be part of the experience. Of course there will be regular maintenance issues. (Matic offers a monthly $15 monthly maintenance membership which will offer refills on HEPA bags, mop rolls, and brush rolls.) Of course you\u2019ll have to empty dirty bins and poke through self-emptying chutes with your fingers (yuck). Of course you\u2019ll have to operate it through an app that only you will have on your phone, and then of course your spouse will regularly call you as you\u2019re trying to live your life because they lost the vacuum again. Matic aims to solve all these through an almost complete redesign.\nThe Matic comes with a $1,800 price tag, and while that may seem exorbitant, it\u2019s not much more than many of the high-end multifunctional cleaning robots currently on the market. From my early peek at what that money gets you, I\u2019m excited to let this guy roam around my home.\nYou Might Also Like \u2026\n\ud83d\udce8 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter\nHow not to be stupid about AI, with Yann LeCun\nBlood, guns, and broken scooters: The chaotic rise and fall of Bird\nThe year the millennial internet died\nWomen in the US are stockpiling abortion pills\nWhat it\u2019s like to use Apple\u2019s Lockdown Mode\n\ud83d\udd0c Charge right into travel season with the best travel adapters, power banks, and USB hubs\nSimon Hill\nJaina Grey\nEric Ravenscraft\nJulian Chokkattu\nAdrienne So\nSimon Hill\nAdrienne So\nJaina Grey\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax service code: Extra 20% Off TurboTax online federal products\nH&R Block coupon: $50 off your next purchase\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nGoPro Promo Code: 15% Off Cameras and Accessories\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The Robot Report\nTop 10 robots seen at CES 2024\nBy Mike Oitzman | January 13, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 CES 2024 featured a wide range of emerging technologies, from fitness devices and videogames to autonomous vehicles. But robots always have a significant presence in the sprawling exhibit halls.\nThe Robot Report visited numerous booths in the Eureka Park section of CES, as well as in the other focused sections of the event. Here are some highlights from this week\u2019s event:\nMobinn climbs stairway toward success\nMobinn is a Korean startup focused on last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles. While the concept of last-mile delivery isn\u2019t new, Mobinn demonstrated an innovative wheeled robot that can climb stairs.\nThe robot is capable of going up and down stairs through the implementation of compliant wheels. A self-leveling box on top of the robot keeps the cargo level, so your drinks and food don\u2019t spill out of their containers.\nGlidance guides people with vision impairments\nThe latest prototype of the Glidance device is fully functional for public demos and includes a camera in the handle and radar sensors in the base. | Credit: The Robot Report\nRoboBusiness PitchFire 2023 winner Glidance also won a CES 2024 Innovation Award and showed the latest functional prototype of its Glide device in its booth. The robotic Glide guides sight-impaired individuals similar to a guide dog.\nThe startup is designing Glide to be affordable and easy to learn how to use when it starts shipping later this year. I tried Glide firsthand (while closing my eyes). The experience was incredible, and I can only imagine how promising this technology would be for an individual with sight loss.\nThe team at Glidance mentioned to me that celebrity Stevie Wonder came to the Glidance booth for a demo of the product during CES.\nUnitree H1 humanoid steals the show\nThere were two full-size humanoid robots at CES 2024.\nKepler Robotics had a stationary model of the new Kepler Forerunner K1 in its Eureka Park booth. The robot includes 14 linear-axis motors and 14 rotary-axis motors. Unfortunately, the company was unable to give live demos of the Forerunner.\nThe Unitree H1 humanoid robot uses sensors in its \u201chead\u201d to perceive the world around the robot as it navigates and avoids obstacles. | Credit: The Robot Report\nThe internet influencer darling of CES has to be the Unitree H1 humanoid, and the company was giving nearly continuous live demos of the H1 at its booth.\nKudos to the Unitree marketing team for its now-infamous \u201ckick the robot\u201d videos that have been shared on social media over the past six months. In the videos, H1 appears to be a solid humanoid platform with respectable balance and agility.\nHowever, as a longtime robotics industry insider and experienced robotics applications engineer, I thought the Unitree H1 product demos at CES 2024 were cringe-worthy, as the Unitree demo team walked the H1 robot into crowds of \u201cinternet tech influencers\u201d with their cameras ablaze.\nThe 150 lb. (68 kg) robot danced with the public inches away. A single tripping incident would have sent the robot tumbling into an innocent bystander and made instant headlines. It would have been a public relations disaster and a setback for the industry.\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that the H1 was a crowd favorite at CES 2024, and the company and its robot received a lot of news media attention.\nHyundai displays future mobility tech at CES 2024\nHyundai PnD Module concept\nThe company had multiple large-scale booths showing autonomy concepts for the future, including autonomous mobility for both humans and freight, as well as a look at the future of autonomous construction vehicles. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to witness either of the live mobility demonstrations, but the Hyundai Construction Xite concept tractor was an impressive incarnation of autonomous construction designs.\nHyundai presented a concept for the future of autonomous construction equipment with the display of the Construction Xite tractor (Editors note: for scale, the bucket arm is over 10 ft tall). | Credit: The Robot Report\nAV24 rolls into the showroom\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) had an impressive booth in the automotive hall of CES 2024, surrounded by well-known brand names. On display was a fully functional version of the newest AV24 autonomous racecar, showing off the integration of an entirely new autonomy stack in the vehicle.\nThe IAC has partnered with many of the leading automotive technology companies to embed the latest lidar, radar, vision, and GPS sensors within the vehicle.\ndSpace announced an extended partnership with IAC that will deliver digital twins of each university team\u2019s vehicle along with digital twins of each of the race tracks. In turn, these will enable the teams to train the AI drivers completely in simulation and then port the AI models and drive code directly the physical race cars.\nIn addition, some sanctioned sim races are possible later this year, said the IAC organizers.\nEmbodied AI displays updated Moxie\nThe latest generation of Moxie by Embodied AI was on display in Amazon\u2019s booth at CES. Embodied recently announced new tutoring functionality with the latest software release for Moxie, and it demonstrated the software at the expo.\nAmazon had a separate expo suite that featured all of the physical Amazon consumer and smart home products (Amazon Astro was noticeably absent from the display). Moxie entertained the gathered crowds as it demonstrated its interactivity.\nFingervision measures gripper force\nMy \u201cUnknown Discovery\u201d award of CES 2024 goes to a young Japanese startup called Fingervision. This was a serendipitous discovery of an innovation that uses tiny cameras built into the gripper fingers of an industrial robot,\nThey provide feedback on the grip force and \u201cslippage\u201d of an item held with the gripper. This is accomplished by imaging the area where the fingers touch an object through an opaque surface. Thus the origin of the company name.\nThe company has deployed its first grippers into an application where robots are picking up fried chicken nuggets and packaging them.\nHonorable mentions from CES 2024\nGatik keeps on trucking \u2014 autonomously\nGatik showed the third generation of its on-road autonomous truck. The company has made its mark on autonomous logistics through the deployment of driving algorithms that plans paths so that the vehicle only makes right-hand turns, avoiding more complex and dangerous left-hand turns.\nGatik first demonstrated fully driverless, freight-only commercial deliveries on the middle mile with Walmart in 2021. Shortly after, it\u00a0executed the first fully driverless deployment for Canada\u2019s largest retailer, Loblaw.\nThe company also announced a partnership with Goodyear tires to develop \u201cSmart Tires\u201d that can provide real-time feedback to the autonomous driver with data about the condition of the tires to help maintain traction and control.\nBobcat Rogue X2 gets ready to move the earth\nAt CES 2024, Bobcat showed off an autonomous concept prototype, the Bobcat Rogue X2, at CES 2024. The all-electric, autonomous robot is designed for handling material movement and ground-altering operations at construction, mining, and agriculture sites.\nThe design prototype of the Rogue X2 at CES had wheels rather than tracks, but manually driven Bobcats can be equipped with tracks, so a production version of the Rogue could have similar configurations.\nOttonomy IO partners with Harbor Lockers\nThrough a new partnership with Harbor Lockers, the latest generation of Ottobot can now be configured with a payload of Harbor Lockers. This includes the Harbor Locker physical locker infrastructure, as well as the Harbor Locker application interface.\nThis is the first time that Ottonomy is partnering with a third-party vendor to extend the autonomous last-mile delivery solution.\nLawn-mowing robots arrive in North America\nCES is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics shows. While The Robot\u00a0Report doesn\u2019t typically cover consumer robotics, it is notable that lawn-mowing robotics were ubiquitous at CES this year, with a dozen vendors showing their autonomous systems.\nThe European market for consumer lawnmowers is already mature, but the North American market is in the early stages of adoption. Without testing all of the different lawnmowing robots, it\u2019s difficult to determine the market leaders, but the two most promising solutions that I saw at the show included the new Yarbo Lawn Mower and the latest generation of Navimow from Segway Robotics.\nmowers-navimow\nMike Oitzman is Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the Mobile Robot Guide.

If you think back to about 20 years ago, it was a different story. Robot vacuums were a thing but they were much less common in households. These days, you can find robot vacuums in many people\u2019s homes, and across every price point with a varying degree of features. Many of them offer similar functions but at the same time, can be unique in more than a few ways. All of them have one thing in common though.\nThey all use a combination of sensors and lidar tech to capture a map of your home and then use that to navigate and clean up. Enter Matic, a robot vacuum that was announced at CES this week. It swaps all of that out for five cameras powered by computer vision to visually see where it\u2019s cleaning. The reason this is a big deal is because Matic, the company of the same name that created this little cleaning bot, says it solves the two biggest problems that other robot vacuums have. They can get stuck or lost more often than you\u2019d like. Matic apparently doesn\u2019t have these issues.\nIt won\u2019t get lost because the 5 cameras will allow it to see all of its surroundings. It knows where it\u2019s going at all times and is less likely to bump into anything. The computer vision meanwhile, helps it learn over time to make it smarter. Learning when the best times to clean are. It also has big wheels on the front to help it roll over any floor surface. So high pile rugs shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\nNor should other things that it might encounter as it rolls around your home sucking up dirt and debris. Cables, shoes, a coffee mug. If these things are sitting around on the floor the cameras will see it, Matic says, and the vacuum will simply move around that area.\nThis bot has a trick up its sleeve \u2013 it can clean up liquid spills\nIf there\u2019s one thing robot vacuums need improvement on, it\u2019s mopping. A lot of the models out today have variants with a built-in mop. But most of them won\u2019t do as good of a job as you hope and none of them can actually clean up liquid spills. Matic can. The unique way it was designed allows it to roll forward with the vacuum head sucking up dirt and debris. If it comes across a liquid spill or a spot that needs mopping, and then the vacuum head lowers as Matic changes into mop mode, and it rolls over that area to clean it up.\nIt also stores all of the liquid, dirt, and debris in the same bag. You do have to empty the bag yourself, but only once every month or so. You just open up the top lid and pull the bag out and toss it, then replace the bag so it\u2019s ready again. The idea is that Matic is a completely autonomous robot vacuum (other than emptying the bag) that doesn\u2019t need input from you whether it\u2019s to start a clean or set up a schedule. It\u2019ll just clean on its own and get better at doing it the more it cleans.\nMatic is a unique robot vacuum that offers features that set it apart from every other robot vacuum on the market. And that\u2019s why Matic has earned the Best of CES 2024 award. Matic will begin shipping in March and pre-orders are already up on the Matic website. It retails for a discounted price of $1,495 if you pre-order.\nCopyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Highlights: Smartphones, Transparent TVs, Robots and More!\nRead in other languages:\nCES 2024, officially running until January 12, has already unveiled a plethora of announcements in Las Vegas. The tech show displayed a wide range of new technology\u2014from AI and smart homes to robots and modern electric cars. Honestly, it gave us a glimpse into what 2024 might look like, with technology smoothly improving our everyday lives. Let's delve into some of the standout highlights from CES 2024.\nThinking about a phrase I read, '2023 is the new 2019', made me realize how the unusual lifestyle we got used to during the pandemic is slowly going away.\u00a0This shift in perspective was also apparent among our team covering CES in Las Vegas this year.\nThe event\u00a0halls buzzed with energy as numerous companies made their return, creating a\u00a0positive atmosphere. But beyond the bustling scene, what about the products unveiled in the iconic venues of Las Vegas?\nIt's been a while since I've seen such a vibrant array of valuable and intriguing products at CES. Moreover, this year's event underscores the tech industry's commitment to enhancing consumer experiences with day-to-day technology. In this article highlighting CES 2024, I've curated a selection of products that I believe could become integral to our lives in the coming year.\nCES 2024 Highlights:\nSmartphones and Related Products at CES\nWell, CES is not the place where we normally see smartphone releases\u2014big companies hold their own events at different moments of the year. However, we have a bunch of products surrounding the phone ecosystems.\nSamsung\nStarting with Samsung, which had a significant keynote at CES 2024, covering nearly every area of consumer technology this year. In the realm of phones, there were two notable product releases. First, Samsung introduced a feature allowing a Galaxy smartphone to be used as a webcam on PCs, integrating with Microsoft Teams. This feature, expected to launch later in the year, will support both front and rear-facing cameras and include options for background blur and auto-framing in your camera feed. It should function similarly to the Google Pixel 8 webcam support we tested.\nSecondly, the Korean company also unveiled a concept display\u00a0for a\u00a0flip phone, with a flexible screen that folds in both directions. This concept particularly piques my curiosity.\nSamsung and Google\nSamsung was also highlighted in a partnership with Google, promising to enhance file and media content sharing on Galaxy phones and other Android devices through the Quick Share feature, previously known as Android Nearby Share. Quick Share is compatible with a wider range of devices, including smart TVs. Additionally, Google is collaborating with LG to integrate the new Quick Share into future Windows PCs.\nSatechi\nNow, if you rely on technology to match your fast-paced lifestyle, accessories are likely essential for you. I've noticed three companies excelling in iPhone accessories at CES. Satechi stands out with its latest Qi2 charging stands, that offer a 15-watt wireless charging capability, compatible with Apple's Qi2-enabled MagSafe phones. The first thing that caught my attention was the elegant design.\nOtterBox\nFurthermore, riding the wave of Apple's sustainable approach to phone accessories, my second spotlight is on OtterBox. This company has introduced new cases crafted from sustainable cactus leather. OtterBox claims these cases mimic the feel of traditional leather\u00a0but are made from the more ethical and sustainable cactus material.\nAnker\nAnother company that introduced stylish wireless chargers with MagSafe compatibility is Anker. Their Anker MagGo Wireless Charger Series supports Qi2 and offers a 15-watt wireless charging capability.\nAsus, TCL and Oukitel\nAlthough I previously stated that CES isn't the ideal platform for smartphone releases, companies like Asus, TCL, and Oukitel did launch new phones in Las Vegas. TCL unveiled seven new models, with the TCL 50 Series standing out for its affordable 5G capabilities. Oukitel introduced the WP33 Pro, notable for its robust design and a large 22,000 mAh battery, claimed to last up to a week on a single charge.\nAnd finally: Asus\u00a0showcased the\u00a0ROG Phone 8 Series\u00a0featuring a major redesign. This series, aimed at gamers, integrates the powerful\u00a0Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC and a redesigned cooling system, making it a great Android device for gaming enthusiasts. An in-depth review of the Asus ROG Phone 8 Series will be coming soon.\nWearables Featured at CES\nSony\nTo keep this highlight overview article concise, I'm expanding the scope of this section on wearables. Let's start with Sony teasing a virtual reality system for creating and editing 3D models, targeting professionals in 3D design. That said, I can see it as a potential rival to the Apple Vision Pro. The system features a headset with a flip-up front for easy switching between virtual and real worlds, and it comes with unique controllers for enhanced interaction.\nAsus\nAsus also unveiled a pair of wearable display glasses: the AirVision M1. They boast a 1080p Micro OLED display with a wide 57-degree field of view for an immersive experience. Unique features include a touchpad on the left temple for easy display control and the option to anchor the screen in a set position. Although the name echoes Apple Vision Pro, these glasses are more akin to Google's past offerings\u2014don't you think?\u00a0The price and availability of the AirVision M1 remain under wraps.\nSennheiser\nIn the realm of headphones, Sennheiser has introduced three new models. The Momentum True Wireless 4 stands out as Sennheiser's most powerful earphones to date, boasting an enhanced sound profile with lossless aptX sound quality and exceptionally low latency. The Sennheiser Momentum Sport is specifically designed for athletic use, featuring a built-in PPG sensor that measures heart rate and body temperature. Lastly, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus offers an impressive battery life, delivering up to 50 hours on a single charge.\nJabra\nJabra has released significant updates for its Elite series wireless earbuds. The Elite 8 Active (review) and Elite 10 (review) now feature an easy-to-use toggle for Adaptive ANC, HearThrough, and Sidetone, along with new voice tone prompts. Additionally, the Elite 8 Active's Adaptive ANC\u00a0has been enhanced for better performance in windy conditions due to advanced wind noise detection. These updates can be accessed\u00a0via the Sound+ app.\nPower Stations at CES\nEcoflow\nEcoflow unveiled an innovative power station at CES 2024, the Ecoflow Delta Pro Ultra. It has a large 6 kWh capacity and delivers 7,200 W of power. The device is designed to work with the new Smart Home Panel 2, enabling the connection of up to three units to your home's electrical grid. This setup can increase your power capacity to as much as 90 kWh.\nAnker\nAt CES, Anker introduced the SOLIX C800 Plus, a portable power station with 768 Wh capacity. Its standout feature is a rapid charging ability, enabling it to fully charge in just 58 minutes. According to Thomas Kern, our specialist on power stations, this is a reliable energy alternative for campers.\nAnker has also launched the Solix F3800, a large power station with a 3,840 Wh capacity. First introduced in September 2023, it offers 6,000 W and 13 connectivity options. The Solix F3800 also allows for expansion with up to six extra batteries, enhancing its versatility and power capacity.\nPremier TVs Unveiled at CES\nSamsung\nEvery respectable tech show, including CES, features displays prominently, and this year was no exception. Samsung garnered significant attention by unveiling the first transparent micro LED TV. While transparent TVs aren't entirely new, Samsung's micro-LED version sets them apart. The video demonstration highlights its sharp, colorful picture quality and frameless design. Would you want one of these in your living room?\nTelly and ChatGPT\nStill on the TV topic: Telly, known for offering free 55-inch 4K TVs with ads on a secondary screen, is unveiling \"Hey Telly,\" a voice assistant based on OpenAI's ChatGPT. This feature, accessible on the TV's lower screen, aims to learn and recognize users, providing personalized recommendations. The goal of \"Hey Telly\" is to make the TV an interactive, valuable part of the family. That's right! I do have mixed feelings about it, and you?\nSmart Home and Vacuum Cleaners from CES\nMatic\nCES can be overwhelming with its array of smart home products. My favorite up to now is\u00a0Matic, a fully autonomous vacuum cleaner robot capable of handling both dry and wet messes. It utilizes computer vision to distinguish various messes and surfaces, seamlessly transitioning between mopping and vacuuming. Developed by two former Google engineers, Matic is responsive to voice commands and gestures. While there's significant hype surrounding it, Matic appears to surpass standard vacuum systems in functionality and efficiency.\nRoborock\nOn a related note, Roborock has introduced two new top models in their S8 series: the S8 MaxV Ultra and the S8 Max Ultra. Earlier this week, our team covered the differences between these three vacuum robots, all equipped with mopping functionality. For a clear understanding of how the two new models differ from the S8 Pro Ultra, I recommend reading the comparison article we provided.\nMost Unusual New Products Debuted at CES\nWithings\nCES 2024 unveiled some innovative products, including the Withings BeamO, a versatile, portable health device. It features a range of functions like measuring body temperature through the temporal artery, a digital stethoscope for heart and lung sounds, an ECG, and blood oxygen level (SpO2) monitoring. Unique to BeamO is its telemedicine aspect, allowing doctors to remotely review patient health data, reflecting a shift towards more connected healthcare solutions.\nLG\nThat said, Samsung and LG have showcased some of the most captivating devices at CES so far: robots designed for home and pet monitoring.\nLG introduced a smart home \"AI agent,\" blending AI, autonomous mobility, and conversational capabilities. This robot can manage various tasks, from controlling smart home appliances to ensuring security. Its unique two-legged wheel design adds a pet-like appeal, aiding in home navigation. Additionally, its AI technology enables interactions with people and understanding of context and intentions, enhancing its effectiveness as a home assistant.\nSamsung\nThe same excitement surrounds Samsung\u2019s Ballie robot. Unveiled at CES 2024, this updated version marks a significant evolution from its initial debut at CES 2020. A standout feature of the new Ballie is its integrated projector, capable of displaying images on various surfaces, such as floors, walls, and ceilings, while it moves alongside the user.\nIn the teaser below, you can witness some of Ballie's capabilities, such as projecting videos for pets, displaying video calls on wall surfaces, and even showing workout videos for fitness enthusiasts. Mirroring the behavior of a loyal pet\u2014not that I have one\u2014, Ballie can also follow users throughout the home, offering a warm greeting as they enter the door. However, it's important to note that details regarding Ballie's release date and pricing remain undisclosed at this point.\nThat's it! Those are some of the highlights of CES 2024. Of course, there were many more announcements related to different categories that we don't usually cover at nextpit, like Electric Vehicles and Gaming, which I believe deserve your attention. However, in this article I wanted to select some of the technologies that are tangible for you in 2024\u2014I would definitely like to test the Samsung Ballie robot if possible. And you?\nPlease share with us which devices you liked the most from this list and, of course, the ones that weren't even mentioned here. I'm also curious to know more about your personal view of CES 2024.\nTop Smart Speaker with Alexa\nCamila Rinaldi Head of Editorial\nWith over 10 years of reviewing smartphones and wearables, I recently became addicted to smart home gadgets. Even though I dove into the Apple ecosystem two years back, Android remains as one of my passions. Previously editor-in-chief of AndroidPIT and Canaltech in Brazil, I now write for the US market. I love my records and I believe that the best way to get to know a place is through its food.\nBy clicking on the button above, you agree that external content may be displayed to you.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nIs this the future of robot vacuums?\nMatic, a new cleaning robot, is becoming generally available, with orders shipping in early 2024, after gathering almost $30 million in funding. The biggest advantage the Matic has over existing home cleaning robots is the use of autonomous technology.\nMuch like a robotaxi \"knows\" what to do while it moseys around city streets, the Matic can wander around your home autonomously, finding messes to clean up and even taking voice and gesture orders of what to clean and where.\nAlso: The best robot mops of 2023: Expert tested and reviewed\nIts outside is the first feature that is certain to capture your eye. The Matic looks different from other robot vacuums and mops on the market. Like MO from WALL-E, the Matic looks like a small robot holding a cleaning brush. Also like MO, Matic mops up messes until they're completely gone, unlike other robot mops that just scrub over them on their way to completing their route.\n\"You'd think that the so-called \"smart robots\" in our home would be able to navigate the terrain and handle cleaning without getting shoelaces stuck in their bristles, chewing wires, and bumping into everything,\" Navneet Dalal, Matic's CEO and co-founder shared in a blog post.\nDalal was the co-founder of Flutter, an AI startup acquired by Google in 2013. Mehul Nariyawala, another Matic co-founder, was also a co-founder at Flutter and worked with Dalal in the Like.com early team, a startup also acquired by Google in 2010.\nAlso: This robot litter box changed my life, and it's on sale now\n\"Matic is the first AI-driven indoor robot that can expertly navigate any home to clean like a human,\" Dalal continues. Matic uses 5-RGB cameras that feed data into its neural networks to power image recognition, decision-making, and 3D mapping. This is all done on-device, not sent to a cloud service to process it.\nEverything the Matic learns -- the shape of your room, where your furniture is, what chair your kid's favorite stuffy is under -- all of this stays private inside the Matic and inside your home.\nOn its own, Matic is intelligent, albeit artificially, of course. Its eyes, or cameras, can view the world in color; its ears, or microphones, can listen to instructions from people around it; and its brain, or neural networks, process the visual and audio input to determine if what the Matic is seeing is a coffee stain or a sock; voice and visual recognition also help it understand if it hears \"clean here\" and sees someone pointing to a specific area.\nAlso: The best robot vacuum deals in November 2023\nThe Matic also learns over time, improving the neural network's ability to recognize its environment and interact with it.\nOn the inside, instead of a dustbin, the Matic has a HEPA bag that can hold a week's worth of dust and debris with daily vacuuming and a brush roll. Instead of mop pads, it will have a mop roll. It also has a water tank that can hold 600mL. A Matic Membership for $180 will ensure customers have replacement bags and brush and mop rolls.\nI was just talking to someone the other day about what our kids' robot vacuums will look like, especially looking back at our parents' vacuum cleaners. I wouldn't know what to do with a bag vacuum from the 70s, but I can work the ins and outs of almost any robot vacuum and mop.\nAlso: The best robot vacuums: Expert tested and reviewed\nIn my aspirational Jetsons life, I'd imagine an autonomous Rosie-like robot with a built-in virtual assistant like Amazon Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant, that can vacuum and mop, self-empty its dustbin, and is connected to the household's plumbing for ultimate convenience. It's only a matter of time to see how much of the Matic influences the future of robot vacuums and mops.\nIn order to start shipping orders in early 2024, Matic was financially backed by major investors and AI experts, including prominent tech names like former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, Stripe co-founders John and Patrick Collison, and Cue co-founder Daniel Gross.\nThe Matic will be available for the introductory price of $1,495 (down from its $1,795 retail price) and will include a year of Matic membership, valued at $180.\nRelated\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThis robot window cleaner from Ecovacs is what CES is all about\nRoborock unveils its newest fleet of robot vacuums at CES"

Some of the best robot vacuum lineups are getting upgraded with new AI cleaning capabilities while entirely new models debut with expansive functionality. There's no shortage of innovation with new concepts from manufacturers like Eufy, Roborock, Samsung, and more.\nI've rounded up the 7 most promising robot vacuums from the year's biggest tech show just below. These robovacs are designed to save you even more time throughout your day and clean even deeper than before. In addition to new smart app features, the models below make mechanical advancements in design and cleaning efficiency with additions like robotic arms.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\n7 best robot vacuums of CES 2024\n1. RoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is Roborock\u2019s most intelligent hybrid robot vacuum and mop. It automates the entire cleaning process as it navigates each room and dodges obstacles. The robot automatically returns to its compact docking station to empty its dirt bin, refill its mop, and charge up its battery. On top of that, the base cleans itself and washes the mop with hot water then a blow dry to ensure everything is clean and prevent odors.\u00a0This Roborock variant can even be connected directly to plumbing pipes to provide the robot with clean water and drainage without you having to fill up and empty tanks.\nRoborock's built-in AI powers a voice assistant, uses cameras to recognize messes then adjusts its cleaning settings, and avoids obstacles without relying on another device or the internet. Plus it supports the Matter protocol to work with any smart home ecosystem going forward. Hell, this gadget can even cruise around your house to act as a security camera or take video calls while you're away from home. But it's the S8 Max V's FlexiArm robotic arm that steals the show. This side brush extends and cleans corners effectively, while paired with a spinning side mop that will clean near edges. Corners and edges are the most challenging areas for robot vacuums to deep clean.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra will be available from Roborock for $1,800 this April.\n2. Eufy Clean X10 Pro Omni\nEufy's 2-in-1 x10 Pro Omni robot vacuum packs powerful suction and plenty of mopping pressure to tackle messes that range from fine powder like flour to breaking up mud caked onto your flooring. Its new pentagon-shaped body and mopping pads rotate 360 degrees and are designed to fit tight corners. This flagship model also has its own maintenance base complete with a mop washer and dryer.\nWith that said, the x10 Pro Omni is stacked with self-care features and implements cutting-edge smart navigation and AI mapping for half the price of the Roborock above. Its \"See Smart Obstacle Avoidance\" technology recognizes over 100 different kinds of household objects, including toys, cables, shoes and even dog poop accurately. That's because it's powered by the same algorithm used by the car industry's autonomous driving technology. Additionally, the LED sensor ensures a smooth, accurate clean even when operating in dark or low-light rooms.\nAlthough simple, one of the x10 Pro Omni's exciting new app features allows you to set up cleaning profiles. One example eufy showed off is \"after dinner cleaning\" whereby the robovac automatically cleans one particular area of the home, like a kitchen or dining room at a scheduled time. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni will be available on Amazon and Eufy.com on February 20, 2024 for $799.99.\n3. Narwal Freo X Ultra\nNarwal's new flagship Freo X Ultra is a smart robot vacuum and mop that's powerful yet operates quietly. Its 3.2L capacity can compress up to 60 days of dust inside of the vacuum itself. This is potentially going to be one of the best robot vacuums for pet owners due to its Zero-Tangling Floating Brush which captures 95% of hair without getting tangled up. Thanks to its aerodynamic engineering the brush strategically positions each strand to create airflows that prevent tangles.\nThe Freo's onboard computer uses AI to power Narwal's DirtSense technology. This monitors water usage during mopping to identify heavily soiled areas on the home map. DirtSense tells the robovac to repeatedly hit these spots and can assess its performance based on the cleanliness level of the water. The robot thoroughly mops down troublesome areas until DirtSense sees the water readings improve.\nThe Narwal Freo X Plus ($469) has many of the same features as the X Ultra, save for the self-cleaning base station. Both models will be released on Narwal.com in March.\n4. Eureka J20\nEureka\u2019s RollRenew Mopping System continuously keeps the Eureka J20 robot vacuum fresh while it cleans your floors. This technology works by spraying the mop with fresh water from five nozzles. While this keeps mops sopping wet, the scraper squeezes out the dirty water into an integrated 250ml wastewater tank \u2014 so that once the mop passes over your dirty floors, its surface comes back as clean as when it started.\nThis ingenious cycling belt and water tank system keeps the J20 wet yet clean at all times so that it can wash your entire floor. While it lacks cameras, the J20's precise laser navigation lets the vacuum quickly comprehend your home's layout and detect obstacles with ease. If your home has carpet the bot has an advanced ultrasonic carpet detection system that flips the mop over to a non-fabric side. Once it returns to its all-in-one base station its integrated ventilation system uses a built-in fan to ensure air circulation to keep it clean and prevent odor buildup.\nThe Eureka J20's release information and pricing will be available later this year.\n5. Deebot X2\nThe Deebot X2 Combo is Ecovac's first whole-home cleaning system that adds a handheld vacuum (with upholstery and multi-surface attachments) to the X2 OMNI robot vacuum, mop, and auto-empty station. This combines a closet's worth of cleaning tools into a single gadget to save space in your home. Unlike standard robot vacuums, the X2 ditches a round profile for a square design for edge-to-edge cleaning precision that covers 99.8% more ground surface in a single job.\nIts 8000Pa suction power rips through dirt and debris while the mop can scrub stains away and lift from hard floors to carpet. The X2 COMBO boasts all of the X2 OMNI\u2019s navigation and smart home features, including an embedded navigation system for a greater range of motion, fast mapping, and faster response times. Its \"True Detect 3D 2.0\" technology scans and precisely avoids obstacles in your room. And like the Roborock it has a responsive voice control system and other smart home capabilities.\nWith Matter 1.2 now available, the X2 COMBO will be Matter-ready out of the box, so it will work with any smart home ecosystem once certified. You can get the Deebot X2 Combo for $1,599 in March.\n6. DreameBot X30 Ultra\nThis robot vacuum prioritizes convenience above all else with its 7-in-1 function self-cleaning base station and option for a home water hookup. Its two built-in scrapers clean the base station as it enters and exits the dock. Meanwhile, the mop is washed and dried with hot air after each job.\nDesigned to be nimble and fit under step edges and doorframes, the DreameBot x30 has an expansive FlexArm that reaches as far as 4cm deep into nooks and crannies for a more thorough clean. The X30 Ultra uses intelligent 3D mapping and path planning smart navigation technology to create an efficient, customized cleaning route for every room. Built-in sensors work continuously while the robot moves to detect and avoid up to 70 types of obstacles, including cables, shoes and pets.\nThe compact X30 Ultra will be available for pre-order starting\u00a0Feb. 28, 2024, in the U.S. via\u00a0Dreame's official website\u00a0and Dreame's official\u00a0Amazon store\u00a0with prices beginning at\u00a0$1,699.99.\n7. Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\nSamsung's Bespoke Jet Bot Combo is the company's first all-in-one floor washer that uses on-board AI to identify floor types, avoid objects, and spot stains on your hard floor or carpet. Once it\u2019s detected a stain on a hard floor, it\u2019ll travel back to its cleaning station to warm up its mop pads with high-temperature steam and water before returning to the mess. This heat pairs with high-speed spinning mops to scrub off the toughest of grime.\nOnce the AI detects carpets it automatically lifts the mop's attachments or removes and stores them back at the base. The self-emptying and cleaning charging base not only refills the bots tank but also steam washes the mops to keep them clean and prevent odors. Plus it also cleans and dries the mop as well.\nThis model is still in development with features subject to change. Its current model the JetBot AI+ retails for $1,300 for reference but lacks mopping capabilities.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

And it\u2019ll only cost you $1,800.\nBy\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reviewer who's been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus.\nShare this story\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nThe Matic is a new robot vacuum with a different approach to cleaning your floors. Built by two former Google Nest engineers, it\u2019s designed to move around your home in the same way most humans would, processing things visually instead of spatially. It uses five RGB cameras to navigate, rather than the sensors, bumpers, and lidar tech found on most of today\u2019s robot vacs. In theory, this makes it less prone to common robot vacuum pitfalls \u2014such as high-pile rugs, cables, and tight spaces \u2014 because it can actually see where it\u2019s going in real time rather than relying on a preprogrammed map. It also operates locally \u2014 with no cloud component at all. Mapping is done on the device, and it doesn\u2019t require an internet connection to run, so your data should never leave your home.\nFollowing initially launching as a subscription model earlier this year, Matic is now being sold outright. You can preorder it at maticrobots.com for the discounted price of $1,495 (regularly $1,795), with delivery planned for March 2024. I\u2019ve not had a chance to see or test the new robot, but the demo footage I\u2019ve seen has impressed me.\nMatic has been in development for six years \u2014 since its founders, Mehul Nariyawala and Navneet Dalal, left Google Nest to put their combined experience in developing facial recognition and gesture detection at startup Flutter into tackling the problem of creating a truly autonomous home robot cleaner.\n\u201cWe\u2019re both dads, and I have a Golden Retriever, and we were just not impressed with the abilities of most robot vacuums to keep our house clean,\u201d Nariyawala\u00a0told The Verge in an interview. So they set out to build a better bot.\nRelated\nThe key difference, says Nariyawala, who worked with Dalal on Google\u2019s Nest Cam IQ cameras and Nest Hello doorbell, is that Matic creates a 3D-powered, street-view-like map of your home that, combined with on-device computer vision, allows it to maneuver around in the same way a self-driving car might traverse a city guided by Google Maps.\nInstead of bumping into chair legs or sniffing at shoes as most robot vacuums do today, Matic glides around any clutter you leave on the floor as it switches between vacuuming up debris and mopping up spills. \u201cHardware has never been the bottleneck of robots; it\u2019s the brains, the ability to map and navigate, go from point A to point B precisely, 10 out of 10 times that hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d says Nariyawala. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve solved.\u201d\nThe Matic also doesn\u2019t look like the circular robot vacs we\u2019re used to. With a square, squat white body, big wheels, and a vacuum head that extends out, it\u2019s more Wall-E than Roomba. It can also \u201cmimic human perception and self-learning through cameras and Neural Networks that power image recognition, decision making, and 3D mapping,\u201d said Dalal in a blog post.\nThis semantic understanding brings a higher level of AI-powered obstacle avoidance, the company claims, allowing it to navigate any object in your home on the fly. While competitors like iRobot and Ecovacs have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, Nariyawala says Matic can identify far more items than the competition, categorizing them into dirt, non-dirt, and unknown, the last two of which it will avoid.\nMatic can respond to gestures and commands like \u201cMatic, clean up there\u201d\nCapable of both mopping and vacuuming, the Matic is also a wet / dry vac, so it can clean up liquid spills as well as dirt \u2014 something no other robot vacuum is capable of.\u00a0Its computer vision allows it to identify different floor types and autonomously switch from vacuuming to mopping, says Nariyawala. It avoids mopping your carpets by vacuuming when going forward and then flipping its head down to mop when it moves backward.\nAnother unique feature is gesture commands. The Matic has a speaker and microphones on board and should be able to respond to commands such as \u201cMatic, clean up there\u201d or \u201cMatic, go mop the bathroom.\u201d It can also autonomously go out and find dirty areas of your home and clean them. According to Nariyawala, every couple of hours, it will roam around and seek out dirt. \u201cEventually, it will learn your preferences and know things like after dinner, it should clean the kitchen,\u201d he says.\nWhen its onboard bin is full, it goes and parks itself by your trash can and sends you an alert that it\u2019s ready to be emptied. The bin is a small bag you pull out and throw away. It has a one-liter capacity that Matic says can hold up to a month\u2019s worth of dust or a week\u2019s worth of dust and liquid.\nIt\u2019s also very, very quiet. Nariyawala claims Matic has the same efficacy as an upright vacuum but doesn\u2019t get louder than 55db. That\u2019s the quietest level of almost any robot vacuum I\u2019ve tested, and none can get a carpet as clean as an upright can.\u00a0The key here, according to Nariyawala, is that suction power isn\u2019t as important as agitation and the capability of the brush roll to get up dirt. That theory is one that\u2019s held up in my testing of robot vacs.\nTwo tank-like front wheels allow the Matic to go over high-pile rugs and room transitions without getting stuck, and its mopping pad is a roller mop inside the robot that squeegees itself clean so you don\u2019t have to.\nThe robot doesn\u2019t have a big docking station that empties its bin or refills its water tank, as is popular on most high-end robots today; you have to do that yourself. Instead, it carries around a 600ml water tank and a one-liter-capacity bin.\nMatic has tried to make disposal as simple and mess-free as possible. Both liquid and dirt go into the same bag where \u201cdiaper crystals\u201d absorb any liquid, and you just throw the sealed bag in the bin. An optional Matic membership ($15 a month) gets you a steady supply of bags, brushes, and mop rolls and guarantees you coverage for accidental damage.\nNow that we\u2019ve talked about the vacuum prowess, let\u2019s look a little closer at how it actually works. With its AI-powered navigation and cleaning capabilities, Nariyawala says it can adapt to dirt and situations on the fly. If there\u2019s a big stain on the floor, it will mop back and forth until it\u2019s gone, and if it spots popcorn, it will slow down the roller head speed so as not to spray little white kernels all over the room. \u201cWhen it sees rug tassels Matic will reduce suction power so it doesn\u2019t suck them up,\u201d he says.\nThe navigation system does use simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, found on most high-end vacuums, but Nariyawala says the Matic has 10 times better implementation thanks to its semantic understanding powered by software algorithms and data processing on the edge.\nWatching a demo of the Matic in action, its navigation skills remind me of Amazon\u2019s Astro home robot, which also makes quick, autonomous navigation decisions. Both move more freely around your home than a robot vacuum, which tends to move in a straight line until it meets an obstacle and then has to readjust once it figures out what the obstacle is and what it should do about it.\nOn paper, the Matic does appear to address two of the biggest problems of today\u2019s robot vacuums: getting stuck or lost and being too loud to get the job done. Even the smartest bots today can get foiled by obstacles like rug tassels or debris like popcorn, and every robot will get turned off by an annoyed family member trying to watch TV while it barrels through vacuuming as loud as a blender.\nThe way the Matic switches between mopping and vacuuming to avoid damp rugs is an interesting solution, but how effective it will be compared to the oscillating mop pads on some bots today remains to be seen. Its ability to suck up wet spills is a first, however. (Well, and keep functioning after it\u2019s done so!)\nEven at the introductory price of $1,495, Matic is going to be a hard sell\nKeeping everything local has a big appeal from a privacy standpoint. Currently, if you want to run a robot vacuum with no cloud connection, you lose its mapping abilities (unless you do a lot of hacking). The downside is this limits smart home integrations. There are no plans to support Amazon Alexa or Google Home at launch, although Nariyawala tells me they are exploring Matter integration down the line.\nEven at the introductory price of $1,495, Matic is going to be a hard sell. The only other robot vacuum close to that price is the excellent Dreame L20 Ultra, but that is regularly on sale. Amazon\u2019s Astro home robot costs $1,600 and doesn\u2019t vacuum. But Nariyawala says this is Matic 1.0, \u201cWe\u2019re taking a Tesla-like approach, introducing a high-end version with plans to bring more affordable models to market.\u201d\nWith former Tesla engineers working for Matic and financial backing from Nest co-founder Matt Rogers, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, and AI expert and ex-CEO of GitHub Nat Friedman (among others), the potential is definitely here. But whether this will all add up to a giant step forward in home robotics remains to be seen. I\u2019ll have to get the Matic in my own home to test it before I can give any verdict, but the concept is intriguing and feels like a step closer to the Rosie the Robot of my smart home dreams.\nMatic is available to preorder starting today at maticrobots.com for an introductory price of $1,495 (savings of $300) and includes a yearlong Matic membership ($180 value).

        "raw_content": "The Future Of Home Robots: What CES 2024 Revealed\nFew tech demos can match the spectacle of robotics. Even as the field grows increasingly prevalent in a broad range of industrial workplaces, mechatronics doing impressive things will never cease to amaze. For many, the mere presence of a robot is shorthand for the future, and for big electronics firms, it\u2019s a quick and simple method to let shareholders and customers know your company is still innovating.\nKey Takeaway\nThe future of home robots, as revealed at CES 2024, presents a shift towards more realistic and achievable goals, focusing on versatile platforms that can evolve to offer a wide range of functionalities beyond traditional cleaning tasks.\nThe Return of Ballie\nAt CES 2024, one of the highlights was the \u201creturn\u201d of Ballie, which demonstrated that Samsung hasn\u2019t lost interest in the home robot. The spherical home patrolling \u2019bot, which now contains a projector, is a more realistic vision for home robots near-term. While the actual market availability of Ballie remains uncertain, it presents a perfectly achievable goal for the future of home robotics.\nThe Evolution of Robot Vacuums\nOver the past 20+ years, the home robot market has predominantly featured robot vacuums, with the first Roomba setting the standard in late 2002. While newer iterations have shown significant improvements in functionality, the market still revolves around single-purpose robots designed for specific tasks such as vacuuming and mopping.\nChallenges and Opportunities\nSecurity and mobility have been identified as potential applications for home robots, with companies like Amazon and Matic exploring these areas. However, limited functionality and prohibitive price points have posed challenges for widespread adoption. The quest for a versatile and affordable home robot continues, with the focus on developing a platform that can evolve to offer additional functionalities beyond basic cleaning tasks.\nThe Role of Generative AI\nGenerative AI is expected to have a profound impact on robotics, particularly in learning and natural language processing. While this technology holds promise for the development of general-purpose systems, its widespread integration into home robots may still be several years away.\nAge-Tech and Robotics\nJapan has been a leader in integrating robots into age tech, aiming to assist older individuals in living independently. Devices like Labrador\u2019s assistive cart system and the desktop ElliQ robot assistant have demonstrated the potential for robots to play a significant role in this space. With the aging population in many countries, targeting this demographic presents a promising opportunity for integrating robots into homes.\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nWhen Does Mortal Kombat 12 Come Out\nNext\nWhen Did Mortal Kombat X Come Out\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

        "raw_content": "All the Robots We Met At CES 2024, in One Place\nImprovements in AI are making robots more fun than ever.\nSome things in life are guaranteed: death and taxes, sure, but also that there will be robots at CES. I've met many robots at the Las Vegas tech show over the years -- I've even played Cards Against Humanity and table tennis against a couple of them -- and it's always been a highlight of the event for me.\nAs anticipated, the robots are back in force at CES 2024. Some have an element of personality to them, often through the inclusion of some kind of recognizable facial features, while others are just busy little autonomous machines with a job too. To our delight, many of them are making food and drink that we've been snaffling as we roam the convention center halls. Referring to these countertop machines as robots might have you asking what actually defines a robot -- but worry not, it's a question we answered all the way back at CES 2017.\nAn unfortunate side note: Most of the robots we've seen at CES never make it out of the show and into the wider world, and certainly not into our homes. The huge leaps forward in AI we've seen over the past few years give me hope that home robots may yet make the leap off the show floor. AI is fundamental to the functioning of autonomous machines such as robots, and more advanced AI could well lead to robots that are capable of doing more than trimming our lawns and vacuuming our floors.\nIn the meantime, here's the closest thing we currently have to what our robot overlords are up to this year.\nSamsung Ballie\nWe'll start the petition for Samsung to put Ballie on sale.\nThe return of Samsung's Ballie to CES didn't come as a surprise. First unveiled at CES 2020, Ballie disappeared for a few years before bouncing back new with a built-in projector.\nBallie is a combo of companion entertainer and security guard. It can follow you around your house with its wheels, analyze your posture using its camera and stream content for you. It's also bright yellow, making it cute and hopefully so visible that you don't trip over it in spite of its diminutive size.\nThe big question for Samsung is whether this cute little home robot will ever be more than a prop it brings out to delight during press conferences? There's no price or release date for Ballie at the moment, so don't get your hopes up.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\nSamsung's Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, awaiting a mess to clean up.\nBallie wasn't the only robot Samsung brought to CES this year (even if it was the most fun). The far more practical Bespoke Jet Bot Combo is an all-star mopping and vacuuming machine that can clean up your red wine spill without you even having to leave the sofa.\nWith its AI-powered object recognition, it knows where to go and where not to go. Samsung even promises that you can trust it do its thing without falling down the stairs. We love an independent queen.\nOro Dog Companion\nIf Oro can't solve the issue on its own, it will alert you remotely to your dog's most pressing needs.\nWhat's cuter than your dog? Absolutely nothing, of course. But with its baffled face and snowman-esque stature, the Oro Dog Companion is trying its best.\nAs well as two-way audio and video that allows you to keep an eye on and communicate with your pup while you're away from home, the Oro can play with your furry friend, feed them treats and learn about them to recognize signs of distress or restlessness. If you're worried about separation anxiety or simply want your pet to have the very best that money can buy, you can buy this robot soon for $799.\nLenovo Magic Bay Robot\nLenovo's Magic Bay Robot is certainly cute.\nWhether you work in an office or from home, computer-based jobs can be lonely gigs sometimes. Imagine, then, that you have a small friend perched atop your screen, ready to flash you a smile whenever you need it -- a sort of physical Clippy for the 21st century.\nLenovo's Magic Bay Robot will do just that -- and if we're honest, not much else right now. Lenovo brought this small webcam-shaped bot to CES as more of a proof of concept, showing off what could be a compact personal assistant in future, once loaded up with AI skills. It's a sweet idea that we're excited to see evolve further (roll on CES 2025).\nYarbo\nYarbo's here to save you on a snow day.\nMost robots are indoorsy creatures, vulnerable as they are to the elements. But there's an entire breed of bots that are built for outdoor work, and are therefore more rugged.\nEnter the burly, mononymous Yarbo, a modular robot that will shovel snow and blow leaves so you don't have to. Different attachments equip it to complete a range of outdoorsy tasks, allowing you to watch it from your window with a lovely warm cup of coffee. Such luxuries don't come cheap, of course. The body is $4,499, and additional components range from $1,499 to $2,459 in price.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

        "raw_content": "The best robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 go where Roombas still haven't\nThe robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 are ushering in a new era of automated at-home cleaning. And none of them are Roombas.\nLike Apple, iRobot doesn't do CES. Rather, the latest Roombas arrived in September 2023 and had a peaceful few months of (basically) being the best in the business. That's changing with the 2024 fleet of new flagship models from brands like Roborock, Samsung, Ecovacs, and Eufy, all of which showcased serious upgrades to their previous robot vacuums.\nWe're seeing a few recurring glow-ups that are setting new standards for ways a robot vacuum can make your life easier: Small obstacle avoidance (think phone chargers, socks, and pet waste) is non-negotiable at this point, but fully self-sufficient mopping \u2014 real elbow grease, AI-fueled stain detection, and automated washing and drying of mopping pads \u2014\u00a0is the clear theme of the year. Even the most advanced Roomba doesn't offer those last two bullet points.\nBelow, we're diving into the details of our favorite 2024 competitors, as well as hashing out the differences between the new models and their predecessors. We'll also give pricing and release date information if we have it.\nRoborock S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra\nIt feels like just yesterday (was October not last month?) that Roborock dropped its last bots of 2023, the Q5 Pro and Q8 Max series. However, Roborock operates on both its release schedule and the CES schedule, and there are yet again new Roborocks.\nThe more premium vacs of the two new series are the S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra. This series' main claim to fame is a bendy robotic arm that extends from the underside of the vacuum to detail spots that a side brush would miss \u2014\u00a0a longstanding blind spot of even the most powerful robot vacuums.\nA front-facing camera is also on board, which guides more meticulous small obstacle and stain detection and can livestream footage as it roves \u2014 technically giving you the ability to talk to someone who's at home by talking through the app.\nSmarts aside, we'd be remiss not to mention the enhanced suction power on these bad boys: the Max Ultra clocks 8,000 Pa while the S8 MaxV Ultra clocks a whopping 10,000 Pa \u2014\u00a0doubling the power of so many vacs on the current market that were previously thought to be pretty damn powerful.\nLike the S8 Pro Ultra, which was unveiled at last year's CES, the S8 Max Ultra and MaxV Ultra docks wash mop heads and dry them with warm air, then refill the water tank in the bot itself. If you'd prefer to also not be responsible for manually refilling the larger water tank in the dock itself, there is a version of both new S8s that can be hooked up directly to your home's drainage system.\nStarting in April 2024, the Roborock S8 Max Ultra will be available for $1,599.99 and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be available for $1,799.99.\nRoborock Q Revo Pro and Q Revo MaxV\nThe more affordable new series is the Q Revo line, with both the Revo Pro and Revo MaxV sticking close to the $1,000 price point. (The latter is more expensive due to the presence of a built-in voice assistant.)\nAside from aesthetic differences of the docks, the main difference from the S8 line is the Q Revo's focus on more detailed mopping than sheer suction power. It mops with two oscillating mopping pads spinning at 200 RPM (rather than the S8's singular pad) for a closer clean around obstacles like table legs.\nCompared to the S8 series, the new Revo models clean with 7,000 Pa of suction instead of 10,000 \u2014\u00a0still impressive \u2014\u00a0and are equipped with the same FlexiArm design to reach into corners. They also wash and dry the mopping pads.\nThe Q Revo Pro will go for $999.99 and the Q Revo MaxV will go for $1,199.99 when they become available for purchase in April 2024.\nEcovacs X2 Combo\nSpeaking of corner cleaning, Ecovacs is once again taking the literal route with another square robot vacuum \u2014\u00a0its second released in three months. After the Sept. 2023 drop of the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (a welcomed upgrade over the frustrating Deebot X1 Omni) Ecovacs has already found a unique way to build on its most advanced robot vacuum: adding a handheld vacuum to the ensemble.\nYes, \"Combo\" refers to a new docking station that charges the robot vacuum itself on one side and a cordless handheld vacuum on the other side \u2014\u00a0because we all know that there are some intricate messes that you'd prefer to tackle by hand. Both vacuums self-empty into the bi-directional dustbin in the middle.\nOther features seen in the X2 Omni that have carried over to the X2 Combo include mopping, washing and drying of the mopping pads, automatic water tank refilling, AI obstacle avoidance, and a voice assistant called Yiko that you can use to beckon the vacuum to wherever you're standing. Unlike the X2 Omni, the Combo is also Matter-ready, meaning it's compatible with several smart home systems.\nThe Ecovacs X2 Combo will cost $1,599 upon release, which is TBA but likely in the spring.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+\nSamsung's booth theme for CES 2024 \u2014 and the bigger theme for CES as a whole this year, apparently \u2014\u00a0is AI. More tangibly, Samsung's lean into AI is showcased in its new robot vacuum, the Bespoke Jet Combo AI+. Though it isn't Samsung's first robot vacuum with \"AI\" in the name, it does use AI in a major new way. On top of AI-powered smart mapping and AI-powered small obstacle detection, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ can also detect stains on hard floors without you having to designate a cleaning zone in the app.\nSo yes, Samsung's flagship robot vacuum finally mops. Once the Jet Bot finds a stain, the bot quickly returns to the dock to heat the mopping pads with hot enough water to create steam, then heads back to the problem spot to scrub, spinning at 170 RPM.\nIn line with the trend of fully automated mopping that we've been seeing, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ charges on a self-emptying dock that also auto-fills the Jet Bot's water tank and washes and dries the mop.\nPricing and a release date for the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ are still up in the air. Its predecessor, the Jet Bot AI+ that does not mop, debuted at $1,299.99 in 2021, so we expect the Combo AI+ to be slightly more expensive than that upon release.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nEufy's latest botvac doesn't necessarily do anything that we haven't seen before. It empties itself, mops with some elbow grease, washes and dries its mopping pads, and avoids obstacles like cords and socks. It's a solid checklist that's almost expected at this point in the game.\nWhat is groundbreaking about the X10 Pro Omni, though, is the fact that it secures all of those features for half the cost of multiple other vacuums in this list.\nWhile Ecovacs takes a break from using \"Omni\" in its robot vacuum names, Eufy's Omni era will undoubtedly change the game for the sub-$1,000 robot vacuum category. Despite debuting at a price point that's $100 less than its predecessor, the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni dishes out significantly stronger suction power (8,000 Pa versus the X9 Pro's 5,500 Pa) and cleans with a new edge-hugging feature for better baseboard and corner attention. It's also square-ish with rounded edges.\nLike the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni mops with dual spinning, pressurized mops that are fully lifted above carpeting and rugs when it's sensed. After mopping, the self-empty dock also washes and dries the mopping pads.\nThis packed checklist should cost way more than the mere $799.99 price that Eufy's asking, but we're not complaining. You can secure the X10 Pro Omni for yourself starting on Feb. 20.\nTopics\nCES\nRobot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers essential home tech like vacuums and TVs as well as sustainable swaps and travel.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nRobots are dominating at CES 2024 \u2014 these are the 9 best so far\nLawnmowers, pet sitters and a robot barista\nCES 2024 has been all about artificial intelligence, but one other trending technology has been giving AI a run for its money \u2014 robotics.\nWe\u2019ve seen home helpers that can watch your pets, lawnmowers that can customize cutting patterns and a delivery robot that can climb stairs.\nThere have been enough robot vacuum cleaners, mops and home appliances to get Skynet excited for the start of the rebellion, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anything without AI.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best robots at CES 2024\nTo get an idea of just how widespread the robot invasion of our homes, gardens and workspaces has become I\u2019ve pulled together a list of the 9 best robotic announcements so far at CES 2024.\n1. Ballie projects itself into your heart\nBefore CES even began Samsung declared it was all-in on AI. This includes using vision models to tell you what food to make based on the contents of your fridge, launching new large language models for its cellphones and bringing smart robots to your home.\nBallie is part entertainment device, part chatbot and part home assistant. The round robot can project things onto the floor, wall or ceiling as it follows you around the home like a lost puppy.\nThe yellow bot can also message its owner to give an update on the pets, manage smart tech in the home and even answer calls on your behalf.\nThe problem is right now it's nothing more than a video. When the first version of Ballie was unveiled in 2020 a model was whizzing around the stage. This year we\u2019ve only seen it in a video, with no details on price, launch or availability.\n2. LG smart home agent\nYou wait all day for a bus then two come along at once. Or in this case, you don\u2019t wait for a tiny, cute robot that can link up with your home appliances but two still come along at once.\nNot to be outdone by Samsung, LG revealed its smart home agent. An AI-packed little bot on two legs that rolls around your home keeping an eye on your smart tech, pets and you.\nLG\u2019s little agent is basically a smart hub that can move about. It has a built-in large language model voice assistant so you can communicate with it in much the same way you can with ChatGPT voice and it can monitor your mood.\nConnected through the LG smart home platform ThinQ, it can manage washers, ovens and even refrigerators unaided. It uses machine learning to understand how the family interacts and uses devices and can perform voice and facial analysis. Like Bailee it has no price, release data or physical model to try out.\n3. Rise of the lawnbot \u2014 Segway Navimow\nRobot lawnmowers aren't a new idea. They've been around about as long as the robot vacuum with new models and companies rising and falling.\nThis year at CES we've seen a multitude of mowers, blowers and other gardening aids and one of the highlights is the Segway Navimow.\nThe Navimow H Series has been available in Europe for some time but is now coming to the U.S. for the first time. It uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard and uses a small base station when GPS isn't available.\nThe H Series range features a BladeHalt sensor, a Rain sensor, an Ultrasonic sensor (H3000), and a VisionFence sensor (H3000), so it should be able to more easily detect and avoid objects on your lawn.\nPricing has not yet been made available for the U.S. market, but when it was released in Europe, the H500E was priced at \u20ac1,199 (about $1,300), the H800 was at \u20ac1,499, and the H3000E cost \u20ac2,499 (about $2,700).\n4. Oro is a buddy for your pets\nBoth Samsung's Ballie and the LG smart home agent boast pet-sitting capabilities, but the adorable big-eyed ORo from Ogmen Robotics goes a step further, being designed as a ball-throwing, food-delivering pet buddy.\nThe autonomous robot can take care of your dog when you're not at home. Priced at $799 and available from April it is fitted way a suit of sensors, two-way audio and an interactive video screen that lets you chat to your canine from anywhere.\nORo can also capture images and videos of your pet at play that you can then share online or keep to look back on. it also has a built-in food dispenser that can launch nibbles at your good boy and a separate automatic food bowl that the bot can control.\nOne of the most impressive features is its built-in AI that learns by watching the way your pet plays. It understands its behavior patterns and can play music or throw a ball when Rover becomes agitated or restless.\nORo is currently available for pre-order with a $299 downpayment with the remaining $500 due when it is ready to ship. It comes in cozy carbon and ivory mist. The price includes hte base-station, the dog bowl and the robot.\n5. Climbing up the stairs \u2014 MOBINN from RcLab\nThe MOBINN is a delivery robot with flexible wheels that allow it to drive on even ground and climb stairs while bringing you that parcel you need urgently.\nIt is a research example at the moment without a date for release or a price but it can maintain a constant and steady horizon for the main body ensuring the Starbucks you ordered doesn't spill on its way from the coffee shop down the street.\nThe M3 has a LiDAR-based mapping system to allow it to operate regardless of the terrain and can also work in rain, snow and at night.\n6. The Loona companion bot\nSometimes all you need to cheer you up is a pet but that isn't always practical. Enter Loona, the companion robot that uses ChatGPT to provide natural conversation with its owner.\nBuilt by Beijing KEYi Technology, the toy can play a range of interactive games, is a moveable home monitor and acts as a programming learning platform.\nThe cute little bot also includes gesture recognition technology, voice commands and graphic programming to allow users to create their own instructions.\nThe base model is $380 with a range of accessories and add-ons available including coding kits, game prop kits and a charging dock.\n7. Robot vacuum phone home\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to the ability to call its owner or have the owner call in remotely.\n6. Elderly companion robot\nIntuition Robotics is bringing generative AI to its elderly care companion robot ElliQ. The third generation of the bot, known as the ElliQ 3 uses AI to offer more engaging and two-way conversations for its users.\nSmaller and lighter than previous versions it also includes a screen fully integrated into the device rather than as a standalone tool.\nA built-in AI processing unit and a RAM increase also makes it easier to use and interact with as it can handle natural language conversations.\nIt also uses generative AI to better utilize information the user shares with the device such as favorite color, pet and religion. It can reference this information in conversations and choose activities based on user interests.\n7. A coffee making robot\nADAM is a robot barista from Richtech Robotics. Impressing at CES 2024 it can make hot or cold coffee with 21 unique menu offerings. It can also turn its hand to cold brew and Boba or mix up a cocktail.\nThe two-armed robot can interact with customers to take their order through a natural language interface, use its arms to make the drink and even wash up.\nEach arm can work independently to create two drinks at the same time and can be customized with different phrases depending on the use case or company.\nADAM is only available as a rental device for specific events. So far it is the main barista in a Manhattan coffee shop, served Boba at Cloutea on the Las Vegas strip and served drinks for Kendall Jenner at hte launch of her 818 Tequila signature bottle launch party.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.
