        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

(NYSE: JBL) today announced it is updating its outlook for fiscal 2024.\n\u201cDuring the final stretch of our first quarter, we experienced softening in demand, as a result of short-term inventory corrections across certain end-markets where we participate,\u201d said CEO Kenny Wilson.\nJabil now expects revenue to be in the range of $8.3 billion - $8.4 billion for the first fiscal quarter, slightly below the low end of its previously announced range, while the outlook for core earnings per share during the quarter is expected to be near the midpoint of the range provided on September 28th, 2023.\nJabil expects this inventory rebalancing to continue into its second fiscal quarter and as a result anticipates revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $7.0 billion - $7.6 billion.\nFor fiscal 2024, revenue is now expected to be approximately $31 billion, down 7 percent from the midpoint of previous guidance, while the company\u2019s outlook for core operating margin is expected to be within the previously provided guidance range of 5.3% - 5.5%, which will result in core earnings per share in excess of $9.00 for fiscal 2024.\n\u201cOver the past several years we have intentionally structured the company to be more reliable throughout a range of economic cycles. As a result, we expect Jabil\u2019s profitability to be more resilient, despite softer demand. This provides yet another proof point of Jabil\u2019s improved ability to navigate an economic downturn.

ChatGPT-enabled infotainment\nVolkswagen announced that it has integrated the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, ushering in a new era in automotive technology.\nThe advancement was enabled by the firm's collaboration with Cerene Inc. via its Chat Pro system. The feature will be offered in the current generation of Volkswagen models based on its MEB and MQB Evo platforms and those that use its IDA voice assistant.\nVolkswagen\nBy integrating with Cerence Chat Pro, the innovation enhances the functionalities of the IDA voice assistant. Users will be able to control a range of functions spanning from infotainment and navigation to air conditioning control, all using voice commands. Additionally, it can also provide answers to general questions, ending those in-car arguments.\nThe integration of ChatGPT through Cerence Chat Pro is designed with a focus on user privacy and data protection by excluding access to any vehicle-specific information.\nThis feature will be accessible across a range of Volkswagen models from early 2024, including the new Tiguan and Passat, the new Golf, and the ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.7.\n4. Honda's 'O' EV lineup\nThe Japanese automaker unveiled its 'Honda 0 Series', a new electric vehicle (EV) lineup set to hit North American roads from 2026 onwards. The company also unveiled a brand-new emblem for the iconic 'H mark'. The emblem will be exclusively reserved for the upcoming generation of EV models.\nTwo concept vehicles in the Honda 0 Series were also premiered at CES 2024 \u2014 Saloon\u00a0and\u00a0Space-Hub. The Saloon represents the leading concept model within its new EV series, developed from the brand's philosophy of being \"Thin, Light, and Wise.\" The model, which is built on a new EV-only platform, features a low-floor, sporty dynamics, and efficient powertrains. The streamlined and futuristic design of the Saloon features a wedged nose, a flowing roofline, gullwing doors, and a high-set rear.\nThe Space Hub was developed\u00a0under the theme of \u201caugmenting people's daily lives\". The car features a panoramic roof and is designed to complement passengers seated facing each other at the back of the vehicle.\nWhile specific details on the powertrain and battery capacities available for the Honda 0 Series were not released, the company claims that all models will feature e-axles, which integrate the motor, inverter, and gearbox into the car's axle. Honda also claims these cars will support rapid charging, with a 15 to 80 percent charge taking less than 15 minutes.\nEnvisioning a greener automotive industry, Honda also shared its intention to make everything it produces and does carbon-neutral by 2050. The company confidently stated that it aims to sell only EVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) globally by 2040.\n3. Sony's updated Afeela EV\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced the updated Afeela, a concept EV that was originally unveiled last year, by driving it onto the stage using a PS5 controller. A joint venture project with Honda as part of Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), the Afeela is an evolution from Sony's Vision S concept.\nIn addition to its remote control operations, the company also showcased a range of updates to the Afeela concept. Along with offering an array of games, the company's collaboration with Epic Games has now enabled augmented reality (AR) mapping. Utilizing data from the car's myriad sensors, and powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 5, SHM now offers immersive 3D maps of the car's surroundings, enhancing safety for occupants.\nSHM also plans to utilize this technology in gaming and entertainment domains as well, for which it is collaborating with virtual reality player Polyphony Digital. The partnership aims to create an immersive experience within the car.\nIn a strategic move, SHM has entered into an agreement with Microsoft, tapping into the Azure OpenAI Service to create a conversational, personal, customized agent for Afeela. SHM is also unlocking the doors of Afeela's developer space to create a platform for creators and developers to innovate and construct applications and services compatible with the EV.\nSHM has announced that it will start taking preorders for Afeela in 2025, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026. With two behemoths in the technology and automotive space joining hands to innovate, we expect much more to come out of the Afeela project in the coming years.\n2. Snapdragon Digital Chassis\nQualcomm Technologies and Robert Bosch GmbH announced the automotive industry\u2019s first central vehicle computer that is capable of hosting both infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities on a single system-on-chip (SoC).\nThe advancement will enable a central system to handle tasks related to safety and security requirements, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving requirements.\nThe cockpit and ADAS integration platform utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an advanced and adaptable solution designed to support mixed-criticality workloads and offer high-performance capabilities. \"With this cost-effective solution, we are paving the way for bringing even more ADAS functions into vehicles, including in the entry-level and mid-range segment,\" said Christoph Hartung, president of the Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division at Bosch, in a statement.\nmetamorworks/iStock\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chasis is already offering a suite of functionalities starting with the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform that provides seamless and secure connectivity, cloud services, and over-the-air updates for vehicles. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform provides immersive experiences with features like high-resolution displays, 3D audio, voice, and gesture recognition, and augmented reality for both drivers and passengers.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon Ride Platform utilizes AI and computer vision to drive advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving features, including lanekeeping, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance. Lastly, the Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud ensures secure and scalable cloud connectivity, data management, and analytics tailored for vehicles.\n1. World's first digital cockpit\nStellantis, BlackBerry QNX, and AWS have teamed up to unveil\u00a0a first-of-its-kind virtual cockpit for automobiles at this year's CES.\nPart of the group's Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW), the platform will greatly accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge car technology to customers. The key to this acceleration lies in the utilization of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which functions as a virtual lab for developing car controls and systems.\nThe platform enables the creation of \"realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, but without needing to change the main software that runs them, taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases,\u201d according to a statement from the company.\nThrough the utilization of QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace, Stellantis can now introduce an advanced simulation of a virtual cockpit into a cloud-based environment. The collaboration between Stellantis and AWS, a prominent cloud services provider, was established in January 2022.\nAccording to Stellantis, the virtual cockpit platform is equipped with impressive tools for the virtualization of graphics, audio, and inputs from the touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. \"Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles, leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it. With our virtual cockpit, we're revolutionizing not just our approach, but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry,\" said Yves Bonnefont, Chief Software Officer at Stellantis, in a statement."

(NYSE: JBL), reported preliminary, unaudited financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\u201cAs previously announced, we experienced a broad-based softening in demand during the final stretch of our first quarter, which you can see reflected in our first quarter revenue,\u201d said CEO Kenny Wilson. \u201cDespite softer demand, the team delivered good year-over-year growth in core margins and core earnings per share,\u201d he added.\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights:\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook:\n$7.0 billion to $7.6 billion\n$216 million to $301 million\n$0.77 to $1.37 per diluted share\n$339 million to $399 million\n$1.73 to $2.13 per diluted share\nFiscal Year 2024 Updated Outlook:\n$31 billion\n5.3% - 5.5%\n$9.00+ per diluted share\n$1+ billion\n(Definitions: \u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as U.S. GAAP operating income less amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net and costs from the divestiture of businesses plus other components of net periodic benefit cost. Jabil defines core earnings as core operating income, less loss on debt extinguishment, loss (gain) on securities, other components of net periodic benefit cost, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares as determined under U.S. GAAP. Jabil defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant and equipment). Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil\u2019s core operating income to its U.S. GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its U.S. GAAP net income and U.S. GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)\nForward Looking Statements: This release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and our guidance for future financial performance in our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (including, net revenue, U.S. GAAP operating income, U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share, core operating income (Non-GAAP), core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) results and the components thereof, including but not limited to amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges and restructuring, severance and related charges) and our full year 2024 (including net revenue, core operating margin (Non-GAAP), core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) results, the components thereof and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)). The statements in this release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from our current expectations. Forward-looking statements could be affected by the following factors, among others, related to the sale of the Mobility business to BYD Electronic (International) Company Limited (\u201cBYDE\u201d): the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreement, or the failure to satisfy closing conditions and consummate the potential transaction; the ability of Jabil or BYDE to obtain required regulatory approvals for the potential transaction and the timing and conditions for such approvals, which may be obtained sooner than expected; the ability to obtain any approval required from the stockholders of BYDE; disruption from the potential transaction, including potential adverse changes to relationships with customers, employees, suppliers or other parties resulting from the failure to consummate the potential transaction; potential proceedings relating to the potential transaction that could be instituted against Jabil; unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from the potential transaction, whether or not consummated; the inability to retain key personnel; the impact of changes in economic, market, political or social conditions; and future regulatory or legislative actions that could adversely affect the parties.\u00a0 Other factors that could impact forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; scheduling production, managing growth and capital expenditures and maximizing the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity effectively; managing rapid declines or increases in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; the effect of COVID-19 on our operations, sites, customers and supply chain; our dependence on a limited number of customers; our ability to purchase components efficiently and reliance on a limited number of suppliers for critical components; risks arising from relationships with emerging companies; changes in technology and competition in our industry; our ability to introduce new business models or programs requiring implementation of new competencies; competition; transportation issues; our ability to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise; retaining key personnel; risks associated with international sales and operations, including geopolitical uncertainties; energy price increases or shortages; our ability to achieve expected profitability from acquisitions; risk arising from our restructuring activities; issues involving our information systems, including security issues; regulatory risks (including the expense of complying, or failing to comply, with applicable regulations; risk arising from design or manufacturing defects; risk arising from compliance, or failure to comply, with environmental, health and safety laws or regulations and intellectual property risk); financial risks (including customers or suppliers who become financially troubled; turmoil in financial markets; tax risks; credit rating risks; risks of exposure to debt; currency fluctuations; and asset impairment); changes in financial accounting standards or policies; risk of natural disaster, climate change or other global events; and risks arising from expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations. Additional factors that could cause such differences can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nSupplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial\u00a0measures in this release to facilitate evaluation of Jabil\u2019s core operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude\u00a0certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, do not have standard meanings and\u00a0may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes these \u201ccore\u201d financial\u00a0measures are useful measures that facilitate evaluation of the past and future performance of Jabil\u2019s ongoing operations on a\u00a0comparable basis.\nJabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flows to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, earnings per share and free cash flow from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation.\nThe Company determines an annual normalized tax rate (\u201cnormalized core tax rate\u201d) for the computation of the non-GAAP (core) income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. In estimating the normalized core tax rate annually, the Company utilizes a full-year financial projection of core earnings that considers the mix of earnings across tax jurisdictions, existing tax positions, and other significant tax matters. The Company may adjust the normalized core tax rate during the year for material impacts from new tax legislation or material changes to the Company\u2019s operations.\nDetailed definitions of certain of the core financial measures are included above under \u201cDefinitions\u201d and a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures is included under the heading \u201cSupplemental Data\u201d at the end of this release.\nMeeting and Replay Information: Jabil will hold a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.

We\u2019ve taken those learnings and demonstrated the ability to miniaturize optics and camera modules and introduced them into things such as the automotive environment or even the consumer technology space.\u201d\nOne of the optic technologies on display at CES is a product that Jabil designed and engineered for Epilog Imaging Systems Inc., a San Jose, California-based company. Currently automakers place up to 20 cameras around a car to improve visibility. Epilog has patented an imaging system that fuses multiple sensors into one unit, resulting in \u201can industrial-strength video camera that delivers high-speed HDR, 8K+ panoramic video using a single lens, produced at very low cost,\u201d according to a case study from Jabil.\nMany leading auto manufacturers have shown early interest in the technology, Jabil said. Epilog and Jabil are working on incorporating the technology into other consumer goods. Next-generation video technology could include thin, poster-sized televisions with 16K resolution, and the ability to pinch-zoom 8K videos on any mobile device to see blade-of-grass detail or shoot Hollywood-quality videos on inexpensive cameras, the case study said.\n\u201cWith Jabil\u2019s help, we can get the cost where Epilog\u2019s technology goes beyond cars and into security cameras and consumer devices,\u201d said Scott Nisbet, strategic advisor to Epilog.\u00a0\u201cUltimately, you can basically have an IMAX in your pocket.\u201d\nAdvanced driver assistance systems currently are primarily designed and manufactured \u201cin-house,\u201d by automakers, according to a survey Jabil released on automotive technology trends. But less than half of those doing design in-house plan to keep it in-house, and four out of five are considering outsourcing manufacturing within five years, the survey found.\nYour email address will not be published.

During our week scouring the massive consumer tech expo, we saw the latest advancements in automobile audio, e-bikes and even personal planes that don\u2019t require an FAA pilot license.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' New Valentine's Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nWhile we didn\u2019t get the opportunity to get behind the wheels or handlebars, we were able to see the sleek designs up close and get to know the tech under the hoods (or frames). Ahead, check out the vehicles and travel gear we were most excited to hit the market (perhaps we\u2019ll all see them on the small and big screens soon?), including a fully off-the-grid electric trailer that can hitch itself.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nBest Products of CES 2024: Auto, Vehicles and Travel Accessories\nUrtopia Fusion E-Bike\nDesign legend Hartmut Esslinger (known for his work at Apple and Sony) is behind Urtopia\u2019s sleek, futuristic Fusion. Touted as the world\u2019s first dual-motor, dual-battery e-bike, this carbon fiber electric bicycle boasts an onboard AI assistant.The frame is made of top-of-the-line carbon fiber, and riders can go up to 15mph with a range of up to 124 miles with the battery extender (or a 75-mile range without). It features dual-drive 500w front and rear motors, dual drive and throttle modes, a Shimano CUES derailleur, all-terrain tires and an air suspension fork \u2014 all so you can ride through the city, suburbs or trails.Riders can ask the e-bike\u2019s ChatGPT (through the built-in speaker) for route information and more. The Fusion comes with Urtopia\u2019s standard bike features such as phone-free navigation and GPS, Bluetooth, a biometric lock and a movement alarm. An upgraded version, the Fusion CVT, offers premium features such as an Enviolo stepless shifter.The bike can sync with Urtopia\u2019s soon-to-launch smart ring that tracks wearers\u2019 fitness and health; both will be available starting in July.\nBougeRV 12-V Colorful Refrigerators\nAt CES 2024, BougeRV added a stylish splash to its electric cooler lineup with new spring-ready hues of its 12-volt mini fridges. Available in purple, pink and mint, the 23-quart refrigerators power up within 16 minutes, offering freezing (with no ice needed) or cooling from -7 degrees to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It holds up to 32 soda cans and doubles as a charger for your tech gear.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District is an electric eMoto that\u2019s part e-bike, e-moped and e-motorcycle all in one stylish and powerful design. It\u2019s made with a waterproof and backlit LCD display for gauge readouts, while it has a total range between 40 to 120 miles with a top speed of 70 mph. The bike\u2019s battery is swappable too, which means you can use one while the other is charging.The Land District weighs up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick, while it comes in two styles \u2014 The Scrambler for off-roading and The Street for city use. Both models start at $6,995.\nPebble Flow All-Electric Smart RV\nFrom the effortless self-attaching \u201cmagic hitch\u201d\nand the 270-degree panoramic views inside, to the aerodynamic design and EV battery that lets travelers stay off the grid for up to seven days, there are many things to love about the Pebble\u2019s all-electric Flow RV. Per the company, it\u2019s equipped with the world\u2019s first dual-motor active propulsion assist system, which automatically maximizes the vehicle\u2019s range by making it more aerodynamic and easier and safer to tow. It sleeps up to four and powers all of its appliances (a full-sized fridge, a removable induction cooktop and a four-in-one convection microwave), while rooftop solar panels allow the vehicle to self-charge under direct sunlight. The vehicle can be charged at home or at public charging stations and campgrounds, and digital nomads will love the Starlink compatibility.The Flow measures 25 feet long by 7\u20196\u2033 wide by 8\u20198\u2033 tall, and weighs 6,200 pounds when fully loaded. Packages range from $109,000 for the standard configuration to $125,000 with the Magic Pack.\nMercedes-AMG MBUX Sound Drive\nThe Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an electric luxury vehicle that features an impressive infotainment sound system that enhances songs for an \u201cinteractive musical experience.\u201d Brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am from hip hop group Black Eyed Peas, MBUX Sound Drive gives the driver the power to \u201cre-imagine\u201d music based on the car\u2019s acceleration and movement. For example: If the car is at a stop light, elements like vocals begin to get softer in the background and the bass increases in volume, while they\u2019re brought back up when the car accelerates down the street. Drums may kick in when the car hits a certain speed, another musical element could come in when the car makes a left turn, or a right turn could make another element like keyboards drive the song forward. This transforms the music in real-time into a new immersive experience for the driver and everyone in the car.During a brief test drive in Las Vegas, we saw how MBUX Sound Drive uses software and sensors to manipulate music into something new and different. It brings up elements and details in a song that might go unnoticed otherwise. It\u2019s a unique driving experience that really has to be experienced.Right now, MBUX Sound Drive is expected to be released this summer with an over-the-air update for select 2024 Mercedes-AMG models.\nPivotal Helix Single-Seat Personal Aerial Vehicle\nThe future has landed: flying cars have arrived (kind of) in the form of Pivotal\u2019s Helix. One of the most intriguing things about the company\u2019s single-seat personal aerial vehicle? You don\u2019t need an FAA pilot license to get behind the wheel, however, the company notes that \u201crigorous simulator and flight training sessions are required for pilot qualification\u201d at its customer center in Palo Alto, Calif. Starting at $190,000, the 348-pound light eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) can soar up to 5,000 feet above sea level in class G airspace (the only noncontrolled portion of airspace in the U.S.), allowing pilots to travel about 20 miles, or for about two hours at just over 60 miles per hour. Classified as FAA part 103 (ultralight vehicle), Helix is constructed with carbon fiber composite and disassembles into three pieces to fit into a 16-ft. storage trailer, and the amphibious hull allows the vehicle to float in water for emergency landings. (The company says that the aircraft can go from storage to flight in 30 minutes.) Inside, there\u2019s a digital flight panel with navigation not unlike your average land vehicle, but with joystick and fly-by-wire controls, all designed and built for safety by a team that includes U.S. astronaut Ed Lu, Google alum Alan Eustace and venture capitalist/flight instructor Cyrus Sigari, among others.Pilots need to weigh 220 pounds and under and have a standing height under 6\u20195\u2033. Per Pivotal, shipping for the personal plane begins June 10.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nKendra Wilkinson Reflects on Her Time as Playmate After Depression Diagnosis: \u201cPlayboy Really Messed Up My Whole Life\u201d\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims\u2019 New Valentine\u2019s Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here\u2019s When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nSee the Cover of the Next \u2018Percy Jackson\u2019 Novel\n(Exclusive)\nGreen Carpet Fashion Awards Set L.A.

        "raw_content": "Supply Chain 24/7\nTransportation\nWarehouse/DC\nSupply Chain\nTechnology\nBusiness\nResources\nServices\nSocial Media\nJabil: Automating supply chain decision-making\nThis contract manufacturer gains real-time visibility and actionable insights over its massive global supply chain through the development of a dynamic, mobile platform\u2014 and earns a top spot in Gartner\u2019s annual supply chain innovation awards.\nMuch like today\u2019s automobile manufacturers are focused on taking individuals out of the driver\u2019s seat and giving them a lesser role in turn-by-turn vehicle operations, Jabil Circuit has spent the last four years honing a highly automated, digital supply chain that requires much less hands-on attention.\n\u201cWe want to reduce the amount of time that we, as supply chain managers, spend in the driver\u2019s seat by automating a lot of the activities we handled in the past,\u201d says Fred Hartung, vice president of supply chain and global logistics for Jabil.\nAs an electronic product solutions company that provides comprehensive electronics design, production, and product management services to global electronics and technology companies, Jabil Circuit works with customers in a wide range of industries. To do this, the company relies on a massive global supply chain that includes 17,000 suppliers, 700,000 part numbers and 101 manufacturing plants in 24 countries.\n\u201cOur supply chain is more complex than most because we manufacturer other companies\u2019 products,\u201d says Hartung. \u201cAs a result, we have to operate very individualized supply chains across 250 premier customers.\u201d That means Jabil Circuit can\u2019t just approach one customer and ask it to consolidate parts with a competitor or with a company in a completely different industry\u2014even if that company is using the same parts as the first customer.\nAdding to the complexity is the sheer volume of parts that Jabil Circuit manages on a daily basis for its customers. \u201cIt\u2019s an environment that was really crying out for optimization, automation and the ability to capture all of the information from the supply chain environment,\u201d Hartung explains. \u201cThen, we needed to be able to orchestrate and use that information across all of our partners and customers.\u201d\nOver the next few pages we\u2019ll learn how Jabil Circuit was able to achieve this goal, find out what technology platforms are driving this initiative, and learn the key benefits the global company is already seeing from these mobile efforts.\nCreating a fluid supply chain\nFour-and-a-half years ago, the logistics and supply team at Jabil Circuit started thinking about how it could make its global supply chain more efficient while also simplifying operations and ensuring that products and information flowed as seamlessly as possible as they moved from supplier to manufacturer to distributor to end user.\nThe team also wanted to better leverage the company\u2019s structured and unstructured data (e.g., blogs and social media posts) and that of its customers and business partners. Finally, it wanted to be able to turn those insights into actionable data that would be useful for decision-making.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just want visibility, we wanted actionable visibility,\u201d says Hartung. \u201cWe wanted to know what actions to drive, what to move forward with, and what actions could be automated.\u201d\nRealizing that Excel spreadsheets weren\u2019t going to cut it\u2014and that its existing technology platforms probably weren\u2019t up to the task either\u2014the contract manufacturer set out to build a new platform that would be known as \u201cJabil InControl\u201d (Intelligent Control) from the ground up. Hartung says that the timing was right because data storage was becoming less expensive and more available Big Data was having a large impact on supply chains. And at the same time, analytics applications were growing in popularity.\n\u201cThere was a confluence of technology, so everything just kind of came together at once,\u201d says Hartung. \u201cIt was less of an epiphany on our part, and more of a \u2018holy cow, we believe we can really do this.\u2019\u201d And like many projects, this one started out small and slowly became a major initiative. \u201cOnce we started working on it, the process just fed itself,\u201d he says.\nHarnessing the globe\nTo develop its new supply chain visibility platform, Jabil Circuit tapped the collective knowledge of its managers and employees, talked to them about their jobs, asked them about potential productivity improvements, and explored the various functional areas that contribute to the contract manufacturer\u2019s overall supply chain.\nEarly on, Hartung says that the company was less interested in the typical 3% to 5% improvements and more focused on attaining 20% to 30% jumps by introducing new technologies, examining cost points and leveraging its internal knowledge bases\u2014versus just turning the project over to its IT department.\n\u201cWe used the \u2018incubation method\u2019 to come up with ideas and test them out,\u201d Hartung recalls. \u201cIf the idea didn\u2019t work out, we threw it away and moved on to the next thing.\u201d\nWithin three months, the company had a functioning product that was already proving its worth across five key areas: growing revenue, helping profitability, increasing free cash flow, decreasing working capital, and increasing service levels. Because four of the five measures can be directly attributed to financial statements, Hartung and his team were able to begin building support for the initiative.\nInitially known as a demand driven supply chain (DDSC), the platform enabled advanced planning and helped Jabil Circuit identify changes in demand and then adjust accordingly. \u201cThat\u2019s the first piece that we automated,\u201d says Hartung.\nUsing a process called actionable proactive analytics (AMP), the company was able to more efficiently utilize and allocate inventory and improve its customer service levels by 20%. \u201cWe occupy a low-margin, extremely capital-intensive segment of the market,\u201d says Hartung, \u201cwhere the traditional approach was just to load up on inventory.\u201d\nCustomers were also enamored by the initiative, Hartung says, and started providing the kind of positive feedback needed to move the project out of the testing stages and into Jabil Circuit\u2019s supply chain. From there, he says the company\u2019s supply chain department partnered with its IT department to lay out the road map for getting that done. As part of that initiative, the platform would incorporate mobile capabilities and be made available to customers and business partners.\n\u201cAfter about two years of getting nothing but positive feedback from the business community\u2014and helping to grow both revenue and profitability,\u201d says Hartung, \u201cwe decided to invest millions to build the second version on a commercial platform that had multi-tenancy capabilities.\u201d\nMeasuring the benefits\nCurrently, version 1.0 of Jabil InControl is a Web application, while development for version 2.0 is being created as a hybrid app. Using the multifaceted supply chain platform, the company has been able to reduce its inventory costs by more than $300 million, or 13%, since the platform was rolled out. The company has also elevated its customer service levels by 20%.\nJabil Circuit\u2019s customers, which include some of the world\u2019s largest brands and high-tech manufacturers, have gained from the platform\u2019s collaborative decision-making capabilities and the way in which it proactively protects against supply chain disruption. According to Hartung, the platform also lets customers optimize Jabil\u2019s significant manufacturing and distribution footprint to minimize their own total landed product costs.\nHartung says the contract manufacturer has also lowered its supply chain risk over the last few years. \u201cWhen you have access to Big Data and analytics, everything becomes that much more manageable,\u201d he notes. \u201cThings that couldn\u2019t be done before\u2014such as assessing supply chain risk\u2014can be done now thanks to the technology.\u201d\nFollowing the 2015 explosions at the container storage station at the Port of Tianjin in China, for example, Jabil quickly identified which of its 17,000 suppliers were situated within a 150-mile radius of the plants. With that data in hand, Jabil\u2019s logistics and supply chain organization knew the parts that each was producing or supplying, how much inventory each supplier had on hand, as well as the alternative sources for those parts. Using its supply chain visibility platform, the company could also view in-transit inventory and the potential impact of any supply disruption.\n\u201cWe had all of this information within minutes and immediately started working on alternative sourcing strategies,\u201d says Hartung, \u201cwhereas with most companies, it takes about three to four weeks to fully understand that picture.\u201d\nFocus on process improvement\nHaving a centralized database for the 700,000 components that it carries not only provides Jabil with inventory visibility, but it also allows the company to build analytics around and understand the risk profile for \u201cevery single component and across eight or nine risk-related attributes,\u201d says Hartung. \u201cWe can look at everything from defects per million to supplier performance to the lifecycle age of every product. Using this data, our supply chain managers can go out and proactively mitigate problems.\u201d\nJabil InControl isn\u2019t only winning over the company\u2019s internal and external customers, it\u2019s also getting attention in the supply chain space. In fact, it recently caught the attention of research giant Gartner, which named the company a \u201csupply chainnovator\u201d as part of its annual supply chain innovation awards for 2016.\nAccording to Gartner, Jabil Circuit earned the award in the high-tech manufacturing category for driving the transformation of its global digital supply chain through the use of unconventional, innovative and high-impact approaches.\n\u201cJabil\u2019s InControl provides the supply chain ecosystem and its customers worldwide with unique and holistic views of the complex material flow from raw material manufacturers to the delivery of end products,\u201d said Virginia Howard, research director of Gartner supply chain research. \u201cAs an early adopter of innovative supply chain visibility tools and intelligent analytics, Jabil is making major strides in optimizing its working capital while automating supply chain decision-making.\u201d\nGoing forward, Hartung says Jabil Circuit plans to expand its InControl platform to leverage even more functionalities, including machine learning, cognitive analysis, and complex event processing in support of the driverless, piloted supply chain of the future.\n\u201cWe want to take as much of the analysis as possible out of the individual\u2019s hands,\u201d says Hartung, \u201cand free up our managers and employees in a way that allows them to spend 85% to 90% of their time driving improvements.\u201d\nArticle Topics\nAbout the Author\nLatest News & Resources\nFeatured Downloads"

(NYSE: JBL) announced today the closing of the transaction to divest its Mobility business to BYD Electronic (International) Company Limited (\u201cBYDE\u201d) in a cash transaction valued at $2.2 billion. The company previously announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the transaction on September 26, 2023.\n\u201cWe are pleased to successfully close this transformational deal and I am confident that this is the right step forward for Jabil,\u201d said CEO Kenny Wilson. \u201cThe net proceeds will enable us to enhance our shareholder-centric capital framework, including incremental share buybacks. Additionally, it will provide opportunities for further investment in key areas of our business.\u201d\nQ2 Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook\nAs stated, for modeling purposes, the second quarter guidance provided by the Company on December 14, 2023, assumed a January 31, 2024, close date for the mobility divestiture. With the transaction closing earlier, Jabil now anticipates the midpoint of the prior guidance range for net revenue and core earnings per share for the second quarter to be lower by approximately $400 million and $0.30, respectively, which aligns with the expectations the company outlined on its first quarter earnings call.\nPrior Q2 FY24 Outlook\nUpdated Q2 FY24 Outlook\nNet revenue\n$7.0 billion - $7.6 billion\n$6.6 billion - $7.2 billion\nU.S. GAAP operating income (1)\n$216 million - $301 million\n$168 million - $253 million\nU.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share (1)\n$0.77 - $1.37 per diluted share\n$0.47 - $1.07 per diluted share\nCore operating income (non-GAAP) (2)\n$339 million - $399 million\n$291 million - $351 million\nCore diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) (2)\n$1.73 - $2.13 per diluted share\n$1.43 - $1.83 per diluted share\nFiscal Year 2024 Outlook\n\u201cI am delighted to close the transaction and receive the net proceeds ahead of schedule,\u201d said CFO Mike Dastoor. \u201cThe earlier close and receipt of funds will enable us to begin initiating plans to reduce stranded costs and executing a series of accelerated buybacks throughout FY24. As a result, we expect to fully utilize our current $2.5 billion dollar repurchase authorization this fiscal year. These actions give me confidence that we will be able to offset lower income in Q2 and deliver core earnings for FY24 in excess of $9 per diluted share.\u201d\nPrior FY24 Outlook\nUpdated FY24 Outlook\nNet revenue\n$31 billion\n$30.6 billion\nCore operating margin\n5.3% - 5.5%\n5.3% - 5.5%\nCore diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP)\n$9.00+ per diluted share\n$9.00+ per diluted share\nAdjusted free cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$1+ billion\n$1+ billion\n(Definitions: \u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as U.S. GAAP operating income less amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net and costs from the divestiture of businesses plus other components of net periodic benefit cost. Jabil defines core earnings as core operating income, less loss on debt extinguishment, loss (gain) on securities, other components of net periodic benefit cost, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares as determined under U.S. GAAP. Jabil defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant and equipment). Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil\u2019s core operating income to its U.S. GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its U.S. GAAP net income and U.S. GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)\nForward Looking Statements: This release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our guidance for future financial performance in our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (including, net revenue, U.S. GAAP operating income, U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share, core operating income (Non-GAAP), core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) results and the components thereof, including but not limited to amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges and restructuring, severance and related charges) and our full year 2024 (including net revenue, core operating margin (Non-GAAP), core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) results and the components thereof and adjusted free cash flow (non-GAAP)), those related to our financial priorities and the future components of our expected capital structure and allocation, our expectations with respect to stock repurchase activities, including their timing, our plans to reduce costs, and those regarding the expected financial impact of the sale of the Mobility business to BYD Electronic (International) Company Limited (\u201cBYDE\u201d).

        "raw_content": "News Details\nJabil Updates Fiscal 2024 Outlook\nCompany to Present at Upcoming Conference\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nJabil Inc. (NYSE: JBL) today announced it is updating its outlook for fiscal 2024.\n\u201cDuring the final stretch of our first quarter, we experienced softening in demand, as a result of short-term inventory corrections across certain end-markets where we participate,\u201d said CEO Kenny Wilson.\nJabil now expects revenue to be in the range of $8.3 billion - $8.4 billion for the first fiscal quarter, slightly below the low end of its previously announced range, while the outlook for core earnings per share during the quarter is expected to be near the midpoint of the range provided on September 28th, 2023.\nJabil expects this inventory rebalancing to continue into its second fiscal quarter and as a result anticipates revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $7.0 billion - $7.6 billion.\nFor fiscal 2024, revenue is now expected to be approximately $31 billion, down 7 percent from the midpoint of previous guidance, while the company\u2019s outlook for core operating margin is expected to be within the previously provided guidance range of 5.3% - 5.5%, which will result in core earnings per share in excess of $9.00 for fiscal 2024.\n\u201cOver the past several years we have intentionally structured the company to be more reliable throughout a range of economic cycles. As a result, we expect Jabil\u2019s profitability to be more resilient, despite softer demand. This provides yet another proof point of Jabil\u2019s improved ability to navigate an economic downturn. Importantly, we continue to expect to deliver more than $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year and we remain committed to our previously discussed share repurchase strategy,\u201d continued Wilson.\nJabil to Present at Upcoming Conference:\nAs previously announced, Jabil will present at the UBS Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at 4:15 PM MST (6:15 PM EST).\nA live audio webcast and replay of the event will be accessible on the Jabil Investor Relations website at https://investors.jabil.com.\n(Definitions: \u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as U.S. GAAP operating income less amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring, severance and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges and business interruption and impairment charges, net plus other components of net periodic benefit cost. Jabil defines core earnings as core operating income, less loss on debt extinguishment, loss (gain) on securities, other components of net periodic benefit cost, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares as determined under U.S. GAAP. Jabil defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net capital expenditures (acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant and equipment). Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings, core diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings, diluted earnings per share and free cash flow from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations.\nForward Looking Statements: This release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our guidance for future financial performance for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (including revenue and core earnings per share), second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (revenues), full year 2024 (including revenue, core operating margin, core earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow) and our expectations with respect to stock repurchase activities. The statements in this release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from our current expectations.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: The Show\u2019s Growing Influence on Automotive & Mobility\nWhy are we excited about CES this year?\nCES 2024, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 9-12 in Las Vegas.\nCES is a big show. The 2020 show, which ran just prior to the Covid shutdown, hosted 171,000 attendees. Attendance figures dwindled in subsequent years, but 2023 found the show hitting a respectable 115,000.\nThis year, CES expects to host approximately 130,000 attendees and 4,000 exhibitors, which includes more than 300 mobility-related companies.\nUnlike smaller conventions in Las Vegas, CES fills all of the halls at the Las Vegas Convention Center plus overflows across 10 hotels. So, planning ahead is important if you\u2019re going to prioritize the booths you want to visit.\nA big part of CES\u2019s evolution over the past few years has been its evolution into a major\u00a0automotive show. This makes a lot of sense, given how technology is increasingly\u00a0interwoven into the automotive industry.\nAutomakers typically take the opportunity for a sizable presence at CES, but this year shows a more muted footprint by the large car companies. Ford, General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota are not formally participating.\nWhile sad, the lack of some of the larger automakers leaves much more opportunity for the remainder to stand out.\nThe new West Hall is where the big automotive players exhibit.The theme in this hall is \u201cVehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\u201d \u2013 where you\u2019ll see the big vendor displays from Hyundai, Kia, VinFast, John Deere, Caterpillar, Magna and Amazon Automotive.\nHonda intends to debut an all-new global electric-vehicle series and showcase key technologies. The company said it will introduce 30 new EVs by 2030, a number that includes both battery-electric and fuel-cell-powered products.\nSeparately,\u00a0Afeela, the brand created by a Sony-Honda joint venture, will exhibit its latest vehicle prototype.\nThe map of the Convention Center\u2019s West Hall reveals that Hyundai has the largest footprint. The company plans to share developments related to hydrogen fuel cells and software-defined vehicle technology.\nIn addition, Hyundai\u2019s Supernal subsidiary\u00a0will unveil a product concept for its eVTOL aircraft and show its associated vertiport.\nVietnamese automaker\u00a0VinFast, who recently announced they expect to have 125 franchised dealers as part of an initial rollout and then hundreds by the end of 2024 throughout the U.S., will present two vehicles at CES that could be coming to\u00a0U.S. dealerships\u00a0within a couple of years: an electric pickup and the VF 3 microcar that could sell for under $20,000.\nElectric vehicle and charging news made a splash at the 2023 CES tech show. But their presence this year mirrors what's going on in the automotive market \u2014 a bit of an EV growth slowdown. At the 2024 CES, EV announcements are much more subdued than at last year\u2019s show.\nBlink Charging plans to exhibit. Additional major charging companies such as EVgo, ChargePoint and Electrify America say they won't exhibit or break news at the show.\nLooking over the exhibit hall space, Autonomous (self-driving) technology no longer seems to be an auto industry obsession. Problems at\u00a0GM subsidiary Cruise\u00a0highlighted a troublesome 2023 for robo taxis in particular. Ford\u00a0announced last year\u00a0that it would move away from fully autonomous tech. Both Ford and GM took huge losses on automated tech last year. Unlike previous CES expos, few self-driving demonstrations are expected.\nHaving said that, a number of companies will show off how using AI inside vehicles is making them smoother and safer for drivers through better in-vehicle virtual assistants and cabin monitors.\nBeyond the automakers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers use CES to showcase cutting-edge technologies. Expect to see new offerings from companies such as Qualcomm, Mobileye, Bosch, Magna and others.\nI expect that this year, on the back of their announcement with Hyundai, the Amazon Automotive booth will be quite busy.\nThe North Hall hosts a number of smaller vendors in the Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility theme and is worth checking out.\nBut, by no means are the automotive and mobility innovations limited to just these locations. For example, last year, we got a glimpse of the brand-new Honda-Sony JV vehicle named the Afeela in the Central Hall.\nIn recent years, CES has become much more focused on startups. I believe that the earlier-stage companies in the smaller booths at the Venetian Expo make up the best part of the show. The Venetian Expo hosts a number of interesting sections, including the \u201cInnovations Showcase\u201d and \u201cCountry Pavilions.\u201d\nFinally, I will be up on stage twice on Monday this week, both at the Connected2Car Conference. I will kick off the conference with a keynote on the state of vehicle electrification, and then I\u2019ll moderate a panel on the evolution of the dealership sales channel, with panelists Mike Stanton (NADA), Jeremy Beaver (DGDG), Beth Hill (Ford Direct) and Jessica Stafford (Cox Automotive).\nCES is the premier conference for new technologies and has become a major conference for breaking news in the automotive and mobility industries.\nI look forward to seeing you out there!\nGeneral Partner at Automotive Ventures | Author of the book \"The Future of Automotive Retail\" | Author of the weekly \"Intel Report\"\nRelated posts\nWhy We Invested: RockED\n2024 Predictions\nFunding the next wave of innovation in transportation technology\nCopyright \u00a9 Automotive Ventures"
