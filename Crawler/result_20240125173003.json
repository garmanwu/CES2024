Small size and high density dust particles under the influence of gravity, when passing through the HEPA, the speed is reduced, like sediment sinking to the bottom of the river, naturally settling on the HEPA filter.\n3. Ultra-fine particles do Brownian motion to hit the HEPA fibre layer, which is purifed by the influence of van der Waals force.\n1.During falling , rainwater will contact with particles, dust, pollutants, etc. in the atmosphere, which can effectively remove pollutants in\nthe air and make the air fresher and cleaner.\n2.

Negative ions are negatively charged air molecules or molecular groups that can adsorb and neutralise some harmful substances in the air, such as dust, pollen, bacteria, etc. Positive and negatively charged particles, which can release an electric charge, hit the nucleus of viruses and bacteria directly, destroying the nucleic acid chain, and eliminating harmful substances from the root.\n(Plasma Field & UV Sterilisation)\nRestore a large number of positive and negative ions produced by rainy day air lightning.
