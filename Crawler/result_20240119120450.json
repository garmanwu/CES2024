        "raw_content": "Biodegradable ECG Patch Paves the Way to a More Sustainable Medical Industry\nWhat you\u2019ll learn:\nIn 2019 alone, people discarded 53 metric tons of electronic waste. Replacing fossil-based materials with sustainable alternatives is one of the key challenges if we\u2019re to shrink the carbon footprint of electronic equipment. Reducing single-use devices with modular designs consisting of reusable and recyclable\u2014or even biodegradable\u2014parts is critical in reaching that goal.\nWhy would we throw away precious minerals because the whole device can\u2019t be reused? At the same time, these new materials need to have performance comparable to the materials they replace.\nWe set out to develop modular, nanocellulose-based materials to replace a particular segment of this development\u2014adhesive electronic equipment for medical use. For this purpose, the adhesive patch used for electrocardiography (ECG) is the best place to start, because the mission is to recreate a technology that the medical industry has spent decades perfecting for its purpose, into a modular, biodegradable packaging. It\u2019s an example of a technology where hitting that sweet spot between reliability and sustainability is critical for long-term success.\nCardiac disease is the number one cause of death in both the United States and the EU, and the ECG is the easiest and most popular way to monitor cardiovascular health. It\u2019s used to record the heart\u2019s electrical signal to monitor circulatory health and the condition of the heart. Electrodes attached to the skin with an adhesive plastic patch communicate the ECG trace to a receiver, showing the electrical activity in a patient\u2019s heart.\nTraditional ECG Patches\nThese ECG patches are essential to modern medical treatment. That\u2019s because an ECG is easy to conduct, and the required technology is widely available. From an economic perspective, the global ECG patch and Holter monitor market was valued at US$1.2bn in 2022, and it\u2019s expected to grow at an annual rate of 20% from 2023 to 2030.\nTraditional ECG patches combine Ag/AgCl-electrodes with a conductive gel, held together by a plastic film. At least three electrodes need to be placed on the patient\u2019s skin to create an ECG lead vector across the heart, meaning at least three disposable patches are used per patient.\nBy measuring cardiac electrical activity in different areas of the circulatory system, medical professionals can assess the level of functionality in different parts of the heart and recommend treatment if discrepancies are found.\nDealing with Patch Waste\nBecause of the non-modular and non-biodegradable nature of current technology, ECG patches are disposed of as medical waste after every use. Consequently, these patches represent one of the most common sources of medical waste. While this equipment is critical for healthcare services, such single-use technology can\u2019t be the market standard if the medical industry is to become sustainable in the long term.\nMedical waste is a large and growing issue. According to the AMA Journal of Ethics, 8% of U.S. climate gas emissions come from healthcare. In terms of plastic waste, American hospitals generate up to 6 million tons of waste annually.\nBecause medical waste is considered hazardous, almost no single-use equipment can be recycled, meaning it goes straight to disposal, most commonly by incineration. Thus, the production of single-use technology stays high, while used equipment contributes to climate emissions and potential environmental challenges related to waste disposal.\nAlthough every healthcare development helps us stay alive and healthy longer, new and more advanced single-use equipment puts a further burden on the planet. To deal with this serious and increasing problem, we need to incorporate more biodegradable materials and modular builds into this type of medical technology.\nNanocellulose-Based Biodegradable ECG Patch\nThe solution lies in the use of more biodegradable, cellulose-based materials. Using the same nanocellulose film used to produce cellulose e-skin, we created a fully biodegradable ECG patch (see figure).\nUsing this technology leads to zero plastic waste from ECG, and full recyclability of finite mineral components. Operationally, it\u2019s as reliable to use as the traditional patch.\nIn our technology, the skin patch, which is the disposable part, is not only biodegradable and made from sustainable green material, it also benefits from its unique design that removes the need for conventional metallic connectors to the ECG electronics. This is an important feature, enabling the skin patch to remain purely cellulose-based with printed carbon.\nIn other modular devices in the market, the disposable patch consists of mixed materials, such as metal, plastic, epoxy glue, etc. As a result, they become mixed waste after use.\nModular Skin Applications Beyond the ECG Patch\nHaving established that the concept works, its application isn\u2019t limited to ECG patches. Flexible, easy-to-use, modular skins like the one implemented with this ECG patch could be used for several other applications in the future. Having this proof of concept opens doors to new innovations that further build toward a sustainable future for electronic technology.\nWith the EU Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan and other sustainability legislation in the pipeline, manufacturers of electronics will have to start producing sustainable options to the technologies that medical professionals have relied on and perfected for decades.\nThe biodegradable ECG patch has shown to be a reliable alternative to a proven technology, paving the way for other applications of the same technology in other single-use adhesive patches and healthcare measurement technologies.\nDesigning new technical solutions for industries that rely heavily on single-use equipment is a necessity. This application of nanocellulose skin has the potential to provide sustainable alternatives for many of these vital, yet unsustainable pieces of technology.\nContinue Reading\nAre Sustainability Engineering Roles in Demand?\nDesign Resources Boost Embedded Development Projects\nSponsored Recommendations\nRECOM Power\u2019s DC/DC converter is a 60 W medical-grade converter in a 2.3\u201d x 1.5\u201d package\nCable Harnesses for a Single-Source Solution\nRECOM Article Library\nRECOM Power\u2019s switching regulator is designed to offer all the advantages of a switching regulator but with a low cost for production quantities\nComments\nTo join the conversation, and become an exclusive member of Electronic Design, create an account today!\nNew\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for 2024?

With new EU legislation concerning the sustainability of products around the corner, the push for more environmentally friendly electronics intensifies.\nThe EU project Sustronics has kicked off with the aim to lead the European electronics industry towards sustainable materials, design, manufacturing methods, and improved circularity and energy efficiency. The project has a budget of EUR 40 million, with about a fourth coming directly from the EU under KDT JU instrument. Headed by Philips, the Sustronics project will pioneer design, materials and manufacturing of devices that will comply with strict sustainability demands dictated by the goals of the Green Deal and help companies meet the requirements of upcoming EU legislation concerning sustainable products.\nThe 3-year project comprises nine pilots with the aim of redesigning existing devices or creating entirely new ones. VTT will develop sustainable materials and manufacturing processes for electronic products, as well as circularity enablers, namely smart tags as data carriers for digital product passports. In addition to VTT and the Finnish Tampere University, six Finnish companies representing key steps in the value chain of sustainable electronics are participating in Sustronics: Canatu, Movesense, Screentec, Tervakoski, UpCode, and UPM Raflatac. The Finnish partners are co-funded by Business Finland.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, 53 million tonnes of electronic waste was discarded in just 2019. This number is set to increase by 38% in less than ten years. The use of traditional materials for electronics is no longer viable due to their finite nature and the environmental damage caused by excessive e-waste. This calls for new materials and uptake of circular economy for electronics industry.\nEnvironmental and resource realities are also joined by legislative pressure to address sustainability issues with electronics. During early 2024, new legislation \u2013 Ecodesign for Sustainable Products \u2013 concerning sustainability requirements of products will go into effect. As a result, all products sold in the EU will be required to prove their sustainability. The new legislation will impact both the European electronics industry as well as any company coming into the EU market.\n\u201cIn the near future, companies and consumers will need to choose the sustainable route in the manufacturing and consumption of electronics. The fact is that the current mainstream materials used in consumer and enterprise electronics are finite \u2013 we will run out of them. We want to change the foundation of the industry so that sustainable materials and processes become the new normal for electronic products \u2013 without compromising the performance, and circulated products will be a mainstream option for consumers,\u201d says Liisa Hakola, Senior Scientist and Senior Project Manager at VTT.\nThe ambition of Sustronics is to be the leading project that builds an ecosystem showcasing how the electronics industry can address its sustainability challenges. For example, due to rich natural resources, such as cellulose, and scientific expertise of multiple research and development organisations, Europe is a global leader in the field of bio-based materials. With participants representing, e.g., research hubs, material companies, device manufacturers, and electronic recycling, the Sustronics project will further strengthen the strategic autonomy of Europe as a leading, independent technology hub while addressing Green Deal objectives.\nCanatu, a Finnish carbon nanomaterial developer, participates in a single-use diagnostic pilot which seeks to revolutionize home glucose metabolism testing by introducing an environmentally advanced solution.\n\u201cCarbon nanotubes have the potential to enable several cleantech solutions, offering higher performance and reduced carbon footprint. In the Sustronics project, our focus is to create a sustainable biosensor for C-peptide, which is a biomarker, e.g., for an early-stage diabetes diagnosis. Furthermore, the best practices of eco-design from this project could be applied to Canatu\u2019s future product development,\u201d says Ilkka Varjos, CTO at Canatu Oy.\nAs part of Sustronics, VTT participates in pilots aiming to make ECG patches, automotive dashboards and single-use diagnostics more sustainable. A pilot led by Finnish companies Screentec and MoveSense will develop an eco-friendly, wearable heart monitor with potential uses in healthcare and sports, enabling remote monitoring of the heart.\n\u201cScreentec aims to expand its offering by adding more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as paper-based substrates as well as copper and carbon pastes, alongside the current used plastic substrates and silver pastes. The Finnish pilot included in the Sustronics project, and the participating partners will enable the development, testing and validating of these new material combinations and structures. We at Screentec feel it is a priority to improve the environmental sustainability of single-use medical electrodes. Our aim is to present and offer these new greener options to our current and future customers in the next few years,\u201d says Mikko Paakkolanvaara, CTO at Screentec.\nPhilips, leader of the project, is confident in the project\u2019s importance for the future of Europe\u2019s electronics industry.\n\u201cTogether with our partners in Sustronics \u2013 large companies, small-medium enterprises, and research institutes \u2013 key players in Europe, we can demonstrate that, following a sustainability approach, we can increase competitiveness, productivity, resource autonomy and environmental compatibility of the European Electronic Components and Systems (ECS) industry. This supports the renewal of the European ECS industry towards a circular economy, recyclable materials, and resource efficient manufacturing processes,\u201d states Olga Kattan, Program Manager Public Private Partnerships at Philips Drachten.\nEarlier this year, VTT announced the successful development of a sustainable ECG patch.\nPDF\nPrint\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nShare\nShare\nThe item has been withdrawn.

It provides research and innovation services and information for domestic and international customers and partners, both in private and public sectors.[6]\nVTT is part of Finland's innovation system and operates under the mandate of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.[7]\nHistory[edit]\nTechnical Research Institute of Finland (VTL) (1942\u20131972)[edit]\nVTT \u2013 then called the Technical Research Institute of Finland (VTL) \u2013 was founded on 16 January 1942 by President Risto Ryti\u2019s decree. Its mission was to engage in technical research for the benefit of science and society as a whole. Construction started immediately, and the research institute was completed in autumn 1943. The volume of the building was 20,000 cubic metres, and seven of VTT\u2019s first ten laboratories were placed in the building.[8] After the war, VTT expanded rapidly and was particularly occupied with the quality assurance of war compensation products.[8]\nIn 1950, the research institute comprised 15 laboratories. The state bought the land of Otaniemi Manor in 1949, and in 1955 the laboratory of mining technology moved to Otaniemi as the first VTT laboratory.[8]\nIn the 1960s, VTT grew to be the largest research institute in Finland,[9] employing more than 400 people.[10] VTT was an internationally recognised research centre.[9]\nIn the 1970s, the research institute underwent extensive modernisation, such as simplifying the administration and expanding the testing activities to research.[11]\nTechnical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) (1972\u20132009)[edit]\nIn March 1972, the Technical Research Institute of Finland changed its name to Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT, Valtion teknillinen tutkimuskeskus, National Technical Research Centre).[8] VTT received new tasks due to the strong growth and diversification of industrial activities. It also participated in research related to the restructuring of society. The activities focused on technology research and the associated development work.[11]\nIn 1990, VTT had almost 6,000 cubic metres of underground laboratory space in Otaniemi and 15,000 square metres excavated at a depth exceeding 20 metres.[12]\nIn June 2007, the Ministerial Working Group on Administration and Regional Development supported the proposal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to launch the preparatory work for transforming VTT into a state enterprise in early 2009.[13]\nVTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (2010\u20132014)[edit]\nA new name was introduced in 2010: VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.[8] VTT was divided structurally into groups. In addition to the parent company VTT, the new VTT Group consisted of three subsidiaries: VTT Expert Services Ltd, VTT Ventures Ltd and VTT International Ltd.[14] VTT Memsfab Ltd started its operations in 2011.[15]\nIn 2012, VTT had more than 3,000 employees.[10]\nIn January 2014, VTT reformed its organisation and divided its operations into three business areas:[16]\nIn May 2014, the Government proposed that VTT would be made a limited liability company and that Mikes and VTT would be merged. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, VTT operated in a very businesslike manner: it received about 70 per cent of its income from commissions assigned by companies and research funding open to competition.[17]\nVTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd (2015\u2013)[edit]\nIn January 2015, the Centre for Metrology (MIKES) was merged with VTT, and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland became a limited liability company. The company\u2019s field of activity was defined as applied research in technology, taking research results to practical use, and operating as a national metrology institute. As a limited liability company, VTT was able to react more easily to changes in the customers and the environment, and to operate more freely in the financial markets.[6] Bioruukki, a research centre for the bioeconomy and circular economy, was established in Kivenlahti, Espoo. Its aim was to overcome the \u2018valley of death\u2019 associated with the commercialisation of inventions.[18]\nIn January 2018, VTT sold Labtium Ltd and VTT Expert Services Ltd, which provided testing, inspection and certification services, to Eurofins Scientific Group.[19] In May, it was announced that VTT would start coordinating a European consortium of more than 10 million euros to develop commercial applications for high-temperature SOFC fuel cell technology.[20]\nIn 2019, VTT launched its own incubator activities, VTT Launchpad, through which it provided support for research teams in setting up businesses.[21] In December, VTT established a unit focusing on autonomous mobility in Turku, VTT Senseway.[22]\nIn May 2020, VTT announced that it would acquire Finland\u2019s first quantum computer. Its aim was to build a 50-qubit quantum computer.[23] The Finnish IQM Finland Oy, which works with quantum computing, was selected as the supplier of the quantum computer.[24]\nOrganization[edit]\nVTT\u2019s head office is located in Otaniemi, Espoo. The President and CEO is Antti Vasara, DSc (Tech.).[25] In addition to Espoo, VTT has offices in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kajaani, Kuopio, Tampere and Oulu.[1]\nIn 2022, VTT has four subsidiaries:[4]\nVTT also has five key initiatives, which it calls the technologies of exponential hope and growth[26]\nVTT\u2019s activities and impact[edit]\nVTT receives research funding from the state to perform its basic task, but the state-funded research activities are separated from the company\u2019s market-based activities.[17]\nPartners[edit]\nSome of VTT's partners:\nExamples of research results[edit]\nVTT\u2019s spin-offs[edit]\nSpin-off companies have emerged from VTT\u2019s research results, including\nCommercialised VTT innovations[edit]\nVTT\u2019s research results have also generated products.\nRecognition[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"

The aim is to develop materials from renewable resources in order to safeguard a sustainable future. The Academy of Finland has granted a EUR\u00a09.5 million flagship funding for the first four years of the project. An extension funding for the next four-year period will be based on an interim evaluation. The total funding of the project is EUR\u00a024\u00a0million.The CERES innovation ecosystem will create a unique foundation for new bioeconomy innovations in Finland. Plant-based biomaterial is the future plastics and, according to researchers, much beyond. The purpose of this ecosystem is to develop new materials, in particular based on lignocellulose and forest biomass, for industrial-scale production of packaging, textiles and separation systems, as well as semiconductors, composites and solutions for energy storage.\nAccording to VTT's scenario calculations, if used to manufacture high added-value products, Finnish forest and field biomass could double in value by 2050. It is possible to do all this and, at the same time, reach the climate targets set for the country. This scenario work is the first analysis of Finland's potential in the bioeconomy and its transition to a low-carbon economy, which takes account of all industrial and emission sectors.\nThe objective of Finland's national bioeconomy strategy is to create 100,000 new jobs in the country and increase the bioeconomy output by EUR 40 billion by 2025. The research and development work to be performed under CERES will support the delivery of this objective and help companies to make new openings in the international market.\nOn 23 August 2018, VTT President and CEO Antti Vasara and Aalto University President Ilkka Niemel\u00e4 signed a collaboration agreement to establish the CERES ecosystem. In this agreement, both parties emphasise their willingness to create a joint ecosystem in the field of biomaterial research, as well as create ground rules for successful cooperation. The agreement also aims to support the commercial exploitation of project results.\nCERES will function as a virtual knowledge centre. It will develop new methods for biomass processing as well as material solutions based on these, and provide the industry long-term, globally cutting-edge R&D work.\nThis release was first published 23 August 2018 by Aalto University.\nNever miss an update from Science|Business: \u00a0 Newsletter sign-up\nExplore our Network: A unique international forum for public research organisations and companies to connect their external engagement with strategic interests around their R&D system.\nWhy join?\nBecome a member\nReceive our news bulletin each Tuesday & Thursday and news about bridging Europe\u2019s east-west innovation gap twice a month in The Widening.\nSign up for the Bulletin\nSign up for The Widening\nPrivacy \u00a0 | \u00a0 T&Cs \u00a0 | \u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Science Business Publishing Ltd."

The project hopes to significantly expedite their commercialisation.\nOne area where the simulation platform will be used is to assist an RDI ecosystem's development of internal combustion engines utilising green fuels for marine applications. The Zero Emission Marine ecosystem is spearheaded by marine tech company W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4\u00a0and seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from what is one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries.\nAs shipping remains a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, VTT is promoting the transition to carbon-free fuels.\nAside from this, the end products that emerge during the GECFD project can also help with the development of synthetic fuels themselves. Neste, a leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, is involved in an ecosystem tasked with finding new solutions\u00a0in this realm. The company is one of the largest in Finland and was incidentally recently acknowledged for its sustainability efforts.\nGiven that the GECFD platform is created using open-source software, the simulation tools developed in the project will become freely available upon its completion. The 1.1-million-euro project is funded by Business Finland and participated by AGCO Power, Koja and Vahterus.\nSustainable growth ahead\nVTT is actively moving forward in other development areas, having outlined some significant new research investments for the next three years.\n\u201cVTT\u2019s role is to be bold with future-oriented progress,\u201d said the technical research centre's president and CEO, Antti Vasara.\nNeste is a leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.\nAmong the funding activities is a five-million-euro investment in the next development stage of a local district heat reactor\u2019s nuclear energy concept. A new research and piloting platform for plastic and textile recycling is also to receive backing, to boost its quest to reduce carbon emissions, promote circular economy and limit dependence on imported materials.\nThe research centre is also involved in a piloting environment for sustainable fibre products located in the city of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. This hopes to substantially reduce forestry energy and water consumption, and enable product innovations.\nA digital development platform for biosynthetic materials, meanwhile, is also receiving VTT support to aid the utilisation of AI, biotechnology and synthetic biology to develop completely new, superior, smart and responsive materials at a pace almost tenfold of anything previously seen.\nVTT\u2019s Oulu unit has extensively developed wireless wearable technologies.\nVTT has additionally invested in the development of its research facilities in Oulu, home to a piloting environment for photonics-based medical devices. This is to significantly expedite the products\u2019 path to the healthcare market.\nApart from these investments, the centre is actively supporting a national initiative to affirm Finland\u2019s position as one of the most important microelectronics and quantum technology centres in the EU. VTT is thus part of a cluster that includes the City of Espoo, Aalto University and members of the Technology Industries of Finland.\nVTT helps companies to renew themselves and create new conditions for green transition, said CEO Antti Vasara.\nAll of the investment and support activities are scheduled for\u00a02023\u20132025.\n\u201cIn these areas, we see the next possibility to reach industrial scale through which we can bring new business to Finland. Even in hard times, an organisation like VTT should invest in the future,\u201d Vasara underlined.\nAccording to the VTT CEO, many Finnish and international companies have already agreed to become partners on research themes related to the investments.\n\u201cOur goal is to accelerate industry renewal in companies and attract more investments directly to them,\u201d he added.\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nAll the positive headlines about Finnish startups, SMEs and innovations gathered together and delivered to your inbox."
