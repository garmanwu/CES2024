        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"
