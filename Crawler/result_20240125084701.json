        "raw_content": "CES 2024: GE's Latest Smart Lights Will Spruce Up Your Kitchen Cabinets\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form.\nGE Lighting has a slew of new smart products to show off at CES, including an expanded Matter-capable lineup. But the most eye-catching products go in your kitchen: undercabinet and under-counter smart lights.\nUndercabinet and under-counter lights aren't new, of course, but usually, you're limited to motion sensor-activated white lighting. Savant, the parent company behind GE Lighting, is revealing what it calls a \"first in the North America market\" for undercabinet lighting: full-color support.\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights are \"HD+ Full Color\" and come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form. You can hardwire the lights into your home or use a plug if you have one in a convenient spot.\nThe lights are diffused, and Savant claims they are easy to install with captive screws, but this is a DIY product, so be prepared to put in some elbow grease. The lights also work with either the GE Sync app or Savant's app for its custom smart homes. You can also control them with Google Assistant or Alexa, and they're Matter-capable.\nPricing \"starts\" at $59.99, though it wasn't immediately clear if that's the puck pricing or if the edge-lit fixtures will come in multiple sizes. You can purchase Cync Reveal at Lowes, Target, and Amazon later this year.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nSavant also pledged to expand its lineup of Matter-enabled products to 20 in 2024. That includes the Cync Direct Connect Full Color Smart Bulb, Cync Smart Indoor Plug, the Direct Connect Full Color and Reveal line of bulbs and wafers, the Cync Outdoor Smart Plug, and the Cync Smart Thermostat.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

This robot vacuum features an anti-tangle feature that cuts any hair that may be tangled in the brush rollers.\n\"The cutting heads are carefully positioned to do this, carefully tucking away the heads to ensure that your floors and carpets aren't scratched as the robot moves along,\" according to ZDNET's Beth Mauder.\nAside from this feature, the Dreame X30 features 8000Pa of suction power, dual oscillating mop heads, and automatic carpet detection to lift its mop pads up to 10.5mm.

This variant makes the Omni station, where the robot vacuum docks to empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, also function as a charging dock for a new Ecovacs handheld stick vacuum.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\nBest energy management solutions\nEcoFlow stole the home energy spotlight at CES 2024 with the launch of its largest portable battery to date, the Delta Pro Ultra.

        "raw_content": "When it rains, it pours: GE Lighting launches a raft of cost-saving moves\nGE Lighting has begun a flurry of cost-saving maneuvers as it\nshuts down two Ohio plants, sells off its historic Nela Park headquarters\nbuilding where it will remain as a tenant, and eliminates jobs in the U.S., Canada,\nand China \u2014 all a few weeks after quietly naming a new boss.\nThe company told LEDs Magazine that it intends to close\nits Bucyrus and Logan factories, although the decision is not yet final, saying\nit would likely happen by Sept. 30. The locations have been making fluorescent and\nhalogen bulbs; Bucyrus had also made LED lamps until March of last year.\nMeanwhile, GE has agreed to sell the 1 million-ft2,\n138-acre Nela Park to an affiliate of Milwaukee real estate company Phoenix\nInvestors. GE expects to close the deal this month, staying on as one of the\ntenants. The parties did not reveal the price. Phoenix also owns the land and buildings at Bucyrus and Logan.\nReports of the closures, job losses, and property transaction\nfirst circulated in Ohio media outlets this week, and GE has now confirmed them\nfor LEDs.\nThey come as GE Lighting reshapes itself under new owner, Savant\nSystems, as a provider of internet-connected LED lighting to upmarket homes.\nPrivately-held Savant\nacquired GE Lighting from GE in May 2020, renaming it in full as GE\nLighting, a Savant Company and intensifying\nits focus on connectivity.\nBased in Hyannis, MA, Savant is a controls and software company\nthat describes itself as \u201cthe home automation brand of choice for the world\u2019s most luxurious\nhomes, castles, and even yachts.\u201d It sells fancy and connected controls for\nlighting, heating, cooling, home cinema, music, swimming pools, showers, window\nblinds, and other things.\nConventional lighting still makes money\nGE hasn\u2019t yet dropped fluorescent and halogen bulbs from the mix that Savant picked up\nwhen it bought the company, but it is heading in that direction. GE lists hundreds of products on\nits website including bulbs and strips as well as controls and switches but, it\ndoes not bother to include the conventional bulbs, even though they are\navailable.\n\u201cWe sell them today and we will continue to do so until our\ncustomers no longer want them and/or the government tells us we\u2019re no longer allowed to sell them,\u201d\nthe spokesperson told LEDs.\nThe Bucyrus and Logan shutterings relate directly to the steep\ndecline in demand for those goods.\n\u201cLinear fluorescent lamps continue to experience a double-digit\ndecline in demand year over year for the last five years across the lighting\nindustry,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cEnergy-efficient halogen has already been\nregulated off the market by California and Nevada, and proposed [Department of\nEnergy] regulation will soon eliminate its manufacture and sales across the U.S.\u201d\nThe spokesperson noted GE is negotiating with unions at the\nplants. Should the factories close, job losses would total 175 in Bucyrus and\n50 in Logan.\nGE Lighting\u2019s stronger-then-ever emphasis on LEDs fits well with\nSavant\u2019s controls and automation mission, as LEDs are a good match with digital\ncontrols that can alter on/off, brightness, color, and color temperature\nsettings \u2014 all part of the\nIoT zeitgeist driving the\nlighting industry.\nNot only that, but Savant favors LEDs for other reasons as well,\nselling them as standalone units, not always as connected ones.\n\u201cWhy LED?\u201d GE asks on its website, where it answers its own\nquestion. \u201cCompared to CFL, incandescent, and halogen bulbs, LEDs are longer\nlasting, more energy efficient, and reach full brightness instantly.\u201d\nThe\ncompany introduced eleven new LED lamps two months ago at the CES consumer\nelectronics show in Las Vegas. The bulbs are part of GE\u2019s Cync line of smart\nproducts, rebranded from what GE Lighting under GE had called \u201cC by GE.\u201d\nU.S. manufacturing unsupportable\nUp until a year ago, GE had made LED lamps at Bucyrus, but that\nbecame untenable.\n\u201cDue to legislation and components that can only be\nsourced from overseas, nearly 100% of LEDs on the market are not manufactured\nin the U.S.,\u201d a GE Lighting spokesperson told the\nBucyrus Telegraph-Forum in March 2021. \u201cIn 2019, after another\nlighting company exited LED production from the U.S., we undertook the bold and\nchallenging task of trying to bring jobs from China to the U.S. Less than two\nyears ago we began to assemble A19 LED bulbs with a planned target production\ncost that was sustainable in the market. We did everything within our power to\nmake that happen.\"\nIndeed, soon after the May 2020 acquisition, GE indicated to LEDs\nMagazine that it would continue to make LEDs at the Bucyrus plant, which it\ndescribed at the time as \u201cthe only LED manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d\nnoting that it \u201cfeatures high-speed, fully automated processes.\u201d\nThose processes have now wound down.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we suffered the same fate as others before us,\u201d\nthe GE Lighting spokesperson told the Telegraph-Forum last year. \u201cWe\nfactored all potential cost savings ideas into our financial analysis and still\nthe economics of our A19 LED assembly in Bucyrus proved to be unsustainable.\nThe decision to eliminate recently created jobs was not a decision we came to\nquickly or took lightly.\u201d\nAccording to the news report, the 2021 cutback affected 81\nemployees, some of whom found new jobs before the closing. It came despite\nefforts by retail giant Walmart to help keep Bucyrus\u2019 LED line open by spending\nmore on US-made goods, the article stated.\nWith the latest factory wind-down, GE will have moved to an\noutsourced-only production scheme.\n\u201cLike other companies, we do source from Europe and Asia,\u201d the\nspokesperson said. \u201cEvery lighting company manufactures or sources all LED from\noverseas. We do not have any plants overseas.\u201d\nGE Lighting also now has fewer employees overseas in general than\nit did.\n\u201cTo reduce organizational complexity and align it to a company of\nour current size we eliminated certain roles in the U.S., Canada, and China,\u201d\nthe spokesperson told LEDs. He declined to elaborate.\nExecutive promotion\nThe pared-down GE Lighting, a Savant Company is now overseen by\nKathy Sterio, who the company named president in February, promoting her from\nchief marketing officer. She replaces former president and CEO Bill Lacey, who\nleft in early February and is now vice president of finance at Amazon,\naccording to his LinkedIn page. Sterio reports to Savant Systems CEO Bob\nMadonna.\nGE Lighting will continue to call Nela Park its headquarters site\n\u2014 albeit as a tenant rather\nthan as an owner. Nela Park has long been associated with the GE name. General\nElectric Corp. had housed its lighting unit at the Georgian Revival, university-campus\u2013style facility since it was\nbuilt in 1913, after GE had absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association\n(NELA). It has been home to many lighting discoveries and is regarded by some\nas the world\u2019s first industrial research park.\nAnother\nmodern lighting company with a GE legacy and new owners \u2014 GE\nCurrent \u2014 will now move from Nela Park to new facilities in Beachwood, a\nCleveland suburb. Current has been a tenant of GE Lighting at Nela Park.\nNela Park\u2019s owner-to-be, Phoenix Investors, describes its core\nbusiness as \u201cthe revitalization of former manufacturing facilities throughout\nthe United States.\u201d\nLast September, it acquired the Huron Campus in Endicott, NY, the\nbirthplace of IBM but a facility that had outlived its IBM glory days and which\nis home to many different corporate tenants.\nMARK HALPER\u00a0is a contributing editor for\nLEDs Magazine, and an energy, technology, and business journalist ([email\u00a0protected]).\nFor up-to-the-minute LED and SSL updates, why not\u00a0follow us on Twitter?

The \u201ctumbling rivers of the west,\u201d harvest-laden wagons in Iowa \u201c[crying] out for electric trains\u201d and other sights made Edison wonder \u201cabout ways of harnessing electric power for work and light,\u201d Edmund Morris writes in \u201cEdison,\u201d a biography of the inventor and GE founder.\nMorris writes that \u201cwithin 24 hours of returning home, Edison had sketched something he labeled \u2018Electric Light,\u2019 although it looked more like battery-operated thumbscrew.\u201d In little more than a year, Edison perfected that thumbscrew and started work on the first practical light bulbs that could illuminate homes and streets. Those lights connected to other Edison innovations \u2014 a power grid that drew electricity from generators inside a central power station \u2014 which together changed the world. They found a home at GE, which Edison co-founded in 1892.\nOn May 26, GE announced its agreement to sell its lighting business to Savant Systems Inc., combining the business unit with a company writing the next chapter in lighting innovation. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\u201cToday\u2019s transaction is another important step in the transformation of GE into a more focused industrial company,\u201d says H. Lawrence Culp Jr., GE chairman and CEO. \u201cOur Lighting colleagues will join a fast-growing leader in home automation that shares their passion for bringing the future to light.\u201d\nCulp says the proposed transaction will allow GE Lighting to \u201ccontinue its legacy of innovation, while we at GE will continue to advance the infrastructure technologies that are core to our company and draw on the roots of our founder, Thomas Edison.\u201d\nGE founder Thomas Edison not only built the first practical light bulb, but also the dynamos to generate electricity and the power grid to distribute it.

Top image credit:\u00a0GE Lighting.\nSavant Systems, based in Hyannis, Massachusetts, was founded in 2005 by the engineer, entrepreneur and investor Robert P. Madonna. With both software and hardware, the company has quickly grown to become a market leader with technologies and innovations that are defining the future of lighting and smart homes. Its products include intelligent lighting, smart security and climate systems, whole-house entertainment and other solutions. \u201cSavant\u2019s mission from the start has been to create the number one smart home brand in the world, and I am confident that the acquisition of GE Lighting\u2019s long history of industry leadership continues, while bringing exceptional value and reliability to retail partners and consumers as the number one intelligent lighting company worldwide.\u201d\nSome of GE Lighting's history has been captured by no lesser lights than Norman Rockwell and Maxfield Parrish, who painted posters promoting GE\u2019s popular Mazda lamps. Image credit: GE Reports.\nThrough the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2020, Savant gains long-term license to a storied brand as well as lighting expertise and access to the retail smart home market. Light bulbs and power plants have been part of the GE story since 1882, when Edison turned on the first power grid in New York City, electrifying a section of lower Manhattan. Some of that history has been captured by no lesser lights than Norman Rockwell and Maxfield Parrish, who painted posters promoting GE\u2019s popular Mazda lamps. In 1935, GE lights made history by illuminating the first Major League Baseball night game in Cincinnati. In 1962, GE Research engineer Nick Holonyak Jr. invented the first practical light-emitting diode (LED) in GE labs, a breakthrough that has changed the lighting industry. In recent years, the company partnered with Google to build a connected light bulb that responds to voice commands.\nIn the early 1960s, building on breakthroughs in laser technology made by GE Research engineer Robert Hall,\u00a0Nick Holonyak Jr. invented the first practical light-emitting diode (LED). Image credit: GE Reports.\nInnovation has also marched on in the power generation sectors, as machines that generate and distribute electricity remain a key piece of GE\u2019s industrial core. Engineers have evolved Edison\u2019s early dynamos into turbines that power the world\u2019s most efficient power plants. Even Edison\u2019s direct current grid is making a powerful comeback as a more efficient way to transfer electricity across long distances and from remote sources, like offshore wind farms. This technology, called high-voltage direct current, or HVDC, is now part of GE Renewable Energy.\nEdison\u2019s ingenuity still continues to shine through the ages. In 2012, employees at\u00a0GE Lighting\u2019s NELA Park headquarters in East Cleveland, Ohio, opened a 100-year-old time capsule that included five light bulbs. Engineers cleaned one of the bulbs, screwed it into a socket, and powered it up to 60 volts. It emitted a soft glow, an incandescent echo of an era that gave birth to technology that still keeps evolving.\nIn 1935, GE lights made history by illuminating the first Major League Baseball night game in Cincinnati.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 From electric cars to transparent TVs to the latest accessibility tech and virtual assistants backed by artificial intelligence, there was a wide range of innovations on display at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. The best of it aimed to solve big real-world problems. Some of it aimed to make your life more fun. And some of it was just a little out there.\nAssociated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.\nHere\u2019s what caught our eye at CES 2024.\nACCESSIBILITY PRODUCTS WERE BIG ON HOPE\nAt a conference where excess and opulence manifested itself in nearly everything, it was encouraging to see how much progress has been made toward developing assistive technologies for the disabled.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help Parkinson\u2019s patients and those with hand tremors regain control of their lives. Dutch startup Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI to give people with vocal impairments a chance to have real-time conversations in their own natural voices. OrCam introduced a host of devices designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. And Sony reserved some prime space in its booth to showcase its Access controller for PlayStation.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEARLY EVERYTHING\nUsing software and AI to achieve inter-device connections between smart devices, your home and even your car was central to many of the biggest tech companies at CES 2024.\nSamsung\u2019s new \u201cAI for all\u201d mantra meant integrating its smart home devices and appliances to perform tasks in unison \u2014 like the act of recipe selection automatically pre-heating your oven. The South Korean tech giant also announced a collaboration with Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services for all Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Google is expanding Chromecast to more apps and devices. And Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard to create more inter-operability between smart devices.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize interactions between drivers and their cars.\nVEHICLES ADVANCES WERE ON FULL DISPLAY\nCES 2024 was brimming with new electric vehicles, remote construction vehicles, hydrogen engines and other mobility advances.\nHonda premiered two concept cars, dubbed the \u201cSaloon\u201d and \u201cSpace-Hub,\u201d for a new global EV series. Kia decided to go modular with a trio of electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to change their functionality. And Vietnam-based electric upstart VinFast unveiled an electric truck concept.\nBosch Mobility and Hyundai both doubled down on hydrogen as an energy solution. And Hyundai showcased its AI-based autonomous construction excavator.\nHOPE YOU\u2019RE HUNGRY\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u2019t need to cook \u2014 or mix drinks \u2014 for themselves anymore.\nGE wants you to start smoke food indoors, while generative AI is powering a Brisk smart grill that aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but ColdSnap\u2019s new ice cream machine prepares your frozen treat in two minutes. And Bartesian\u2019s cocktail-mixing appliance can make as many as 60 different kinds of drinks for you.\nMeanwhile, for much younger consumers (and their parents), Veba Baby\u2019s smart baby bottle monitor tracks the expiration of breast milk and formula. The product \u2014 which also serves as a bottle locator \u2014 monitors the temperature, when a baby feeds from the bottle, and more to detect freshness. And everything is logged onto an accompanying app.\nWHAT\u2019S NEW ON TV?\nOLED, Micro LED, 8k ... what does it all mean? It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.
