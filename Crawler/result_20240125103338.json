        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "content": "20 best gadgets of CES 2024: the top TVs, smart home tech, laptops and more we saw at the show\nFrom mind-blowing portable speakers to the return of the phone keyboard, here are our CES 2024 award winners\nWe're deep into CES 2024 now, and the TechRadar team has been prowling the halls looking for all the very best consumer tech at the show, and trying out as much of it as we can until security gets hardcore with us about the show closing for the day.\n The fun this can add to your smart lighting setup can't be underestimated\nBest small appliance: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nWhile the robot vacuum and mop part of this product itself isn't brand new at CES, having released late last year, this new edition of the Deebot X2 is pretty special and novel; it features a connected handheld vacuum (or one with a handle), which also auto-empties itself into the same vacuum bag as the robot vacuum when you dock it. Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. Best gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\n",

Here\u2019s how it works.\n20 best gadgets of CES 2024: the top TVs, smart home tech, laptops and more we saw at the show\nFrom mind-blowing portable speakers to the return of the phone keyboard, here are our CES 2024 award winners\nWe're deep into CES 2024 now, and the TechRadar team has been prowling the halls looking for all the very best consumer tech at the show, and trying out as much of it as we can until security gets hardcore with us about the show closing for the day.\nOnce we'd seen as much as we could, we got everyone together to discuss the absolute best gadgets of CES 2024, ranging from new products that are being released imminently, to fantastic (but very real) prototypes that show a vision of the future that gets us excited about tech all over again.\nObviously, there being only 20 winners here means there are literally thousands of interesting and smart ideas at the show we didn't have space to include. We saw a ton of stuff we thought was seriously great, so be sure to read all our CES news for that \u2013 but these are the products that had the extra juice that got our team talking, and stood out as our Best of CES 2024 winners.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nOur TV of the show simply had to be the first set to make a transparent screen into something practical that you can actually imagine owning. Do we think this will deliver the best picture quality of any TV at CES? No, but that\u2019s not remotely the point. It pushes the art of the TV set to a new level, combining developments from LG\u2019s ground-breaking rollable TV with its unique wireless 4K HDR 120Hz streaming tech and, of course, a clear 4K OLED panel \u2013 all built into a piece of furniture that makes it a real lifestyle object.\nIt can show partially transparent video, or you can watch it like a normal TV with the full contrast you expect from OLED thanks to a contrast-boosting layer that automatically rises out of the base \u2013 plus there's powerful built-in sound, and no cable clutter thanks to the cutting-edge wireless connection box. It all adds up into something unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before in the best TVs.\nBest projector: Samsung The Premiere 8K\nSamsung\u2019s flagship projector for 2024, The Premiere 8K, is the world\u2019s first to support wireless 8K streaming, something it does using an included One Connect box with Wi-Fi 7 support (picture on the right in the image above). It can beam a 150-inch 8K image when positioned just 12 inches away from a screen, and its brightness is specified at an impressive 4,000 lumens, putting it in good company among the best projectors.\nThe Premiere 8K is also an all-in-one solution for home theater audio and gaming. It has a built-in 8.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system powered by 100 watts, and uses Sound-on-Screen tech to elevate audio from the projector up to the screen area for a more cinematic presentation. Like other Samsung projectors, it features the same smart TV interface found in the company\u2019s TVs for streaming, along with Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming. It's high-end tech in a very lifestyle-friendly package and design, and we're excited to see more of it.\nBest soundbar: Samsung HW-Q990D\nThe HW-Q990D is the successor to Samsung\u2019s HW-Q990C, which was already the best soundbar for anyone who wants easy but truly powerful and engrossing Dolby Atmos sound. With 22 speaker drivers and 11.1.4 channels, it\u2019s a go-to option for complete Dolby Atmos immersion, and this year Samsung has added 4K 120Hz pass-through to its HDMI ports, fixing the only minor flaw that we found with its predecessor.\nWhen paired with a compatible Samsung TV, the Q990C can receive Dolby Atmos signals wirelessly. It also supports Samsung\u2019s new Active Voice Pro feature, which uses AI to dynamically highlight voices in a movie\u2019s audio mix and elevate them for those movies where you struggle to hear what's going on. Which will be especially welcome when the soundtrack is as powerful and hard-hitting as this soundbar is capable of being, from our time with it on the show floor.\nBest speaker: Brane X\nSometimes at CES, you know the instant you try a product that you\u2019re seeing something that changes your expectations for a type of product. The Brane X is that for the best wireless speakers. It\u2019s a portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker that has a real, bona fide subwoofer in there. Not a bass port, not a woofer \u2013 a subwoofer that\u2019s the equivalent of an eight-inch sub like you'd find in a soundbar\u2019s separate subwoofer unit. You can see the air vents for it on the right side of the picture above \u2013 it covers the whole bottom of the unit.\nThe difference is absolutely astounding; powerful bass in music that you can feel in your diaphragm for tracks that load up on it, or just a much fuller and richer sound to acoustic instruments that covers a broader, and so more realistic, audio range \u2013 all from something the size of a six-pack. It uses a unique subwoofer design to make this happen, and combined with four other drivers, you get the best, most fulsome sound I\u2019ve heard from any speaker that isn\u2019t a floorstander. It\u2019s launching imminently in the US for $599, and music fans with limited space absolutely must take notice. Not that you\u2019d be able to avoid noticing one if it were playing in front of you.\nBest headphones: Sennheiser Momentum 4 True Wireless\nSennheiser has jumped on the latest generations of Bluetooth tech with its latest wireless earbuds, adding Qualcomm's new chip with Snapdragon Sound for CD-quality audio if you have a compatible phone, but they're also ready for the future of regular Bluetooth with support for Bluetooth 5.4 and LE Audio and Auracast.\nMost importantly, as you'd expect from Sennheiser, we've found they deliver superb audio quality and strong adaptive noise cancellation from what we could tell in our time with them, and still with a long battery life of 7.5 hours in the buds (though we couldn't test that yet). Sennheiser says they're also very low-latency, so will be a step up for gamers.\nWe like the design too, with a shiny finish that nods at jewelry, and a fabric case that follows Sennheiser's other designs. It seems clear that we have a big contender for our list of the best wireless earbuds here.\nBest music player: Fiio R9\nThis all-in-one music system for the streaming world is the ultimate hub however you like to listen, and a great-looking object to have in your home to boot. Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. But in a nice touch, if you don\u2019t want to sign up to Google, Fiio has added its own app store with major music services on board, no login required.\nThe box can handle basically any kind of digital file you could want to throw at it, from PCM 768kHz/32-Bit to DSD512 to MQA, and it even has two kinds of HDMI connection (ARC and straight audio, for SACD/DVD-Audio fans) and it sounds absolutely fantastic. We listened with Fiio\u2019s new FT5 planar magnetic headphones, and there\u2019s so much power and poise and dynamic range, all in a sleek metal design with light-up dials. For those who want the feeling of a huge music system and library in a compact space, this is irresistible.\nBest laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE\nLenovo has been experimenting with E-Ink laptop covers for a few years now, and the Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE concept laptop seems like the natural evolution of its work to date. Even more though, it feels like we can finally see the point of having an E-Ink cover at all.\nThe E-Ink Prism technology built into the lid of the laptop enables you to create a color design on your laptop lid that isn\u2019t just a picture, but can feature animation that brings unparalleled personalization to your device in a way a simple sticker or case on the best laptops never could.\nIt\u2019s not as simple as uploading a PNG, however. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. For the rest of us, we can still absolutely make the device our own \u2013 Lenovo's breathed new life into laptop design with this version of the tech.\nBest computing component: AMD Ryzen 8040 Series\nThe Ryzen 8040-series CPUs that AMD announced at CES 2024 are more than just Team Red\u2019s answer to Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake mobile processors, if AMD\u2019s published benchmarks are right, it might be the AI chip to have in the best laptops next year, such as the new Razer Blade 14 pictured above, which includes the new platform.\nAccording to AMD, the new Ryzen 8040 series processors aren\u2019t just competitive with Intel\u2019s newest mobile silicon, they outpace them across a wide array of workloads from gaming to the latest generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.\nOf course, AMD is going to cherry pick its best results if it can, but if its numbers are accurate, these mobile processors can go a long way to eating into Intel\u2019s absolutely dominant position in the mobile laptop market, and give people a real reason to switch over from Team Blue.\nBest gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\nMSI has a long pedigree for gaming hardware, and its new device is a stunning handheld in its own right. The 1080p display is incredibly crisp thanks to its wide color coverage and speedy refresh rate, while the 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and up to 1TB NVMe SSD storage will help make managing your game library on the go a lot less painful. We were impressed with the whole device in our MSI Claw hands-on, and we can't wait to get deeper into using it.\nBest computing accessory: Razer Project Esther\nRazer Project Esther is the iconic peripherals brand\u2019s latest take on a fairly old and often repetitive gaming technology that has always offered the promise of deeper immersion, but never really truly gotten there. While there are seams in the Project Esther\u2019s Sensa HD Haptic technology, they are extremely tight, and the overall experience this chair cushion provides is difficult-to-describe (though I certainly tried in a hands-on preview of Project Esther earlier this week).\nThe long and short of what makes this cushion so different is that while many haptic products promise more immersive gaming, Project Esther comes way closer to what most people are hoping for than any competing product on the market thanks to its directional HD haptics. The closest analogue to this would be Dolby Atmos, but for haptics \u2013 and with a software development kit for game developers to fine-tune the haptic experience of their games, this device is one of the few products of this kind that gamers are really going to want if it goes on-sale.\nBest mobile accessory: Clicks Keyboard\nThe question isn't whether you need Clicks, the premium new keyboard that attaches to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro. The question is why aren't there more keyboards for smartphones already? If you write a lot of messages, or even if you just write captions for your favorite photos and videos, Clicks gives you a smart new way to type that frees up a ton of screen space.\nIt's pricey at $139, but it feels like a premium keyboard for your Pro-level iPhone. It's got a backlight, and it comes in a staid London Blue or smiley-faced Bumblebee yellow that will attract glances from curious keyboard newbs and old school BlackBerry fans alike. We've never done more writing on our phones, and Clicks strongly makes the case that physical keys are due a comeback.\nBest smart home innovation: Nanoleaf Orchestrator\nNanoleaf's Orchestrator software is a massive improvement upon the smart lighting company's existing Rhythm tool, taking music visualization to new heights. Not only does it interpret the beat and melodies into color palettes and motions (and allow for personalization, too), but you can even group your devices into different parts of the tracks, too.\nWhere Rhythm uses on-device built-in microphones to detect sound, Orchestrator picks apart music played through your laptop or PC, identifying the mood and layers of a track to create a gorgeous complimentary light show. The only software we've tried that comes close is Philips Hue's, but that's exclusive to Spotify and way less customizable.\nAs of writing, it's only available on the Nanoleaf Desktop App, but we'd be very surprised if a mobile equivalent didn't roll out within the next year or two. The fun this can add to your smart lighting setup can't be underestimated\nBest small appliance: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nWhile the robot vacuum and mop part of this product itself isn't brand new at CES, having released late last year, this new edition of the Deebot X2 is pretty special and novel; it features a connected handheld vacuum (or one with a handle), which also auto-empties itself into the same vacuum bag as the robot vacuum when you dock it. The space-saving potential is excellent, but more than that, the vacuum is pretty accomplished, too.\nThe Deebot X2 robot vacuum is square-shaped, optimized for better wall-to-wall and corner cleaning, and sporting a gorgeous, minimalist design. Plus, thanks to the Matter 1.2 rollout, the bot is now Matter-compatible, though it also supports Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri Shortcuts natively, as well as its own Yiko 2.0 voice control.\nIt's just a great pairing that brings a feature that's been a recent and extremely convenient feature of the best robot vacuums (the self-emptying tool) to the world of the best cordless vacuums. When you've finished, you just pop it back to charge and you don't need to think about the dust. We love it.\nBest wellness tech: Baracoda BMind\nThe BMind smart mirror is a glimpse into the bathrooms of the future. Powered by generative AI and Natural Language Processing, it offers personalized recommendations based on the user's mental state, all controlled by a combination of gesture and voice commands. It can do things like detect that you look sad, and ask you how your day is going, and make changes based on your response.\nFor example, you can say that you're feeling sad or down, and it will use light therapy techniques, changing its LED light output in a way that can help to improve your mood. It also has mindfulness exercises such as guided meditation built in that it can suggest and run too \u2013 all provided through the CareOS interface and programs from ThrivePal. Its built-in camera has face detection so everything is personalized for you (and kept only to you).\nIt can also help in more physical ways, with guided toothbrushing coaching, and skin analysis, so it can make recommendations for how to, say, reduce redness in your face. If it works as well as BMind says, it could be a much more convenient way to get help and advice than by reaching for your phone and it'll be more personalized.\nBest wearable: Evie Smart Ring\nNot only is Evie a rare gem among health devices at CES, in that it will actually launch, but it's also a wearable device that puts women first in all the best ways.\nFrom its gorgeous, open design that accommodates the natural fluctuations in a woman's body over the course of the month, to its intelligent application and AI insights engine, Evie's all about putting women's health center-stage in an industry where it's often an afterthought.\nBest of all, it's completely subscription free, meaning you can enjoy its medical-grade sleep, blood oxygen, heart health detection and menstrual data insights without worrying about the on-going cost. This looks like a great rival to the best smart rings.\nBest health tech: Withings BeamO\nThe idea of a do-it-all, handheld medical diagnostic devices is not new; fans of Star Trek well remember Dr. McCoy\u2019s Tricorder. Withings' BeamO is not quite that, but may be an exciting baby step in the right direction. It\u2019s a lightweight, compact, all-in-one device that can run ECG, blood oxygen, temperature and even stethoscope tests.\nYou don\u2019t wave BeamO in front of a body to detect trouble. Instead, you\u2019ll place BeamO against your temple or chest (or hold the sensors on it for SPO2 and ECG readings). The exciting thing is that whatever data it collects can instantly be shared with your healthcare professional who will know how to read your health stats.\nBest outdoor tech: Swarovski Ax Visio\nHigh-end binoculars with a digital camera built-in so that you can capture what you're looking at are nothing new. High-end binoculars with a digital camera and AI recognition software that can tell you what you're looking at? That's new, and extremely cool. The neural processing unit in these binoculars is similar to what you get in the latest phones, and has been trained to identify 9,000 species of birds, so you no longer need to refer to a book or call your twitching uncle to discover what was hanging out on that cliff.\nSimply take a look through them like any other binoculars to find something interesting, and when you see a mystery bird, press a button on the side that will show a red circle in your vision. Get your bird into this circle, and its name will appear underneath. It's the ideal use of this kind of technology, and a perfectly futuristic upgrade to the most old-school of products.\nBest yard tech: Weber Summit Grill\nWeber makes some of the most effective grills and smokers you can buy, and now the company is offering one of the most advanced with the Weber Summit Smart Grill. This is for aspiring or accomplished chefs, as the featureset could cater a serious party. Besides the six burners, the infrared element up top, and the rotisserie spit, you get a digital PID controller that truly represents the next generation of grilling. It monitors everything, from the flame activity to the temperature to the gas levels, and gives you helpful feedback where to place your food for the best direct and indirect heat cooking.\nThe Weber Summit grill includes remarkable safety features that check the fire constantly, and even though it looks like a fancy computer, it can handle the same extreme heat and cold weather that you'd expect from any Weber grill, so it's not more delicate just because it's smarter. This will turn anyone in a true grilling pro.\nBest science tech: Celestron Origin\nAmateur astronomers dream of powerful telescopes and long warm nights of star gazing. The reality is the best time for star gazing is in the winter, and most telescopes are exercises in frustration. Smart telescopes bridge the gap between our stargazing wishes and the ability to carry them out, and Celestron Origin takes the concept to the next level.\nIt does all the hard work of finding celestial bodies, and will let you schedule when you want it to find and capture imagery of the planets, stars, and galaxies. Better yet, you can do it all from the warmth and comfort of your living room couch, using an iPad or your Phone. Want to see what it captured? It\u2019ll show up on your screen and you can cast it to your living room TV. This is the kind of armchair astronomy we can get behind.\nBest car tech: BMW Augmented Reality Ride Concept\nYou wouldn\u2019t think augmented reality and driving would go perfect together, and yet BMW showed me how wearing Xreal Air 2 glasses inside a beautiful EV BMW would somehow feel natural and even useful. The concept is simple: Xreal\u2019s glasses integrate with your phone, which is connected to the car to deliver real-time AR imagery that can tell you things about your trip that you might otherwise miss or have to glance down at a screen to see. Think direction, hazards, and indications that you\u2019re veering into the other lane, and you get the idea. The concept even extends to your passengers, who could, with their own glasses, turn any car surface into a screen for bingeing on the road.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.
