        "raw_content": "Tesla Gets New 1 Million-Square-Foot Building Outside Houston, Texas\nThere are still few details about the building's purpose, though it may be a battery material production and storage center.\nIt seems Tesla is forever expanding, and now, not long after we learned that it's working on a new lithium refinery near Corpus Christi, Texas, it has acquired access to a 1 million-square-foot building outside of Austin, Texas.\nBeing that the new facility is some two hours from Tesla's headquarters in Austin and three hours from Corpus Christi, it's honestly hard to know what the US EV maker has planned. According to Electrek, the new building is located at 111 Empire West in Brookshire, Texas, just over 30 minutes outside of downtown Houston.\nTesla's newest factory, Giga Texas, has been open for business for a time now, and there's word that the company is expanding the site significantly. CEO Elon Musk also moved Tesla's headquarters out of California and into Texas, though the Fremont factory is still integral in producing Tesla's full lineup of electric cars and SUVs.\nSince opening the factory, Tesla is expanding in Austin, and also into other areas of Texas. Musk's SpaceX also has multiple locations in the Lone Star State.\nAs Tesla makes an ongoing effort to handle as much as possible in-house, it's\u00a0currently working on a new lithium refinery in an area outside of Corpus Christi. Musk has made it clear that the world needs more lithium refineries and battery makers, and Tesla will be on both lists. Being able to source materials and produce batteries in the US could ensure that Tesla's vehicles remain eligible for the revamped US federal EV tax credit.\nAccording to Electrek via the Houston Chronicle, Tesla is leasing the new building in Brookshire, which is \"part of the 300-acre Empire West Business Park.\" The publication reports that very little is known about Tesla's need for the facility, and the company didn't respond to a request for comment.\nThe interim city administrator for Brookshire,\u00a0Mike Barnes, admitted that while he's aware of Tesla's project, it's only due to permitting. He added that some people from Tesla have reportedly been in talks with city workers, but there are few details available.\nSee More Tesla Texas News:\nElectrek reported on some job openings most likely related to the new building. It notes that they're associated with \"a warehouse and production.\" Digging into the posted positions, the publication has gleaned that the new facility could potentially produce materials for battery cell production, and possibly store materials and batteries.\nSource: Electrek\nTrending\nCar Buying Service\nGet upfront price offers on local inventory.\nSearch for:\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article"

Universities consider harnessing micro nuclear reactors.\nWhile the thought of nuclear power conjures giant cylindrical concrete towers, American universities are exploring building miniature nuclear reactors to generate electricity for campuses to combat climate change. Are these reactors feasible and safe?\nLoading...\nFebruary 10, 2023\nIf your image of nuclear power is giant, cylindrical concrete cooling towers pouring out steam on a site that takes up hundreds of acres of land, soon there will be an alternative: tiny nuclear reactors that produce only one-hundredth the electricity and can even be delivered on a truck.\nSmall but meaningful amounts of electricity \u2013 nearly enough to run a small campus, a hospital, or a military complex, for example \u2013 will pulse from a new generation of micronuclear reactors. Now, some universities are taking interest.\n\u201cWhat we see is these advanced reactor technologies having a real future in decarbonizing the energy landscape in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d said Caleb Brooks, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nThe tiny reactors carry some of the same challenges as large-scale nuclear, such as how to dispose of radioactive waste and how to make sure they are secure. Supporters say those issues can be managed and the benefits outweigh any risks.\nUniversities are interested in the technology not just to power their buildings but to see how far it can go in replacing the coal and gas-fired energy that causes climate change. The University of Illinois hopes to advance the technology as part of a clean energy future, Mr. Brooks said. The school plans to apply for a construction permit for a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor developed by the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation and aims to start operating it by early 2028. Mr. Brooks is the project lead.\nMicroreactors will be \u201ctransformative\u201d because they can be built in factories and hooked up on site in a plug-and-play way, said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Buongiorno studies the role of nuclear energy in a clean energy world.\n\u2018Time for us to leave\u2019: Gaza reporter, again, joins thousands fleeing\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to see, nuclear energy on demand as a product, not as a big mega project,\u201d he said.\nBoth Mr. Buongiorno and Marc Nichol, senior director for new reactors at the Nuclear Energy Institute, view the interest by schools as the start of a trend.\nLast year, Penn State University signed a memorandum of understanding with Westinghouse to collaborate on microreactor technology. Mike Shaqqo, the company\u2019s senior vice president for advanced reactor programs, said universities are going to be \u201cone of our key early adopters for this technology.\u201d\nPenn State wants to prove the technology so that Appalachian industries, such as steel and cement manufacturers, may be able to use it, said Professor Jean Paul Allain, head of the nuclear engineering department. Those two industries tend to burn dirty fuels and have very high emissions. Using a microreactor also could be one of several options to help the university use less natural gas and achieve its long-term carbon emissions goals, he said.\n\u201cI do feel that microreactors can be a game-changer and revolutionize the way we think about energy,\u201d Mr. Allain said.\nTalk of a Trump \u2018dictatorship\u2019: What\u2019s behind the fears\nFor Mr. Allain, microreactors can complement renewable energy by providing a large amount of power without taking up much land. A 10-megawatt microreactor could go on less than an acre, whereas windmills or a solar farm would need far more space to produce 10 megawatts, he added. The goal is to have one at Penn State by the end of the decade.\nPurdue University in Indiana is working with Duke Energy on the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet its long-term energy needs.\nNuclear reactors that are used for research are nothing new on campus. About two dozen U.S. universities have them. But using them as an energy source is new.\nBack at the University of Illinois, Mr. Brooks explains the microreactor would generate heat to make steam. While the excess heat from burning coal and gas to make electricity is often wasted, Mr. Brooks sees the steam production from the nuclear microreactor as a plus, because it\u2019s a carbon-free way to deliver steam through the campus district heating system to radiators in buildings, a common heating method for large facilities in the Midwest and Northeast. The campus has hundreds of buildings.\nThe 10-megawatt microreactor wouldn\u2019t meet all of the demand, but it would serve to demonstrate the technology, as other communities and campuses look to transition away from fossil fuels, Mr. Brooks said.\nMeekness takes over in Guatemala\nOne company that is building microreactors that the public can get a look at today is Last Energy, based in Washington, D.C. It built a model reactor in Brookshire, Texas that\u2019s housed in an edgy cube covered in reflective metal.\nNow it\u2019s taking that apart to test how to transport the unit. A caravan of trucks is taking it to Austin, where company founder Bret Kugelmass is scheduled to speak at the South by Southwest conference and festival.\nMr. Kugelmass, a technology entrepreneur and mechanical engineer, is talking with some universities, but his primary focus is on industrial customers. He\u2019s working with licensing authorities in the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania to try to get his first reactor running in Europe in 2025.\nThe urgency of the climate crisis means zero-carbon nuclear energy must be scaled up soon, he said.\n\u201cIt has to be a small, manufactured product as opposed to a large, bespoke construction project,\u201d he said.\nTraditional nuclear power costs billions of dollars. An example is two additional reactors at a plant in Georgia that will end up costing more than $30 billion.\nHow Denver met a goal to shelter 1,000 people\nThe total cost of Last Energy\u2019s microreactor, including module fabrication, assembly, and site prep work, is under $100 million, the company says.\nWestinghouse, which has been a mainstay of the nuclear industry for over 70 years, is developing its \u201ceVinci\u201d microreactor, Mr. Shaqqo said, and is aiming to get the technology licensed by 2027.\nThe Department of Defense is working on a microreactor, too. Project Pele is a DOD prototype mobile nuclear reactor under design at the Idaho National Laboratory.\nAbilene Christian University in Texas is leading a group of three other universities with the company Natura Resources to design and build a research microreactor cooled by molten salt to allow for high-temperature operations at low pressure, in part to help train the next-generation nuclear workforce.\nBut not everyone shares the enthusiasm. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, called it \u201ccompletely unjustified.\u201d\nMicroreactors in general will require much more uranium to be mined and enriched per unit of electricity generated than conventional reactors do, he said. He said he also expects fuel costs to be substantially higher and that more depleted uranium waste could be generated compared to conventional reactors.\nShe\u2019ll make you look twice: LA street artist spreads whimsy, hope\n\u201cI think those who are hoping that microreactors are going to be the silver bullet for solving the climate change crisis are simply betting on the wrong horse,\u201d he said.\nMr. Lyman also said he fears microreactors could be targeted for a terrorist attack, and some designs would use fuels that could be attractive to terrorists seeking to build crude nuclear weapons. The UCS does not oppose using nuclear power, but wants to make sure it\u2019s safe.\nThe United States does not have a national storage facility for storing spent nuclear fuel and it\u2019s piling up. Microreactors would only compound the problem and spread the radioactive waste around, Mr. Lyman said.\nA 2022 Stanford-led study found that smaller modular reactors \u2013 the next size up from micro \u2013 will generate more waste than conventional reactors. Lead author Lindsay Krall said this week that the design of microreactors would make them subject to the same issue.\nGet stories that empower and uplift daily.\nAlready a subscriber?

My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things \u2018boring\u2019 simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.\u201d\nIf you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We\u2019re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We\u2019re the bran muffin of journalism.\nBut you know what? We change lives. And I\u2019m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.\nThe Monitor is a peculiar little publication that\u2019s hard for the world to figure out. We\u2019re run by a church, but we\u2019re not only for church members and we\u2019re not about converting people. We\u2019re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper\u2019s founding in 1908.\nWe have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We\u2019re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, \u201cYou are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for bran muffin\njournalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.
