        "raw_content": "Cordless Robotic Lawn Mower Unveiled at CES 2024\nYou can now ditch your old lawn mower for a more advanced replacement -- a robotic lawn mower. The robot can do the job for you, making the upgrade very convenient.\nMeet HorizonUI -- The Robotic Lawn Mower\nCES, the most powerful tech event in the world, kicked off on Tuesday with new surprising machines. Among CES 2024's highlights is the introduction of Aiper's HorizonUI\u00a0-- the robot that can mow the lawn for you!\nIn a press release, Aiper said the typical homeowner in the United States will spend about 70 hours a year maintaining their lawn. Traditional push or ride-on manual lawnmowers use a lot of gas, are noisy, difficult to operate, and take up room. The company doesn't just want to reduce your mowing hours but entirely remove it from your to-dos with the arrival of HorizonUI.\nHorizon U1 is elegant, lightweight, cordless, and compact. Most importantly, it is designed to automatically cut any grass in yards up to 32,000 square feet. With the Horizon U1, maintaining even the messiest lawns has never been easy.\nIn addition to wireless mowing capabilities, the new robot will have cutting-edge technology that allows the lawnmower to cut grass quickly and effectively. Aiper also announced the release of its first-ever app for iOS and Android, which will make lawn maintenance easier than ever and allow for remote control of the robot among other features. The software will be available in Q1 2024. Starting in Q3 of 2024, the Horizon U1 will be sold on Aiper.com.\nALSO READ:\u00a0AI-Powered Robot Chemist From China Could Generate Oxygen in Mars\nAiper Unveils 5 Robot Pool Cleaners\nAside from a lawn mower, Aiper brings\u00a0five robot pool cleaners\u00a0to the public in its Scuba series. The robots offer different cleaning capacities for above-ground and below-ground swimming pools of various sizes. A pool full of leaves, hair, filth, sand, insects, green algae, microbes, and other particle matter can all be cleaned by one of these.\nThe company's main pool cleaner, the Scuba S1 ($699.99), was selected as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree. In 2.5 hours, the equipment can thoroughly clean 1,600 square feet of in-ground pools. Better traction and superior obstacle traversal are offered by its caterpillar treads. Four cleaning options are available to owners: floor, wall, floor, and wall, and an environmental mode that cleans the pool automatically every 48 hours.\nThe robot increases cleaning coverage from edge to edge by following the natural flow of the pool with Aiper's unique WavePath Navigation Technology 2.0. This bot can be equipped with an optional solar panel accessory to charge its batteries without requiring an outdoor outlet.\nThe Scuba S1 Pro ($1,199.99) has the same WavePath Navigation Technology 2.0, dual ultra-fine filters, and caterpillar treads as the Scuba S1. It can navigate around obstacles thanks to the addition of sensors.\nScuba S1 Pro is intended for larger in-ground pools up to 2,150 square feet. It has the same cleaning modes as Scuba S1 plus what Aiper claims to be the first horizontal waterline cleaning mode, WaveLine Technology.\nSales of the Scuba S1 are scheduled to begin in late January.\nRELATED ARTICLE: NASA's DART Spacecraft Worked!

Weber Summit Smart Gas Grill\nPhoto: businesswire.com\nAmong the many exciting new products to come in 2024, we've got our eyes on Weber's most advanced grill yet\u2014the ultra-premium Summit Smart Gas Grill. This new addition is the most technologically advanced grill in Weber's gas grill lineup, designed for home cooks and grill masters alike.
