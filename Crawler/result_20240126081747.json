        "raw_content": "CES 2024: new lidars for old\n10\u00a0Jan\u00a02024\nAeva reveals Daimler Truck as major customer; Cepton and Hesai launch new products; SiLC extends range beyond 2\u00c2\u00a0km.\nAtlas lidar: no active cooling\nAs in previous years, several lidar developers have announced significant developments in technology and commercial traction in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) event in Las Vegas. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our round-up of the latest news:\nAeva and Daimler Trucks deal\nAs well as the launch of its new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lidar aimed at mass-production deployments in the automotive sector, Silicon Valley-based Aeva revealed that it had signed up Daimler Truck as a major customer for the technology.\nUnder the collaboration, Aeva will supply the Atlas systems to Daimler Truck and also work with Daimler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software subsidiary Torc Robotics, to enable so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Level 4\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd autonomous vehicle capabilities - initially on Class 8 Freightliner Cascadia trucks.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Daimler Truck intends to integrate the lidar sensors directly in its production process, making it easy for customers to buy autonomous ready trucks directly out of its manufacturing plants without the need for sensors to be retrofitted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Aeva, which announced last week that a production ramp is expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by mid-decade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nAeva specializes in ultra-compact frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar that senses both the position and velocity of objects on the road, and said previously that its technology would be replacing older time-of-flight lidar sensors. It expects initial sales revenues for the Daimler deal by the end of March.\nJoanna Buttler, the head of Daimler Truck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Autonomous Technology Group, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with Torc, we are well on track to offer autonomous trucks to the US market by 2027.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThose trucks are set to be equipped with sensor sets combining FMCW lidar with radar and camera technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This enables safe handling adapted to the respective situation on highways, surface roads and ramps, as well as when turning at controlled intersections,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd state the firms.\nAeva CTO and co-founder Mina Rezk said of the latest product launch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlas is the key development that will enable OEMs to equip their vehicles with advanced safety and automated driving features at highway speeds by addressing challenging use cases that could not be solved before.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Importantly, we believe it will accelerate the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition to FMCW lidar technology, which we believe is increasingly considered to be the end state for lidar, offering greatly enhanced perception solutions that leverage its unique instant velocity data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nCepton claims longer range with 905\u00c2\u00a0nm lasers\nCepton,\nAeva\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Silicon Valley neighbor, also unveiled a new automotive-grade lidar unit at CES. Named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is said to feature a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revolutionary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beam-steering technology, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MagnoSteer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultra is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slimmest adaptive, long-range lidar, designed based on real OEM requirements for next-generation consumer vehicle ADAS and automated driving capabilities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stated the company, claiming a range of 300\u00c2\u00a0meters for objects with 10\u00c2\u00a0per cent reflectivity.\nWith a 12\u00c2\u00a0W power rating, the new unit is said to consume less than half the power of typical scanning systems that deliver comparable performance, while taking up just a quarter of the space.\nBrunno Moretti, Ception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior VP of product and commercial operations, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Powered by MagnoSteer, Ultra breaks the performance bottleneck of 905\u00c2\u00a0nm lidars while taking advantage of a mature, mass-market-ready laser technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMoretti says that the extended range is thus achieved without the need for fiber laser components operating at a longer wavelength - a technology associated with higher cost and much higher power consumption.\nCompany CEO and co-founder Jun Pei added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By utilizing our experience in industrializing lidar for mass-market applications, we expect to reduce Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development time by a third as compared to the past, thereby shortening time to market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHesai's 'Maxwell' facility in China\nHesai goes behind windshield\nNot to be outdone, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hesai revealed two new lidar products at the Las Vegas event. Rated as a market leader by analysts at Yole Intelligence, the Chinese company is claiming a range performance of 300\u00c2\u00a0meters for 10\u00c2\u00a0per cent reflectivity objects with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AT512\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unit - and a maximum range beyond a quarter of a mile.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This game-changing lidar means AT512 equipped ADAS systems will have 40\u00c2\u00a0per cent more reaction time to avoid dangerous road conditions and significantly improve transportation safety,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the company, with CEO and co-founder David Li adding:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our core belief that intelligent manufacturing needs to be part of our R&D efforts has helped us move beyond traditional 1550\u00c2\u00a0nm laser-based lidar to more advanced 905\u00c2\u00a0nm technology as borne out by the superior performance, quality, and reliability of our AT512.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHesai also unveiled its ultra-thin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ET25\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd product, which is designed to be integrated behind a vehicle's windshield for ADAS applications. It boasts 250\u00c2\u00a0meters of range at 10% reflectivity.\nLi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We're already working with leading OEMs to integrate the ET25 into series production vehicles with the start of production planned for Q1 of 2025.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe Chinese company also says it has now completed construction of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maxwell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd innovation facility - said to feature the world's most advanced lidar testing lab - and adds that it has signed a supply deal with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the world's most revered automotive brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide its AT128 lidar for a flagship model of electric vehicle.\nSiLC goes beyond 2km with Eyeonic\nSiLC Technologies, which like Aeva is an FMCW lidar specialist, used the CES event to promote the ultra-long-range performance of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eyeonic Vision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sensor - claiming a new world-best of beyond 2\u00c2\u00a0kilometers.\nThe extended performance and precision of Eyeonic is said to be pivotal in applications such as uncrewed autonomous system detection and discrimination, a field where SiLC is collaborating closely with defense-oriented autonomy specialist High Point Aerotechnologies (HPA).\nSiLC CEO Mehdi Asghari said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our latest achievement with the Eyeonic Vision Sensor is not just about setting new records; it's about enabling practical, real-world applications that require the highest levels of precision and reliability.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our collaboration with HPA to incorporate lidar into their counter-UAS systems is a testament to the versatility and impact of our technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHPA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CTO, Jeff Maas, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SiLC has made tremendous strides in advancing lidar technology for perimeter security and drone detection.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their investments in extending range, polarimetry, waveform control, and optical signal processing for the Eyeonic Vision Sensor endeavors to enhance target differentiation of ambiguous targets in clutter-limited environments. This lidar technology is a crucial complement to radar and visible/infrared camera sensors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"
