Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential. Here's how it happens - and when"

Ballie projects itself into your heart\nBefore CES even began Samsung declared it was all-in on AI. This includes using vision models to tell you what food to make based on the contents of your fridge, launching new large language models for its cellphones and bringing smart robots to your home.\nBallie is part entertainment device, part chatbot and part home assistant. The round robot can project things onto the floor, wall or ceiling as it follows you around the home like a lost puppy.\nThe yellow bot can also message its owner to give an update on the pets, manage smart tech in the home and even answer calls on your behalf.\nThe problem is right now it's nothing more than a video. When the first version of Ballie was unveiled in 2020 a model was whizzing around the stage. This year we\u2019ve only seen it in a video, with no details on price, launch or availability.\n2. LG smart home agent\nYou wait all day for a bus then two come along at once. Or in this case, you don\u2019t wait for a tiny, cute robot that can link up with your home appliances but two still come along at once.\nNot to be outdone by Samsung, LG revealed its smart home agent. An AI-packed little bot on two legs that rolls around your home keeping an eye on your smart tech, pets and you.\nLG\u2019s little agent is basically a smart hub that can move about. It has a built-in large language model voice assistant so you can communicate with it in much the same way you can with ChatGPT voice and it can monitor your mood.\nConnected through the LG smart home platform ThinQ, it can manage washers, ovens and even refrigerators unaided. It uses machine learning to understand how the family interacts and uses devices and can perform voice and facial analysis. Like Bailee it has no price, release data or physical model to try out.\n3. Rise of the lawnbot \u2014 Segway Navimow\nRobot lawnmowers aren't a new idea. They've been around about as long as the robot vacuum with new models and companies rising and falling.\nThis year at CES we've seen a multitude of mowers, blowers and other gardening aids and one of the highlights is the Segway Navimow.\nThe Navimow H Series has been available in Europe for some time but is now coming to the U.S. for the first time. It uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard and uses a small base station when GPS isn't available.\nThe H Series range features a BladeHalt sensor, a Rain sensor, an Ultrasonic sensor (H3000), and a VisionFence sensor (H3000), so it should be able to more easily detect and avoid objects on your lawn.\nPricing has not yet been made available for the U.S. market, but when it was released in Europe, the H500E was priced at \u20ac1,199 (about $1,300), the H800 was at \u20ac1,499, and the H3000E cost \u20ac2,499 (about $2,700).\n4. Oro is a buddy for your pets\nBoth Samsung's Ballie and the LG smart home agent boast pet-sitting capabilities, but the adorable big-eyed ORo from Ogmen Robotics goes a step further, being designed as a ball-throwing, food-delivering pet buddy.\nThe autonomous robot can take care of your dog when you're not at home. Priced at $799 and available from April it is fitted way a suit of sensors, two-way audio and an interactive video screen that lets you chat to your canine from anywhere.\nORo can also capture images and videos of your pet at play that you can then share online or keep to look back on. it also has a built-in food dispenser that can launch nibbles at your good boy and a separate automatic food bowl that the bot can control.\nOne of the most impressive features is its built-in AI that learns by watching the way your pet plays. It understands its behavior patterns and can play music or throw a ball when Rover becomes agitated or restless.\nORo is currently available for pre-order with a $299 downpayment with the remaining $500 due when it is ready to ship. It comes in cozy carbon and ivory mist. The price includes hte base-station, the dog bowl and the robot.\n5. Climbing up the stairs \u2014 MOBINN from RcLab\nThe MOBINN is a delivery robot with flexible wheels that allow it to drive on even ground and climb stairs while bringing you that parcel you need urgently.\nIt is a research example at the moment without a date for release or a price but it can maintain a constant and steady horizon for the main body ensuring the Starbucks you ordered doesn't spill on its way from the coffee shop down the street.\nThe M3 has a LiDAR-based mapping system to allow it to operate regardless of the terrain and can also work in rain, snow and at night.\n6. The Loona companion bot\nSometimes all you need to cheer you up is a pet but that isn't always practical. Enter Loona, the companion robot that uses ChatGPT to provide natural conversation with its owner.\nBuilt by Beijing KEYi Technology, the toy can play a range of interactive games, is a moveable home monitor and acts as a programming learning platform.\nThe cute little bot also includes gesture recognition technology, voice commands and graphic programming to allow users to create their own instructions.\nThe base model is $380 with a range of accessories and add-ons available including coding kits, game prop kits and a charging dock.\n7. Robot vacuum phone home\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to the ability to call its owner or have the owner call in remotely.\n6. Elderly companion robot\nIntuition Robotics is bringing generative AI to its elderly care companion robot ElliQ. The third generation of the bot, known as the ElliQ 3 uses AI to offer more engaging and two-way conversations for its users.\nSmaller and lighter than previous versions it also includes a screen fully integrated into the device rather than as a standalone tool.\nA built-in AI processing unit and a RAM increase also makes it easier to use and interact with as it can handle natural language conversations.\nIt also uses generative AI to better utilize information the user shares with the device such as favorite color, pet and religion. It can reference this information in conversations and choose activities based on user interests.\n7. A coffee making robot\nADAM is a robot barista from Richtech Robotics. Impressing at CES 2024 it can make hot or cold coffee with 21 unique menu offerings. It can also turn its hand to cold brew and Boba or mix up a cocktail.\nThe two-armed robot can interact with customers to take their order through a natural language interface, use its arms to make the drink and even wash up.\nEach arm can work independently to create two drinks at the same time and can be customized with different phrases depending on the use case or company.\nADAM is only available as a rental device for specific events.

        "raw_content": "Ogmen ORo is a smart robot companion and guardian for your beloved dog\nRobots are invading our homes, in one way or another. There are the rolling discs that are robot vacuum cleaners, and there are a growing number of cute robots that aim to provide entertainment and sometimes even security for the whole family. Well, at least the human members of the family. Some households have \u201csmall\u201d a.k.a. furry family members, and these are often left unserved by these modern innovations. Worse, they\u2019re sometimes even put at risk because of how some smart home robots are not designed with pets in mind. Turning the tables around, Ogmen Robotics is revealing at CES 2024 a kind of intelligent home robot that was designed from the ground up to be the \u201cpawfect\u201d playmate, guardian, and caretaker for your canine best friend.\nDesigner: Ogmen Robotics\nAt first glance, the Ogmen ORo looks like one of those robots on wheels designed for human use. After all, it has the semblance of a face, or at least eyes, on a tablet-like screen and a somewhat tall frame that loosely resembles a body. They say that looks can be deceiving, and that\u2019s definitely the case here since all of the ORo\u2019s features were carefully selected for the benefit of dogkind primarily, and humans only by association.\nAt the top of the list of those features is its ability to provide physical, mental, and emotional stimulation through playful activities. It keeps track of the dog\u2019s health and even detects when they\u2019re feeling anxious, at which point ORo will play soothing music to help calm them down. It can even help owners train their dogs through obedience games and virtual training services right at home.\nWhen paired with Orgmen\u2019s food and medicine dispenser, the ORo robot ensures that the pooch gets a balanced diet while also monitoring their eating habits. For humans, ORo offers the benefits of remote connectivity and interaction, allowing owner and pet to bond even when they\u2019re far apart. The robot can also take photos of the bet\u2019s precious moments, allowing you to easily share and boast on social media.\nTechnology doesn\u2019t need to benefit humans only. In fact, it should be used to benefit all, including the planet as well as our furry friends. Ogmen\u2019s ORo puts those very same technologies that power human smart appliances and devices at the service of the four-legged members of the family. After all, having happy and healthy family members is a good thing for both humans and animals alike.\nRelated Posts\nIncredibly compact e-scooter folds into a laptop-sized suitcase for maximum mobility\nPersonal mobility devices such as e-scooters, hoverboards, and the like have risen in popularity in recent years.

Reviews ethics statement\nWould You Let a Robot Watch Your Dog? This Tech Startup Thinks You Should\nThe Oro Dog Companion Robot feeds your pup and plays soothing music or a game of fetch when you're not around.\nThe Oro Dog Companion has been trained on the behavior of the 10 most popular dog breeds.\nLeaving a dog home alone, even for a few hours, can be a major bummer for you and the dog. Oro, a new dog nanny robot unveiled by Ogmen Robotics at CES 2024 is programmed to recognize signs of anxiety or restlessness in your dog and provide engagement, comfort and, of course, treats when you're not around.\nWe got a first look at the pet companion that aims to soothe and entertain your pup. While it wasn't being tested at the show, only displayed, a spokesperson for the brand said the $800\u00a0Oro Dog Companion Robot\u00a0will begin shipping in April.\nOro may be the world's smartest pet care system. I met the robot nanny at CES 2024.\nThe Oro is built with\u00a0advanced AI, founder Divye Bhutani said as the robot waited obediently beside us at the brand's CES booth. The smart bot pet nanny is fitted with two-way audio and a video screen so you can interact with your dog remotely. It even allows you to capture images and videos to share with friends.\nA built-in dispenser launches treats for your good boy or girl on your command, and a separate automatic food bowl releases food on schedule, or on command if you're away during your pet's regular feeding time.\nFeed your dog on command, even from afar, with the automatic dog bowl.\nA ball thrower housed in Oro's middle will play fetch for as long as your canine can keep up -- as long as you can train them to bring the ball back. (My terrier has yet to master this skill.) Oro can also navigate the home autonomously using an advanced camera and lidar-based mapping system to tag along with your pup and clue you in on the action.\nPerhaps most impressive is Oro's advanced AI learning, which helps the bot get to know your four-legged pal. Oro aims to learn your dog's behavior patterns and snap into action with soothing music or physical interaction when it senses distress, restlessness or the desire to play. Because distress manifests differently in different dogs, Oro comes programmed to recognize audible and physical signs of distress in 10 of the most popular domestic breeds.\nIf Oro can't solve the issue on its own, it will alert you remotely to your dog's most pressing needs.\nIf you're not sure when your pooch is due for their next rabies shot or dose of heartworm medicine, the integrated Oro app will diligently record and track health documents and medical records, so you never fall behind.\nThe pet companion robot was present but not in action at the big consumer tech show in Vegas this week. Frankly, we can't wait to see it do its thing.\nMore from CES 2024\nKitchen and Household Guides\nAppliances\nOther Home Guides\nTools and Outdoors\nOther Home & Office\nMeal Delivery"

        "raw_content": "AI central: Gadget highlights from CES 2024\nArtificial intelligence was presented as the central innovation adopted by technology companies that appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show this week.\nLas Vegas hosted CES 2024 from Tuesday to Friday, where consumer technology companies and startups received a chance to show off some of their latest devices to journalists and retail executives alike. The event is often a mixture of updated product lines, odd inventions, and innovative developments that may change how people use their devices. But one of the central themes that tech companies focused on at CES this year was how AI was being implemented into so many devices that users could buy in the future.\nHere are the highlights of CES 2024.\nAI in Everything\nArtificial intelligence is not a new technology, but the surge of interest in ChatGPT since December 2022 has made generative AI a far more prominent product option for developers to incorporate. It also turned the term into a buzzword to play off of. The technology was embedded into a vast array of products that may eventually hit the marketplace.\nSeveral new Windows laptops will have a CoPilot button added to their keyboard this year. This will give users instant access to Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT-powered interface in Windows 11 and is the first update to a Microsoft keyboard in 30 years.\nSamsung is also adding AI features to its 8K television models, which will use AI to upscale images displayed on the screen to ensure the visual quality fits the highest image standards available. That same AI will also adjust the TV settings based on the sorts of content being displayed. For example, it may change the resolution or lighting of the TV depending on if the user is playing a video game or watching a movie.\nVolkswagen has added ChatGPT to its line of electric vehicles, including the ID 3, ID 4, and ID 5. This will allow users to prompt the chatbot for answers and travel suggestions while the user is in motion.\n#VW + #ChatGPT = \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udd1c With the beginning second quarter of 2024, @volkswagen will be the first volume manufacturer to offer ChatGPT as voice control feature in many models and markets.\ud83d\udca1 This gives you many new opportunities which go far beyond today's voice control!#CES24 pic.twitter.com/w6mMxlcEdu\nRobots\nAutomatons and robots are a common sight on the CES floor, providing or supplementing the user\u2019s needs.\nOgmen Oro Dog Companion Smart Robot The smart bot pet nanny is fitted with two-way audio and a video screen so one can interact with pet dog remotely.

[ \ud83d\udcf9 Ogmen Robotics ] pic.twitter.com/PAVmiY8byh\nFor example, Oro has made a Dog Companion robot with two-way audio and a video screen so pet owners can remotely interact with their pets and even play fetch. The robot\u2019s AI processing will also slowly learn a puppy\u2019s behavior patterns and react if it needs stimulation or comfort whenever the owner is not online.\nThis was cool at #CES2024: @SamsungUS's updated #Ballie robot rolls around your home to surveil the premises, deliver messages to you, controls your smart home, and now has an integrated projector. Check out this video. #CES #CES24 @SamsungCanada #Samsung pic.twitter.com/4G5tP5ckLf\nThere is also Ballie, a personal assistant robot shaped like a ball. While the robot was unveiled in 2020, the new model has been redesigned to operate as an \u201cAlexa on wheels.\u201d The new model can control smart home devices such as lights or thermostats and display images through a built-in projector.\nOdd uses of AI\nAI is not just for traditional practices. Some companies are finding unique ways to allow the technology to enhance your everyday errands.\nFor example, there is the DeRucci Anti-Snore Smart Pillow, a pillow that will track how a user sleeps. If it detects any sounds or movements indicating snoring, it will adjust itself so the sleeper no longer snores.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThere is Seer Grill\u2019s Perfecta, which will grill a user\u2019s meat vertically, and its AI processor will slowly learn how the user prefers to cook their food.\nThe company Capella claims that it has created a phone app to \u201ctranslate\u201d a baby\u2019s cries through machine learning so the parent can determine why they\u2019re crying. The app will reportedly be able to tell the user whether the child is hungry, tired, uncomfortable, or needing a diaper change.\nDC is getting the crime and disorder it voted for\nUS launches second night of airstrikes against Houthis\nKari Lake dunks on DeSantis and Haley for \u2018vanity project\u2019 campaigns...\nFood stamps: Direct payments worth up to $1,751 for January end...\nDC is getting the crime and disorder it voted for\nUS launches second night of airstrikes against Houthis\nKari Lake dunks on DeSantis and Haley for \u2018vanity project\u2019 campaigns...\nFood stamps: Direct payments worth up to $1,751 for January end..."

Way too big to cover everything that happens at the show. However, there are some things that stand out every year that challenge the norm and dazzle the crowd.\nCES 2024 had many of these devices and moments. Here is the best of the best found on the show floor.\nSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wonderland\nKorean electronics conglomerate SK turned one section of the Central Hall inside the Las Vegas Convention Center into a high-tech carnival. Filled with futuristic gadgets and vehicles, the booth was a vision into how technology may influence everything in our lives, even our in-person entertainment.\nWonderland had a fully functional hydrogen fuel cell train that CES visitors could ride in. It had a magic carpet ride featuring an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and, yes, one could ride in it. It had artificial intelligence (AI) fortune tellers giving prognostications, a dancing car, a mini\u00e2\u20ac\u201cLas Vegas Sphere and future environmentally friendly treats. By far one of the coolest things in all of CES 2024.\nSwarovski introduced its AX Visio binoculars at CES 2024 that are AI-based and include a camera that takes high-definition photos and videos. These are designed specifically for bird watchers and the AI identifies the birds as they come into view with pop-ups in the reticle telling the user what they are looking at. According to a marketing manager on the show floor, the AI algorithm could be tailored for many different outdoor fields \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like soccer, football or even NASCAR.\n[Healthcare tech wows tradeshow attendees at 2024 CES]\nBluetti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portable fridge\nThis looks like a mini fridge that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been turned horizontally, which by itself might have some interesting uses. However, this is a Bluetti power station that doubles as a fridge and ice maker. It contains a lithium-ion battery so users can keep drinks cold and make ice but do so without having to plug it in. It can be charged via solar or standard outlet, making it a cool tool to have while camping.\nOgmen Robotics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ORO\nYou have a real dog in your home. How about a robotic dog? But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it just a companion robot as ORO from Ogmen Robotics Inc. does much more. While yes, it does offer mental stimulation and companionship, it features autonomous mobility, adaptable AI and acts as a guardian for the house as well. It monitors the security of the house as well as health monitoring of people inside the home.\nBarunbio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WE-STIM\nWE-STIM stands for wearable electric stimulation which is a type of energy harvesting from body movement. Here, Barunbio put the WE-STIM technology into a pair of leggings for sports users. The technology aids in muscle recovery and minimizes fatigue. The leggings activate by simply wearing them and moving, without any batteries or wires.\nGovee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neon Rope 2\nHong Kong smart lighting vendor Govee brought its cool Neon Rope 2 to CES that allows users to make shapes, spell out words or create wild configurations on walls or the ground or wherever. The rope is flexible enough that curves are easily made but do not degrade the colors.\nThe 2024 CES was definitely a sight to behold!

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 has gone to the dogs\u2014and birds\nCES 2024 opens this week in Las Vegas featuring hundreds of vendors of electronics devices-- not only consumer products--including some of the biggest names in tech like Bosch, Intel, Siemens and Qualcomm. But there are also startups that offer products covering mobility to health to gaming and TVs.\nA few will display new smart tech to better take care of Fido and hungry backyard birds.\nOne startup, Ogmen Robotics,\u00a0based in Massachusetts, showed off ORo, a robotic assistant for dogs with autonomous mobility\u00a0 that moves about a room, can throw a ball and uses AI connected to the robot\u2019s camera and microphone to know what the dog is doing.\nCEO Divye Bhotani told Fierce that the company relied on animal behaviorists to help decide how to best engage man\u2019s best friend especially when they are home alone and could be suffering from separation anxiety. \u00a0Videos on the company website show dogs playing with the robot, and Bhotani said it could be used for dog training.\nThe robot weighs 33 pounds and runs on a 6-core Arm Cortex 64-bit CPU. Sensors include a lidar sensor cliff sensors, proximity sensors and cameras. Charge time is 120 minutes.\u00a0 A tablet-sized display serves as the face of the robot and it can be used to stream a video of a person speaking to a pet.\nORo will go on sale through pet stores and other retailers in April for $899, with a monthly subscription for $15-30, he said.\u00a0 The package includes a mobile robot but also a food container that measures out the correct amount of food at precise times that dog owners can monitor.\nElsewhere at a CES preview event for journalists on Sunday, France-based Invoxia\nshowed off Minitailz, a smart pet collar that provides live GPS tracking and has sensors that also provide a doggy heart health scan and Afib detection. Sensors are matched with AI capabilities that can determine when a bad heart reading is detected, said spokesman Clement Moreau. The device sells for $99 which does not include a separate monthly subscription cost.\nSeparately, a streaming music service from a Japanese company called One by One is in early startup mode, offering music chosen to soothe dogs, especially those that are lonely or experiencing anxiety, said spokeswoman Erika Ogura.\u00a0 The service will sell for $8 a month, with the tempo and melody adjusted for different dog species. In the future, the company plans to sell smart speakers streaming the special content and it hopes to expand the service to other animal breeds, perhaps cows and other animals on farms.\nAlso, China-based Birdfy showed off its outdoor smart bird feeder that includes a motion-sensitive camera to provide\u00a0close-ups of wild birds feeding on seeds with alerts sent to a smartphone along with still images, video \u00a0and audio of the birds.\nWith AI, Birdfy is able to determine the bird species, although the company recently admitted to customers that its AI classifications were not always accurate. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d the company said in a notice posted on its customer app.\nThe Birdfy feeder currently sells for $129 and the app is free. \u00a0\u00a0A solar panel to charge the camera is sold separately."

This year\u2019s event, which includes both newcomers and well-known brands in the sector, highlights ground-breaking advancements in the pet technology space. CES 2024 has certainly gone to the dogs\u2014and birds\u2014with robotic assistants for dogs, smart collars with health monitoring features, and even a streaming music service tailored for our four-legged companions.\nOgmen Robotics Introduces ORo: The Robotic Companion for Dogs\nOne particularly noteworthy exhibit is by Ogmen Robotics, which introduces ORo, a robotic assistant made to improve the quality of life for our dogs. With its independent movement, ORo can wander around a room, toss a ball, and use AI through its camera and microphone to comprehend how a dog behaves. CEO Divye Bhotani highlights the need of working with animal behaviorists to make sure ORo interacts with dogs in particular, especially when they are left alone at home. With its $899 price tag and precise meal measurements in the food container, ORo is an alluring bundle for dog owners.\nInvoxia\u2019s Minitailz: A Smart Collar with Health Insights\nMinitailz, a smart pet collar with live GPS tracking and health insights for dogs, is brought to light by France-based Invoxia. Minitailz is a hardware and AI hybrid device that has sensors for Afib detection and heart health checks. This collar, which retails for $99 plus further monthly fees, promises to protect and maintain the health of our animal companions.\nOne by One\u2019s Melodic Solution: Streaming Music for Dogs\nOne by One, a Japanese business providing a streaming music service designed to calm dogs, is a great way to get started in the realm of dog entertainment. The $8 monthly service modifies tune and tempo according to the type of dog. One by One envisions expanding to other animal breeds, including animals on farms, and has ambitions to deploy smart speakers broadcasting this exclusive content. The company is also looking beyond dogs.\nBirdfy\u2019s Smart Bird Feeder: A Feast for Bird Enthusiasts\nWith its motion-activated smart outdoor bird feeder, China-based Birdfy steals the show. This gadget uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the species of birds in addition to taking close-up shots of wild birds consuming seeds. Birdfy, which costs $129, admits that AI classification is difficult, but it also promises constant updates to improve accuracy.\nconclusion\nTechnology isn\u2019t just about people, as CES 2024 shows; it can also improve the lives of our pets and the surrounding nature. These developments portend a time when smart technology coexists peacefully with our animal friends, giving them the attention, care, and entertainment they require. Get ready for the start of a brand-new pet technology era.\nRelated\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\nComment\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment."
