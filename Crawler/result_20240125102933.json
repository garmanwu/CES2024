        "raw_content": "NorthWestern Energy enters contracts for 325 megawatts of dispatchable capacity resources to serve Montana customers\nApril 20, 2021 20:00 ET\n| Source:\nNorthWestern Corporation\nNorthWestern Corporation\nBUTTE, Mont., April\n20, 2021\n(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NorthWestern Energy has entered into multiple contracts for projects to acquire 325 megawatts of dispatchable capacity resources: procurement and construction agreements for a 175 megawatt natural gas plant; a pending agreement to purchase capacity from a 50 megawatt battery storage project; and a power purchase agreement for 100 megawatts of predominantly hydroelectric resources.\nThe contracts were entered into after NorthWestern Energy completed its competitive solicitation process for long-term capacity resources issued in January 2020.\nThis will reduce NorthWestern Energy\u2019s capacity deficit, decrease risk associated with market volatility and potential lack of availability, and provide increased reliability for our Montana customers. The additional capacity to produce energy will address more than half of NorthWestern Energy\u2019s deficit in its supply portfolio serving Montana. The deficit is becoming more critical as some regional coal plants and other capacity resources are being shut down, compromising reliability during extreme weather conditions, including multi-day events, when energy demand is high.\nNorthWestern Energy\u2019s independent, third-party request for proposals evaluator, Aion Energy, received 180 proposals representing a wide variety of technologies from 21 bidders. NorthWestern Energy has selected three resources from the proposals submitted in response to the company\u2019s request for proposals:\n\u201cThis selection of diverse projects will provide critically needed flexible capacity from a combination of thermal and renewable resources,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy Vice President Supply and Montana Government Relations John Hines.\nThe selected resources provide diversity in ownership and technology, including owned and market-based resources and the largest battery-storage project within Montana.\n\u201cThis resource portfolio addresses a key portion of our immediate need for generation capacity while also allowing us to make progress toward our goal of an energy supply portfolio in Montana that reduces the carbon intensity of our electric generation by 90% by 2045,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy Chief Executive Officer Bob Rowe.\nNorthWestern Energy expects to submit an application for approval of the Laurel Generating Station and the 20-year contract for the pending Energy Storage Project to the Montana Public Service Commission on or about May 14, 2021. We anticipate the regulatory process to take approximately 9 months.\nThe $250 million Laurel Generating Station is expected to be available to serve customers by Jan. 3, 2024.\nFor the 175 megawatt natural gas-fired RICE plant near Laurel, Caterpillar Power Generation Systems, LLC, a subsidiary of Caterpillar, Inc. will supply the RICE units and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. was selected as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor. Burns & McDonnell has a solid reputation as a superior EPC contractor, particularly for RICE facilities.\nThe Caterpillar RICE units are highly reliable and efficient with low emissions. The selected engines are capable of rapid ramping and multiple daily starts and stops. These units have the flexibility to provide power on-demand, baseload power, flexible capacity, and regulation services. These characteristics will facilitate the integration of existing and new intermittent renewable energy resources into our portfolio.\nThe 50 megawatt battery energy storage system, is expected to be available to serve NorthWestern Energy\u2019s Montana customers by the end of 2023.\n\u201cThe energy storage project will provide the opportunity to store some excess energy from the grid to use when customer demand is high,\u201d NorthWestern Energy Director Long-Term Resources Bleau LaFave said. \u201cToday, NorthWestern Energy most frequently has excess energy on the grid from wind resources. Now we will have the opportunity to store a portion of that excess energy to improve matching the generation with customer demand and higher market pricing.\u201d\n\u201cThe five-year 100 megawatt power purchase agreement with Powerex, the marketing entity for BC Hydro, will provide our customers with capacity mainly from the BC Hydro system starting in Jan. 1, 2023\u201d said LaFave. \u201cOur Montana customers require this capacity as soon as it is available. This market product can be delivered on our existing transmission assets.\u201d\nNorthWestern Energy is still short of the capacity resources needed to produce energy reliably at the times when our Montana customers require it the most.\n\u201cThe 2020 RFP process provided an opportunity to see what projects and technology are available,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Bird. \u201cNorthWestern Energy\u2019s new Laurel Generating Station will be able to provide on-demand capacity for long durations. With that asset added to our Montana portfolio, NorthWestern Energy can consider other, shorter duration capacity projects in future RFPs.\u201d\n\u201cDeveloping a diverse portfolio of resources capable of producing the energy our Montana customers need any time they need it is the responsible path forward as we all work together toward an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy future,\u201d said Rowe.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter (@NWEinfo).\nAbout NorthWestern Energy (Nasdaq: NWE)NorthWestern provides electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 743,000 customers in Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska.
