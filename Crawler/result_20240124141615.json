        "raw_content": "CES 2024: The future is almost here for latest truck technology\nLAS VEGAS\u2014More trucks and trucking technology might be displayed here at the Consumer Electronic Show than ever before. While trucking is still a small subset of the thousands of exhibitors who\u2019ve descended upon this desert oasis, you can\u2019t miss the growing commercial vehicle presence here.\nWith a big focus on autonomous driving, Kodiak Robotics, Aurora Innovation, Torc Robotics, and Gatik AI all came to CES 2024, along with up to 300,000 attendees, to show off new developments and partnerships at the Las Vegas Convention Center and up and down the Vegas Strip.\nA lot of these companies\u2019 technologies appeared more theoretical years ago. But the future is almost here, according to the people behind some of the most innovative freight equipment ever seen.\nFleetOwner started covering CES in 2018 when Paccar debuted at what has become the largest annual technology gathering in North America. This year, the sprawling conference and exhibition is full of commercial vehicles of all sizes\u2014from startups to longstanding OEMs. Paccar\u2019s booth this year features its Peterbilt Super Truck II and its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck that is nearing production.\nSee also: Bosch doubles down on hydrogen as key to trucking\u2019s sustainable future\nNikola, the first company in the North American market with a Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck, is using CES to give consumers, analysts, and investors a chance to climb into the zero-emission cabover tractor for rides around the city.\nHere are some news, equipment, and technology that caught our eye during the first couple of days of CES 2024.\nKodiak says its tech is ready for driverless trucking\nKodiak Robotics used CES to show off its driverless-ready Class 8 truck, designed for scaled deployment beginning this year. The road-ready Kodiak truck has redundant safety-critical hardware the company said is needed to scale up commercial driverless operations.\nThe truck uses Kodiak\u2019s sixth generation of AV technology, developed over the past five years. During that time, Kodiak\u2019s real-world testing included 5,000 loads hauled more than 2.5 million miles on U.S. highways. This new truck technology will be used for Kodiak\u2019s driverless operations, which it plans to initiate between Dallas and Houston later this year.\nSee also: The humanless difference: Autonomous efficiency goes beyond fuel savings\nThe latest Kodiak truck includes redundancy across all safety-critical functions, including a redundant braking system, redundant steering, redundant power, and Kodiak\u2019s custom-designed high-integrity actuation control engine system.\nWhile some of its rivals are partnering with truck OEMs to develop autonomous driving, the Kodiak Driver is vehicle-agnostic and designed for upfitting. Kodiak plans to roll out its sixth-generation truck to multiple vehicle types.\nThe latest Kodiak truck features twice the GPU processor cores, 1.6x greater processing speed, 3x more memory, and 2.75x greater bandwidth to run software processes than Kodiak\u2019s first-generation truck. With this launch, Kodiak\u2019s driverless truck design is now feature-complete across both hardware and software, according to company leaders.\nAurora turns to Continental for AV system production\nContinental and Aurora Innovation showed off this Peterbilt 579 equipped with Aurora\u2019s self-driving truck technology. The companies recently finalized the design and architecture of the future fallback system and hardware of the Aurora Driver, a Level 4 autonomous driving system that Continental plans to start producing in 2027. The finalized hardware design comes less than a year after the companies began their partnership to develop high-volume manufacturing of autonomous trucking systems.\nAurora is also working with Continental\u2019s engineering team to update its industrialized fallback system for 2027 production. Autonomous vehicles need built-in redundancies that provide backups in the rare case a component or sensor fails. One of these redundancies is the fallback system, a specialized secondary computer that can take over operation if a failure occurs in the primary system. This dual engineering approach aims to reduce the exposure of the primary and fallback system to single points of failure.\n\u201cFrom day one, we knew we\u2019d need to build a strong ecosystem of partners to bring this technology to market safely and at a commercial scale,\u201d said Chris Urmson, co-founder and CEO at Aurora. \u201cFinalizing the design of our future hardware is a meaningful step toward making the unit economics of the Aurora Driver compelling and building a business for the long term.\u201d\nDaimler Truck\u2019s Torc teams with Aeva on lidar\nTorc Robotics\u2019 next generation of ultra-long range lidar will come from Aeva, a sensing and perception systems provider, the Daimler Truck subsidiary announced during CES this week.\nUnder the production collaboration, Aeva will supply its latest Aeva Atlas automotive-grade 4D lidar technology to Daimler Truck and collaborate with Torc Robotics on its Level 4 autonomous Freightliner Cascadia truck platform, which it plans to commercialize by 2027. Daimler Truck intends to integrate the lidar sensors directly into its production process, allowing customers to spec out the AV technology directly from the OEM.\nTorc plans to offer its virtual driver technology and its supporting \u201cmission control\u201d services as a subscription service. Its driving software will use Aeva\u2019s perception software, built around Aeva\u2019s instant velocity data, to detect objects faster, further away, and with higher accuracy. The multi-year collaboration begins in the first quarter of 2024, with Aeva\u2019s start of production by 2026 and Daimler Truck production ramp by 2027.\nGatik ups AV tire intelligence with Goodyear\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and Gatik AI, the autonomous middle-mile B2B logistics company, are expanding tire intelligence technology integration into an autonomous driving system.\nGatik\u2019s autonomous fleet of Class 3 to Class 7 box trucks operates on public streets in the U.S. and Canada, transferring goods for grocery and other retailers. The fleet will be equipped with Goodyear Endurance RSA tires with\u00a0Goodyear SightLine technology, the rubber company\u2019s tire intelligence solution. Company leaders said this enables Gatik to advance its fleet operations\u2019 safety and accuracy while improving delivery uptime and reliability. This year, Gatik plans to implement the intelligent tire solution into a significant portion of its autonomous fleet in North America.\n\u201cBeing the vehicle\u2019s only contact point to the road, the tire can play a pivotal role in enabling the vehicle to react like a driver would,\u201d said Chris Helsel, Goodyear SVP of global operations and chief technology officer. \u201cGatik is revolutionizing the autonomous technology space, and by providing real-time insights through intelligent tire data, we can support Gatik\u2019s autonomous driving system to become even more safe, reliable, and efficient.\u201d\nNikola\u2019s Tre fuel cell truck draws consumer attention\nNikola Corporation is using CES to show off its hydrogen fuel-cell electric Class 8 truck, which is powered by a Bosch fuel cell. The company sold 35 of the zero-emission trucks in 2023 and produced more than 40 as it continues to ramp up production here in the U.S.\nTre ride-along trips around Las Vegas this week drew a lot of attention. The company is also promoting its emerging hydrogen potential fuel energy supply infrastructure through its\u00a0HYLA brand.\nNikola\u2019s FCEV features a range of up to 500 miles and a 20-minute estimated fueling time. The OEM is initially eyeing fleet customers in drayage and intermodal operations to regional truckload and less-than-truckload, along with specialized hauling use cases.\nPeterbilt shares Super Truck II successes\nThe Peterbilt SuperTruck II was a prominent feature of Paccar\u2019s CES 2024 exhibition booth, which also featured its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell tractor. First unveiled in 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy project to improve long-haul Class 8 vehicle freight ton efficiency by at least 100% exceeded those goals, according to the OEM, which reached 132%.\nThe sleek Peterbilt SuperTruck II features an aerodynamic shape with a center drive position that improves overall visibility, a right-hand entry stand-up door, pop-out windows, cameras in place of mirrors, and custom tires and wheels.\nThe program focused on advanced and highly efficient powertrain systems and vehicle technologies to meet progressive emissions standards and Class 8 tractor-trailer vehicle safety and regulatory requirements that influence freight efficiency.\nOther Peterbilt SuperTruck II features included a mild hybrid powertrain, a waste heat recovery system, and a lightweight chassis for improved fuel economy. The split-level integral cab and sleeper features a large, wrap-around dash, 15-inch digital dash display for virtual gauges and critical vehicle data, an additional display for HVAC, infotainment and navigation controls, an articulated seat that rotates left and right, and a pull-out desk.\nOttonomy aims to expand last-mile robot fleet\nFirst- and last-mile delivery startup Ottonomy plans to grow its fleet of 50 Ottobot autonomous robots into the hundreds as it expands its hyperlocal delivery network here in the U.S. and Europe on college campuses, airports, and urban sidewalks.\nThe U.S.-based company announced a strategic partnership with Harbor Lockers and introduced its customized locker-on-robot, Ottobot Locker, here at CES 2024.\nOttobot Locker will support robot delivery options to Harbor Locker locations to streamline customer services for pickup, dropoff, and delivery. In addition, Ottonomy has partnered with Cooler Keg to introduce Ottobot Brew at CES, which would turn the delivery robots into on-demand deliverers of cold brew coffee and beer within geofenced areas.\nOttonomy\u2019s Level 4 autonomous technology is customized for the development of Ottobot Locker in its partnership with Harbor Lockers, on display at both companies\u2019 CES booths. Ottobot Locker runs on the Harbor Locker\u2019s app ecosystem and brings a revolutionary dimension to fixed smart lockers by adding mobility for first- and last-mile delivery.\nIndigo Technologies\u2019 SmartWheels cargo EVs near Lordstown production\nIndigo Technologies has two light-duty electric cargo vans that it intends to produce at Foxconn\u2019s Lordstown, Ohio, production plant. Hon Hai Technology Group, known as Foxconn in the U.S., invested in the EV startup late last year.\nIndigo\u2019s technologies include what it said is the world\u2019s first road-sensing SmartWheels, designed to make light-efficient EVs feel smooth and stable with more cargo space because of redesigned vehicle architecture. According to the company, the SmartWheels motors fit into each wheel to free up more cabin space while providing two degrees of freedom controlled by software.\nThe Indigo Dash Cargo van, designed for grocery, food, and package delivery, features 90 cubic feet of cargo space, offers Level 2 and fast recharging of its 30 kWh battery, and a 143-mile range.\nThe Indigo Flow Cargo is one of two Indigo Technologies last-mile electric delivery vans it plans to begin producing later this year.\nMullen showcases light and medium EV trucks\nSouthern California-based electric vehicle startup Mullen is making its CES debut this year with a display that includes its line of commercial EVs. The manufacturer showed off its Bollinger-branded Class 4 chassis cab and box truck.\nMullen acquired Bollinger Motors in 2022, which put the EV maker in the medium-duty truck space. Bollinger also displayed its electric SUV and pickup models here in Las Vegas. It also featured some of its light-duty EV offerings, including the Mullen One, a Class 1 EV cargo van, and the Mullen Three, a Class 3 cabover EV that can be upfitted as a box truck or service truck.\nLuminar shows off Plus\u2019 super driver assist\nAdvanced driver assistance autonomous provider Plus was part of the Luminar booth outside the Las Vegas Convention Center during CES. The Plus system, which uses Luminar\u2019s Iris lidar system, is a Level 2++ autonomous system designed to ease professional driving tasks with features such as Traffic Jam Assist, merge assistance, collision avoidance, and more.\nAAM showcases e-Beam axles\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing features its next generation of front and rear e-Beam axles, integrating AAM\u2019s e-Drive technology here at CES 2024. This battery-electric, light-duty truck features AAM\u2019s 3-in-1 high-speed electric drive units.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "The Robot Report\nTop 10 robots seen at CES 2024\nBy Mike Oitzman | January 13, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 CES 2024 featured a wide range of emerging technologies, from fitness devices and videogames to autonomous vehicles. But robots always have a significant presence in the sprawling exhibit halls.\nThe Robot Report visited numerous booths in the Eureka Park section of CES, as well as in the other focused sections of the event. Here are some highlights from this week\u2019s event:\nMobinn climbs stairway toward success\nMobinn is a Korean startup focused on last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles. While the concept of last-mile delivery isn\u2019t new, Mobinn demonstrated an innovative wheeled robot that can climb stairs.\nThe robot is capable of going up and down stairs through the implementation of compliant wheels. A self-leveling box on top of the robot keeps the cargo level, so your drinks and food don\u2019t spill out of their containers.\nGlidance guides people with vision impairments\nThe latest prototype of the Glidance device is fully functional for public demos and includes a camera in the handle and radar sensors in the base. | Credit: The Robot Report\nRoboBusiness PitchFire 2023 winner Glidance also won a CES 2024 Innovation Award and showed the latest functional prototype of its Glide device in its booth. The robotic Glide guides sight-impaired individuals similar to a guide dog.\nThe startup is designing Glide to be affordable and easy to learn how to use when it starts shipping later this year. I tried Glide firsthand (while closing my eyes). The experience was incredible, and I can only imagine how promising this technology would be for an individual with sight loss.\nThe team at Glidance mentioned to me that celebrity Stevie Wonder came to the Glidance booth for a demo of the product during CES.\nUnitree H1 humanoid steals the show\nThere were two full-size humanoid robots at CES 2024.\nKepler Robotics had a stationary model of the new Kepler Forerunner K1 in its Eureka Park booth. The robot includes 14 linear-axis motors and 14 rotary-axis motors. Unfortunately, the company was unable to give live demos of the Forerunner.\nThe Unitree H1 humanoid robot uses sensors in its \u201chead\u201d to perceive the world around the robot as it navigates and avoids obstacles. | Credit: The Robot Report\nThe internet influencer darling of CES has to be the Unitree H1 humanoid, and the company was giving nearly continuous live demos of the H1 at its booth.\nKudos to the Unitree marketing team for its now-infamous \u201ckick the robot\u201d videos that have been shared on social media over the past six months. In the videos, H1 appears to be a solid humanoid platform with respectable balance and agility.\nHowever, as a longtime robotics industry insider and experienced robotics applications engineer, I thought the Unitree H1 product demos at CES 2024 were cringe-worthy, as the Unitree demo team walked the H1 robot into crowds of \u201cinternet tech influencers\u201d with their cameras ablaze.\nThe 150 lb. (68 kg) robot danced with the public inches away. A single tripping incident would have sent the robot tumbling into an innocent bystander and made instant headlines. It would have been a public relations disaster and a setback for the industry.\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that the H1 was a crowd favorite at CES 2024, and the company and its robot received a lot of news media attention.\nHyundai displays future mobility tech at CES 2024\nHyundai PnD Module concept\nThe company had multiple large-scale booths showing autonomy concepts for the future, including autonomous mobility for both humans and freight, as well as a look at the future of autonomous construction vehicles. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to witness either of the live mobility demonstrations, but the Hyundai Construction Xite concept tractor was an impressive incarnation of autonomous construction designs.\nHyundai presented a concept for the future of autonomous construction equipment with the display of the Construction Xite tractor (Editors note: for scale, the bucket arm is over 10 ft tall). | Credit: The Robot Report\nAV24 rolls into the showroom\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) had an impressive booth in the automotive hall of CES 2024, surrounded by well-known brand names. On display was a fully functional version of the newest AV24 autonomous racecar, showing off the integration of an entirely new autonomy stack in the vehicle.\nThe IAC has partnered with many of the leading automotive technology companies to embed the latest lidar, radar, vision, and GPS sensors within the vehicle.\ndSpace announced an extended partnership with IAC that will deliver digital twins of each university team\u2019s vehicle along with digital twins of each of the race tracks. In turn, these will enable the teams to train the AI drivers completely in simulation and then port the AI models and drive code directly the physical race cars.\nIn addition, some sanctioned sim races are possible later this year, said the IAC organizers.\nEmbodied AI displays updated Moxie\nThe latest generation of Moxie by Embodied AI was on display in Amazon\u2019s booth at CES. Embodied recently announced new tutoring functionality with the latest software release for Moxie, and it demonstrated the software at the expo.\nAmazon had a separate expo suite that featured all of the physical Amazon consumer and smart home products (Amazon Astro was noticeably absent from the display). Moxie entertained the gathered crowds as it demonstrated its interactivity.\nFingervision measures gripper force\nMy \u201cUnknown Discovery\u201d award of CES 2024 goes to a young Japanese startup called Fingervision. This was a serendipitous discovery of an innovation that uses tiny cameras built into the gripper fingers of an industrial robot,\nThey provide feedback on the grip force and \u201cslippage\u201d of an item held with the gripper. This is accomplished by imaging the area where the fingers touch an object through an opaque surface. Thus the origin of the company name.\nThe company has deployed its first grippers into an application where robots are picking up fried chicken nuggets and packaging them.\nHonorable mentions from CES 2024\nGatik keeps on trucking \u2014 autonomously\nGatik showed the third generation of its on-road autonomous truck. The company has made its mark on autonomous logistics through the deployment of driving algorithms that plans paths so that the vehicle only makes right-hand turns, avoiding more complex and dangerous left-hand turns.\nGatik first demonstrated fully driverless, freight-only commercial deliveries on the middle mile with Walmart in 2021. Shortly after, it\u00a0executed the first fully driverless deployment for Canada\u2019s largest retailer, Loblaw.\nThe company also announced a partnership with Goodyear tires to develop \u201cSmart Tires\u201d that can provide real-time feedback to the autonomous driver with data about the condition of the tires to help maintain traction and control.\nBobcat Rogue X2 gets ready to move the earth\nAt CES 2024, Bobcat showed off an autonomous concept prototype, the Bobcat Rogue X2, at CES 2024. The all-electric, autonomous robot is designed for handling material movement and ground-altering operations at construction, mining, and agriculture sites.\nThe design prototype of the Rogue X2 at CES had wheels rather than tracks, but manually driven Bobcats can be equipped with tracks, so a production version of the Rogue could have similar configurations.\nOttonomy IO partners with Harbor Lockers\nThrough a new partnership with Harbor Lockers, the latest generation of Ottobot can now be configured with a payload of Harbor Lockers. This includes the Harbor Locker physical locker infrastructure, as well as the Harbor Locker application interface.\nThis is the first time that Ottonomy is partnering with a third-party vendor to extend the autonomous last-mile delivery solution.\nLawn-mowing robots arrive in North America\nCES is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics shows. While The Robot\u00a0Report doesn\u2019t typically cover consumer robotics, it is notable that lawn-mowing robotics were ubiquitous at CES this year, with a dozen vendors showing their autonomous systems.\nThe European market for consumer lawnmowers is already mature, but the North American market is in the early stages of adoption. Without testing all of the different lawnmowing robots, it\u2019s difficult to determine the market leaders, but the two most promising solutions that I saw at the show included the new Yarbo Lawn Mower and the latest generation of Navimow from Segway Robotics.\nmowers-navimow\nMike Oitzman is Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the Mobile Robot Guide. Oitzman is a robotics industry veteran with 25-plus years of experience at various high-tech companies in the roles of marketing, sales and product management.

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "ESPN\nAs the Washington Football Team's QB quest enters Year 29, ESPN Analytics ranks its past 30 starters\nASHBURN, Va. -- On Sunday, Ryan Fitzpatrick became the Washington Football Team's 31st starting quarterback since Mark Rypien left the lineup in Week 2 of the 1993 season.\nFitzpatrick left Washington's 20-16 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers with a hip injury after attempting six passes and was placed on injured reserve with a chance to return later this season. Backup Taylor Heinicke was named the starter for Thursday's game against the visiting New York Giants (8:20 p.m. ET, NFL Network), a situation that is emblematic of the franchise's quest for a long-term answer at the position.\nIt's a 29-year search that has featured bad timing, worse luck and questionable decisions.\nRypien, who led the team to victory in Super Bowl XXVI after the 1991 season, started 26 games over the next two years but never rekindled his winning magic. Washington has since used first-round draft picks on five quarterbacks (Heath Shuler, Patrick Ramsey, Jason Campbell, Robert Griffin III and Dwayne Haskins), acquired three who started in Super Bowls for other teams (Jeff Hostetler, Donovan McNabb and Rex Grossman), and watched two others (Brad Johnson and Rich Gannon) do so after leaving the team. It also had a transformative quarterback (Griffin) who starred as a rookie, got hurt and was gone from the franchise three years later.\nEditor's Picks\nTaylor Heinicke is a 'tough dude' who energizes Washington Football Team2yJohn Keim\nFantasy fallout: Deebo Samuel is for real; Elijah Mitchell is 'for now'2yMike Triplett\nWhy the New York Giants remain all-in on Daniel Jones as QB12yJordan Raanan\nAs Washington closes on the 30th anniversary of its last Super Bowl win, ESPN set out to rank the 30 quarterbacks who started for the franchise between Rypien and Fitzpatrick, to provide context about the search for a leader that has touched four decades.\nAs a reporter who has covered 28 of the 30 players on this list -- and after interviewing nearly two dozen people, including former Washington coaches and teammates -- arriving at an irrefutable ranking for me was challenging. Several of these quarterbacks barely touched the field with Washington, while others faced obstacles such as coaching staffs that didn't want them, schemes that didn't fit their talents or injuries.\nWe enlisted the help of ESPN Analytics to apply a sense of order. That ranking (explained below) isn't perfect, but it does highlight the volatility of Washington's quest.\nNo quarterback since Rypien has made more than 60 starts for this franchise. Only two -- Kirk Cousins and Jason Campbell -- topped 50 starts, and 12 made five or fewer. Heck, receiver Terry McLaurin has played 30 games in Washington and caught passes from seven quarterbacks.\nMORE: A timeline of Washington Football Team's controversy and comebacks\nDuring Washington's search, its NFC East rivals have enjoyed long stretches of stability at the position. The Dallas Cowboys have had three quarterbacks (Troy Aikman, Tony Romo and Dak Prescott) start at least 70 games; Eli Manning started 234 for the New York Giants; and from 2000 to 2012, the Philadelphia Eagles had Donovan McNabb (10 seasons) and Michael Vick (three seasons) combine for 172 starts over that span.\nThe turnover has hurt the quality of QB play for Washington, which has had two postseason wins since Rypien's last full season in 1992. Nobody knew the frustration better than right tackle Jon Jansen, who played with 10 starting quarterbacks from 1999 to 2008.\n\"[When there's] constant change at quarterback,\" Jansen said, \"you don't ever get a chance to develop a rhythm and develop the relationship you need on the field.\"\nHere is our analytics-based ranking, presented in order from the back of the pack at No. 30 to the best at No. 1. Included are thoughts from ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. on the five QBs who were first-round draft picks by Washington.\nNote: ESPN Analytics ranked the QBs according to a combination of regular-season passing efficiency (yards per attempt), weighted 75%, and total passing yards, weighted 25%. Players with few appearances (fewer than 1,000 passing yards) were ranked below those with more significant appearances and sorted solely by total passing yards. To account for the changing nature of the NFL's passing game, yardage and efficiency were adjusted according to the years in which they occurred.\n* Games and record totals include playoff appearances with Washington.\n30. Mark Sanchez (2018)\nGames: 2 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 0 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 138\nWithin two weeks of signing, he became the starter after Colt McCoy was injured. Sanchez's lone start was disastrous: He completed 6 of 14 passes for 38 yards and two interceptions. He was benched for the second half and never played in the NFL again.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 28 but acknowledge that his one half was one of the worst in recent memory.\n29. Taylor Heinicke (2020-present)*\nGames: 3 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 259\nOn Dec. 7, he was a student at Old Dominion taking math classes. A day later he signed with Washington, and a month later he started a playoff game against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Heinicke entered the 2021 season as Fitzpatrick's backup, with a multiyear contract and strong fan support. He has an opportunity to climb this list, starting Thursday.\nKeim's take: There's no doubt he belongs higher, but this is indicative of how few snaps he has taken in Washington.\n28. Cary Conklin (1990-93)\nGames: 5 | Record: 0-2 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 512\nConklin, a fourth-round draft pick in 1990, appeared in seven NFL games, including two with the San Francisco 49ers. His lone starts occurred during Washington's 1993 season, when it finished 4-12.\nKeim's take: I'm fine with him here.\n27. Josh Johnson (2018)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 590\nBecause of multiple injuries, Johnson made his first start 11 days after signing in December 2018. Said former coach Jay Gruden: \"We knew he could run. He wasn't the greatest passer, but he had a skill the other guys didn't have. [Mark] Sanchez had more experience but couldn't move.\"\nJohnson learned his Washington teammates by playing the Madden video game after signing.\nKeim's take: Too low for me; I would have put him at No. 21.\n26. Kyle Allen (2020-present)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 4 | INTs: 1 | Pass yards: 610\nIn his four starts, he posted a Total QBR of 70 or better three times. Washington had only one other quarterback (Alex Smith) post a 70 rating or better in 2020. A broken ankle ended Allen's season.\nKeim's take: He was better than a few players ahead of him, which is why I would have ranked him No. 19.\n25. Rich Gannon (1993)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 704\nGannon wasn't healthy in Washington.\n\"I told him, 'I could sit flat-footed and throw the ball farther than you,'\" said former running back Brian Mitchell, who played quarterback in college. \"When he played here, he did not have the same arm he did when he was in Oakland. It was nowhere close.\"\nHere's why: Gannon needed shoulder surgery and missed all of 1994. From 1999 to 2002, he led the Raiders to a Super Bowl, was named NFL MVP once, earned All-Pro twice and threw 105 touchdowns to 44 interceptions.\nKeim's take: Close; I would have ranked him No. 24, so there's agreement on his lack of effectiveness with Washington.\n24. Danny Wuerffel (2002)\nGames: 7 | Record: 2-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 719\nThe beginning of the end for coach Steve Spurrier in Washington occurred when the front office, against his strong wishes, cut Wuerffel before the 2003 season. Spurrier was shown statistics the night before cuts to convince him it was the right move. Wuerffel never played again.\nKeim's take: He just didn't have the arm to play in the NFL.\n23. John Beck (2011)\nGames: 4 | Record: 0-3 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 858\nFormer coach Mike Shanahan once said he would stand on a table to advocate for Beck. Players would not. During the 2011 lockout, Beck organized workouts.\nMore Than An Athlete: Michael Strahan\nFrom modest beginnings abroad, to NFL football superstardom, to media mogul, explore how Michael Strahan redefined the possibilities for modern athletes. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid former Washington tight end Chris Cooley: \"What I remember is he called everyone and said, 'This is John Beck, your starting quarterback.' We all called each other and said, 'Is he the starting QB or just saying that?' I didn't hate the confidence.\"\nBut it didn't translate to games. His last two starts were disasters: He was sacked 10 times in a shutout loss against the Buffalo Bills because he wouldn't throw the ball.\n\"He panicked,\" Cooley said.\nThe next week he dumped the ball off to running back Roy Helu 14 times and averaged 5.4 yards per pass attempt. In those games, Beck posted Total QBRs of 11.3 and 25.8, respectively.\n\"He thought he was going to be the guy,\" former receiver Santana Moss said. \"He sucked ass; I won't lie to you. I broke my hand and didn't play the [final two] games with him. Nothing better could have happened to me, because I didn't have to play with this guy. ... You talk all this stuff in the offseason and lay this egg.\"\nBeck never played again but has transformed himself into a quarterback teacher, training players for the NFL.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 30 based on the eye test and also with input from a number of ex-players.\n22. Jeff Hostetler (1997)\nGames: 6 | Record: 2-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 899\nThe former Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants finished his 12-year career by starting the last three games of 1997. His lone defeat was a crushing four-interception, 30-10 loss to the Giants in Week 16.\nKeim's take: This is the right area for him.\n21. Shane Matthews (2002)\nGames: 8 | Record: 3-4 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 1,251\nOne week after scoring 14 points in a win, Spurrier was determined to prove the value of his passing game. In a return to Florida for Spurrier and Matthews, facing the Jacksonville Jaguars' No. 21-ranked run defense and No. 13 pass defense, Matthews threw 50 passes and Washington lost by 19. In seven starts, he completed under half of his throws four times.\nKeim's take: Like Hostetler, Matthews is ranked where he needs to be.\n20. Tim Hasselbeck (2003-04)\nGames: 7 | Record: 1-4 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,012\nHe recorded the only 0.0 passer rating in franchise history, completing 6 of 26 passes for 56 yards with four interceptions in a 27-0 loss to Dallas. But that was sandwiched between games in which he had ratings of 128 and 116.9.\nKeim's take: That 0.0 game stands out, which is why some pegged him last. For me, he would be ranked No. 29.\n19. Dwayne Haskins (2019-20)\nGames: 16 | Record: 3-10 | TDs: 12 | INTs: 14 | Pass yards: 2,804\nWashington had him rated as a third-round draft pick in 2019, but multiple sources said higher-ups made them give Haskins a first-round grade and the team drafted him No. 15 overall. It was a bad marriage: Washington's staff needed to win, but Haskins needed time to mature.\nHis game didn't improve, and his maturity level was an issue for two coaching staffs and the front office. He missed one victory formation snap because he was taking a picture with a fan; he didn't study the way the coaches wanted; he was fined multiple times in 2020 for violating COVID-19 protocols, stripped of his captaincy and eventually cut.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 25, but some of that ranking stems from the disappointing way he approached being an NFL quarterback.\nKiper's take on Haskins (2019 first-round draft pick, No. 15 overall): He's a pocket guy, big strong-armed guy. It made sense: local guy sliding down. He fell in their lap. It's like Mac Jones falling in New England's lap or Aaron Rodgers falling into Green Bay's lap. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\nI don't think you can look back and say it was a horrible pick. In hindsight, yeah, but not when it was made. There were always questions with Dwayne: Are you going to be the first one in the building, the last one out? How much does he love the game? Does he study the game? What kind of leader is he? How do his teammates feel about him?\n18. Alex Smith (2018-20)\nGames: 18 | Record: 11-5 | TDs: 16 | INTs: 13 | Pass yards: 3,762\nThe key stat: During his time in Washington, the team was 6-27 when he didn't start. Washington was 6-3 when he suffered his broken fibula and tibia in 2018, then lost 18 of the next 22 games.\n\"Take any franchise and take away Derek Carr, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and see what happens to them,\" Gruden said of losing Smith. \"Not many teams can recover.\"\nSmith's improbable return in 2020 helped deliver an NFC East title as the team went 5-1 in games he started (and 2-8 when he didn't).\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him in the top five. He and Mark Brunell were similar, so this is way too low for Smith.\n17. Heath Shuler (1994-96)\nGames: 19 | Record: 4-9 | TDs: 13 | INTs: 19 | Pass yards: 2,403\nWashington selected him at No. 3 in 1994 instead of Trent Dilfer (No. 6 overall) because of his mobility, even though it had Dilfer rated higher. Shuler's new teammates were not impressed.\nEli's Places\nEli Manning takes on his own version of his brother's signature show to explore what makes college football a way of life across the country. Join Eli as he travels to some of the most well-known and historic college football establishments and meets with giants in the sport to better understand what makes college football such a national sensation. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid Mitchell: \"We played a game in Kansas City [in 1995], and we called a waggle pass. He called it the wrong way, and it got f---ed up in the backfield. I was asked by a coach why I didn't help him out, and I said, 'If you want to pay me quarterback money, I'll call plays and play quarterback.'\"\nAfter the 1996 season, the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints called about a trade. The Packers were coached by Mike Holmgren, and Washington's front office told Shuler it would be a better fit: He could learn and rebuild his game. Shuler wanted to play immediately and chose the Saints and coach Mike Ditka. He started nine games, suffered a serious foot injury and never played again.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 15, but this ranking by ESPN Analytics probably better reflects his performance. However, he should never be ahead of Smith.\nKiper's take on Shuler (1994 first-round draft pick, No. 3 overall): Second-guessing the Heath pick? You can't do it now. I got it wrong. I had no problem with Washington taking him at that point. If I was the Colts [at No. 5], I would have taken Trent Dilfer. Trent turned out to be a lot better than Heath, but I don't think you can question that pick.\n16. Case Keenum (2019)\nGames: 10 | Record: 1-7 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 5 | Pass yards: 1,707\nHe ended up starting in 2019 because McCoy was hurt and Haskins wasn't ready. He's a quality NFL backup with 75 career touchdown passes to 47 interceptions.\nKeim's take: No problem with this ranking of Keenum.\n15. Tony Banks (2001)\nGames: 15 | Record: 8-6 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 2,386\nHe became the surprise starter when Jeff George was waived after two games in 2001. Banks helped turn an 0-5 start into an 8-8 finish under coach Marty Schottenheimer. He played three more seasons with the Houston Texans, starting three games.\nKeim's take: Like Allen, he was better than several players ranked above him here, which is why I would have ranked him ninth.\n14. Jeff George (2000-01)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 7 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,557\nWashington signed George despite a stellar 1999 season by Brad Johnson. George's name had come up the previous offseason, but one source said it was a unanimous \"no.\" The only change in 2000 was the new owner, Dan Snyder; George was signed. In 2000, coach Norv Turner resisted pressure to play George until Johnson was hurt.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him about No. 20 because he just wasn't good with Washington.\n13. Rex Grossman (2010-12)\nGames: 17 | Record: 6-10 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 24 | Pass yards: 4,035\nAfter being benched in 2011, Grossman tried to limit risky throws. But he said he told himself, in essence, this is just who I am, so the \"gutsy\" throws returned.\n\"I really enjoyed Rex, but he could keep both teams in the game,\" Mike Shanahan said. \"He could win a game; he also could lose a game.\"\nKeim's take: Anywhere from No. 10 to No. 13 is good for Grossman.\n12. Mark Brunell (2004-06)*\nGames: 37 | Record: 16-19 | TDs: 38 | INTs: 20 | Pass yards: 6,033\nWashington traded a third-round pick for the 33-year-old Brunell in coach Joe Gibbs' first season back. Brunell wasn't flashy, but in 2005 he helped lead the team to a playoff berth -- and its last postseason win. A highlight: two touchdown passes in the final four minutes to Moss in a 14-13 Monday night win in Dallas.\n\"I liked Mark Brunell,\" Moss said. \"He had that veteran sense; he knew how to win.\"\nKeim's take: No. I would have ranked him at least No. 6, and I could be persuaded into putting him one or two spots higher. Strong leader, overcame an inefficient scheme.\n11. John Friesz (1994)\nGames: 16 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,266\nHe served as the bridge QB to Shuler and Frerotte. It took four games to cross that bridge, and Friesz never started again in Washington, though he did play six more NFL seasons.\nKeim's take: No. 11 is a little high for Friesz, but only by perhaps three spots. He liked to push it down the field and averaged 7.0 yards per pass attempt.\n10. Trent Green (1995-98)\nGames: 16 | Record: 6-8 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 11 | Pass yards: 3,441\nGreen, cut in the CFL in 1994, finally got his chance in 1998 and won six of his last nine starts. But he was a free agent and, because Washington's franchise was for sale, the trustees would not let the team give signing bonuses.\nNFL PrimeTime on ESPN+\nChris Berman and Booger McFarland recap the weekend's games with extended highlights and analysis.\nThe show will stream live at 7:30 p.m. ET each Sunday during the season and will be available on demand each week until late Wednesday night. Watch on ESPN+\nFinally, on the eve of free agency, Washington received permission to make an offer. Too late; Green had already agreed to a deal with St. Louis.\n\"Trent was better than any f---ing quarterback we had here,\" said Mitchell, who played with Washington from 1990 to 1999. \"He might have been the best quarterback we've had in this franchise as far as overall ability since Mark Rypien.\"\nKeim's take: I would have moved him five spots higher and would be OK with him anywhere in the top eight, but he shouldn't be behind the five quarterbacks immediately ahead of him on this list. Never.\n9. Todd Collins (2006-09)*\nGames: 9 | Record: 3-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 1,032\nAfter safety Sean Taylor died in 2007, Washington won its last four games -- including all of Collins' starts in place of the injured Jason Campbell. Collins had not started a game in 10 years, throwing 27 passes during that span, but was well-versed in coordinator Al Saunders' system after spending five years with him in Kansas City.\nKeim's take: I would have pushed him a few spots lower, but you can't understate the impact he had during that late stretch run.\n8. Patrick Ramsey (2002-05)\nGames: 33 | Record: 10-14 | TDs: 34 | INTs: 29 | Pass yards: 5,649\nWashington traded back twice in the first round and drafted Ramsey with the No. 32 pick in 2002 despite Spurrier saying he had never met with him. At the time, one source said the coaching staff and front office did not tell Snyder the QB they were targeting, fearing he would leak it to the media.\nIn his first two starts, blitzed often, Ramsey was sacked 13 times and hit countless others as the offense rarely used max protection.\n\"Those quarterbacks were done a disservice,\" Jansen said.\nKeim's take: He should not be in the top 10, but somewhere around No. 12 makes sense.\nKiper's take on Ramsey (2002 first-round draft pick, No. 32 overall): His biggest issue was he didn't have mobility. He was like a 4.99, 5.0-flat guy [in the 40-yard dash]. He was a decent athlete, but that puts a lot of pressure on the [offensive] line. ... Tough, smart kid, and in the right system, I thought he could flourish.\"\n7. Colt McCoy (2014-19)\nGames: 12 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 8 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,679\nInjuries always derailed McCoy's opportunities. He had the job at the end of 2014 before injuring his neck. He got another chance after Smith's injury in 2018 but broke his right leg in his second start, leading to multiple issues and still impacting him in 2019, when he started just one game.\nKeim's take: McCoy is a smart player but was hurt too often and didn't win when he played, so No. 7 is way too high. He belongs somewhere in the middle at best, and others would argue lower.\n6. Donovan McNabb (2010)\nGames: 13 | Record: 5-8 | TDs: 14 | INTs: 15 | Pass yards: 3,377\nThe coaches wanted Marc Bulger but ended up with McNabb after an Easter Sunday trade in 2010. It did not work out. McNabb was removed late in one game -- for conditioning -- and was benched for the final three games. McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan engaged in a public spat. Perhaps the low point: On Nov. 15, Washington gave McNabb a mostly hollow five-year extension worth nearly $80 million. There was a news conference before a Monday night game against his old team, the Eagles. That night, Eagles QB Michael Vick threw four touchdown passes and rushed for two more in a 59-28 win.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 11, but I get it: McNabb averaged 7.2 yards per attempt, which was better than Brunell (6.3) and Smith (6.5) in Washington.\n5. Jason Campbell (2005-09)\nGames: 52 | Record: 20-32 | TDs: 55 | INTs: 38 | Pass yards: 10,860\nHe was drafted No. 25 in 2005, one pick after Aaron Rodgers, to throw deep balls on play-action passes under Gibbs. They liked Campbell more than Rodgers, but a year later Gibbs hired Saunders, who did not run the same system. In Washington, Campbell played for two head coaches and three offensive coordinators after having four offensive coordinators at Auburn.\nKeim's take: Too high; he's more in the No. 8-9 range. Others were more effective -- namely Brunell and Smith -- but few were hurt more than Campbell by the constant changing of coaches and coordinators.\nKiper's take on Campbell (2005 first-round draft pick, No. 25 overall): I had Campbell with the same grade as my [players ranked from No. 42 to No. 52]. Having Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown [at running back] aided his cause [at Auburn]. He [was] big, athletic. But my concern was he put it all together for just one season, with the vital improvement being seen in his touchdown-to-interception ratio (20 TDs, 7 INTs in his final college season). That's why to me he was viewed as a borderline first- to third-round choice. That's why my thing was, go up and get Rodgers. He was my seventh-best player. [But] Rodgers in Washington might have been a bust. He sat three full years behind Brett Favre [in Green Bay], and they reconstructed his delivery.\n4. Gus Frerotte (1994-98)\nGames: 52 | Record: 19-26-1 | TDs: 48 | INTs: 44 | Pass yards: 9,769\nWashington had a middle-rounds grade on Frerotte, so it gladly drafted him in the seventh round in 1994 -- after taking Shuler in the first. Frerotte made the Pro Bowl in 1996, albeit with 12 TD passes and 11 interceptions, and played 15 NFL seasons. He's best remembered for head-butting the wall at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium after scoring in a 1997 game against the Giants that finished 7-7.\n\"I never get upset about it. Obviously if I could redo it I would, but I did it,\" Frerotte said of the head-butt. \"Like I tell my kids, I'll be on ESPN forever.\"\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him seventh, but spots No. 4 to No. 7 were difficult to rank because each offered something of value. Others on the list had more impact on winning games.\n3. Robert Griffin III (2012-15)*\nGames: 38 | Record: 14-22 | TDs: 40 | INTs: 23 | Pass yards: 8,097\nThe rookie season for the No. 2 pick in 2012 was magical: 20 touchdown passes, 3,200 passing yards, 815 rushing yards and only five interceptions. With Griffin, the zone-read became a popular play. He said he was happy to run the ball and dismissed the idea that he wanted to be only a drop-back passer after injuring his knee late in his rookie season, but Mike Shanahan says now, \"If Robert would have embraced the type of quarterback he was, I thought he could do so many things other quarterbacks couldn't do.\"\nSaid Griffin: \"Some defensive coordinators said that college stuff won't work, but we made it work -- and not just a little bit; we made it a staple of what we did. That showed coaches around the league you can do this with athletic quarterbacks.\"\nKeim's take: It is hard to top the impact of his rookie season, which is why I would have slotted him in this same spot. Based on his next three years, he would be far lower on the list.\nKiper's take on Griffin (2012 first-round draft pick, No. 2 overall): Some people liked RG III better than [No. 1 overall pick in 2012] Andrew Luck. [Longtime NFL coach] Tony Dungy went on record as liking RG III better. I gave Luck a 9.8 grade; I gave RG III a 9.4 grade. Nobody could argue with [Washington] taking RG III in that draft. Early on, he looked like he was going to be phenomenal. ... That injury was a big thing. As a rookie he looked like he was going to be better than Luck.\n2. Brad Johnson (1999-2000)*\nGames: 30 | Record: 18-11 | TDs: 35 | INTs: 28 | Pass yards: 6,510\nAfter Washington couldn't re-sign Green, it traded for Johnson, who threw for 4,005 yards and 24 touchdowns and was the NFL's fifth-ranked passer on the NFL's second-ranked offense in 1999. Washington won the NFC East, but Snyder signed George in the offseason.\nThat was the beginning of the end for Johnson, who knew, after multiple meetings with Snyder, that his days were numbered. Schottenheimer asked him to stay because Johnson was a good fit, but the damage was done. Johnson went to the Buccaneers, leading them to victory in Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.\n\"[Washington] was one place I would have wanted to stay,\" said Johnson, who played for four teams, including two stints with the Minnesota Vikings. \"I always told my wife and my close friends that I wish it would have worked out in Washington.\"\nSaid Mitchell: \"I would say Dan [Snyder] regrets that move, letting Brad leave, more than anything in the world. Brad was a real quarterback. He wasn't sexy, but he was intellectual.\"\nKeim's take: He would be tops on my list. The biggest issue was that he played only two years and was hurt for one of them.\n1. Kirk Cousins (2012-17)*\nGames: 64 | Record: 26-31-1 | TDs: 99 | INTs: 55 | Pass yards: 16,206\nCoaches always liked Cousins' ability and knowledge, and in 2015 it became obvious he should start. That season he threw for 4,166 yards, 29 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.\n\"[Before] if something bad happened he'd hang his head, but once he started having confidence, that's when he flourished,\" Gruden said.\nBut to keep Cousins, Washington needed to use the franchise tag in consecutive years. Once the team applied the first one, Cousins' side knew he would never sign a long-term deal because his price would be too high. The sides never came close to a deal.\nKeim's take: I understand why the analytics put him this high, but I would rank him second. If you had to win one game and were choosing between Cousins and Brad Johnson, I would take the latter."
