It expanded to 670\u33a1, 1.5 times larger than the Seoul Pavilion, which operated independently in 2023.\nSBA gathered and supported 81 promising startups by collaborating with eight major Seoul-based universities, one city district (Gwanak-gu), and three city startup facilities (Seoul Bio Hub, Seoul AI Hub, Campus Town). The participating companies were divided into categories such as healthcare (31), AI (25), manufacturing (11), mobility (7), ESG (4), and quantum (3).\nMeanwhile, the Seoul Integrated Pavilion creatively expressed the diverse charm of Seoul by incorporating the 2024 Seoul color theme, 'Sky Coral,' through an LED panorama lighting display.\nIn addition to exhibiting their products, seven companies from the Seoul Integrated Pavilion participated in the official media event\u00a0'CES 2024 Unveiled' held on January 7th at CES. This event, targeting official CES media, provided a valuable opportunity for startups to gain media exposure.\nThe participating companies in 'CES 2024 Unveiled' included NationA, Hurotics, ENHANCE, LordSystem, DNA Corporation, Solive Ventures, and BarunBio. Due to the nature of CES, where leading global companies take the spotlight, it can be challenging for startups with lower visibility to gain media exposure. Therefore, 'CES 2024 Unveiled' provided a valuable opportunity for startups to address their thirst for media publicity by receiving concentrated attention from global media.\nSOURCE Seoul Business Agency\nModal title\nAlso from this source\nSeoul Business Agency (SBA) Hosts Seoul Innovation Forum at CES 2024\nSeoul Business Agency (SBA), Seoul's innovation support organization working towards creating a smart city in Seoul, held the Seoul Innovation Forum...\nExplore\nConsumer Electronics\nComputer & Electronics\nTrade Show News\nSmall Business Services\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"

It is also more than double the size of last year.\nThe number of Korean companies that won the CES Innovation Award, jointly presented by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) and the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), is also the largest ever. Of the 310 award-winning companies announced in November 2023, 143 Korean companies account for about 46 percent, and 13 of them will be participating in the Korean Pavilion. Notably, KOTRA supported CES Innovation Award winning in multi-faceted ways by \u25b2 giving lecture on Innovation Awards winning strategies \u25b2 mentoring on how to fill out Innovation Awards application form and \u25b2 supporting application fees. On the back of such support, two companies participating in the Korean Pavilion were honored with the 'Best of Innovation\", which is awarded only to the best products of the Innovation Award recipients.\nOn January 10, 'K-Innovation Day' event will be held to open the possibility for Korean startups to enter the North American market. In the first session, 15 startups, having been selected through pre-application and review process, will be on the stage to have pitching opportunities for global companies and major VC with demand for open innovation technology, such as Walmart, IBM, and KPMG.
