Key highlights include Qualcomm and NVIDIA's competition in SoCs for digital cockpits and ADAS fusion, Intel's strategic shift in the EV market with AI-powered SoCs, and an open chiplet platform. This blog provides a summary and insights on crucial announcements made by industry leaders.\nAlvin Liu\u00a0and\u00a0Jason Low\n24 January 2024 | Est. read time : 3 min\nCES 2024 welcomed a return to pre-pandemic attendance levels with 135,000 participants. A dominant theme was Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), focusing on AI, software, cloud and tools for accelerating EV development. Notable absentees included Detroit\u2019s big three, but Honda, Hyundai and KIA took the spotlight. While Chinese carmakers had a limited presence, specialized Chinese suppliers in ADAS and digital cockpits were present. Canalys received inquiries from key exhibitors regarding the Chinese market.\nThe automotive semiconductor sector witnessed heightened competition, marked by AMD\u2019s entry, Intel\u2019s new System-on-Chips (SoCs) and its acquisition of Silicon Mobility. NVIDIA secured design wins with Chinese EV manufacturers and Qualcomm emphasized industry leadership and platform enhancements.\nQualcomm and NVIDIA\nAt the CES 2024 exhibition, both Qualcomm and NVIDIA highlighted the latest ongoing collaboration process of SoCs, which supports digital cockpit and ADAS features. In the transition from domain controllers to central computing in the new EV electronic/electrical architecture, these two companies, dominant in developing high-performance chips for digital cockpits and assisted driving with high development thresholds, emphasized the inheritability between new and old solutions. They aim to reduce the sunk costs of automotive OEM iterations, solidify their respective product ecosystems and strengthen their influence in each other\u2019s core markets.\nQualcomm and Bosch jointly unveiled the world\u2019s first cross-domain in-vehicle central computing platform based on Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Flex (with computing power scalable up to 2,000 TOPs). This product launch brings positive impacts to both parties, as Bosch leverages the robust performance in the digital cockpit market generated by the deployment of the Snapdragon SA8155P, leading Qualcomm to gain more market share. Simultaneously, the new cost-effective platform is expected to help Bosch maintain its leading position in the digital cockpit sector while enhancing its influence in the assisted driving field.\nIn addition, Qualcomm also showcased its latest cockpit-driving integrated solutions with Chinese solution providers such as Autolink, Megatronix and Thunderx. The Connected Cars solution will debut on the Neta Shanhai Platform 2.0\u2019s model.\nNVIDIA announced that the Thor chip platform (with computing power of up to 2,000 TOPs) would be applied in Li Auto\u2019s next-generation models. Furthermore, Great Wall Motors, ZEEKR and Xiaomi have adopted the Orin chipset to develop next-generation assisted driving systems. NVIDIA\u2019s strategy is straightforward in promoting cockpit-driving integrated solutions, offering only a single ultra-high compute platform solution. By ensuring Thor is compatible with the same software development kit (SDK) as Orin, NVIDIA aims to reduce the sunk costs for automakers choosing Orin.\nIn contrast to NVIDIA\u2019s focus on the integrated cabin and driving field, Qualcomm concentrates on meeting OEMs\u2019 long-term strategic development needs in different stages of intelligent development by combining different chips to form scalable low, mid and high-end systems. This approach allows Qualcomm to target a broader range of customer groups.\nIntel\nIntel\u2019s CES 2024 automotive announcements were far more than just product reveals; they marked a strategic shift toward dominating the future of mobility. The acquisition of Silicon Mobility, an EV energy management leader, signals a clear ambition to become a powerhouse in the rapidly growing EV market. This aggressive move not only positions Intel as a direct competitor to established players like NVIDIA and Bosch but also challenges the traditional, closed-loop structure of the industry.\nThe unveiling of AI-powered software-defined SoCs empowers automakers with the next-generation technology they need to build ever-smarter, autonomous vehicles. But perhaps the most disruptive innovation is the introduction of an open chiplet platform by Intel. This revolutionary system allows for greater flexibility and customization, potentially lowering costs and fostering rapid advancements in automotive technology.\nThe implications of Intel\u2019s strategy are significant. Their aggressive moves could attract more OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to their platform, creating a robust ecosystem around their offerings. This, in turn, could further erode the dominance of established players and pave the way for a more open, collaborative automotive landscape. However, success will not be guaranteed. Regulatory hurdles, consumer adoption of new technologies and navigating complex industry dynamics will all play crucial roles in determining the ultimate impact of Intel\u2019s vision.\nYou may also want to read\nSamsung Galaxy S24: unveiling Samsung\u2019s AI-driven future roadmap\n18 January 2024\nXiaomi\u2019s first Wear OS smartwatch marks a change in strategic direction\n11 January 2024\nCanalys announces 2023\u2019s vendor Champions in the Cybersecurity Leadership Matrix\n11 January 2024\nITC ban escalation: Apple\u2019s impending challenges and strategic maneuvers\n10 January 2024\nYour Privacy\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\nPerformance Cookies\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

        "raw_content": "Consumer Technology Association\nCES 2024: Rubber hits the road for the connected car\nThe world\u2019s leading consumer electronics show has changed \u2013 from connected kitchens and cleaners, it is now, say some, the Detroit Auto Show on steroids. We see which roads are about to be taken in this new space for computing\nTo aficionados, CES has always meant days of madness, with visitors to its home at the Las Vegas Convention Centre (LVCC) surrounded by a morass of newfangled consumer electronics. In the past, these have ranged from TVs measuring hundreds of inches and displays covering whole walls, to connected kettles, fridges and other kitchen appliances, to robotic vacuum cleaners and robots of varied forms. The internet of things (IoT) in its truest sense.\nYet at CES 2024, in what probably is the first true post-Covid show, there was a very apparent, and almost literal, new drive to the event. While all of the varied connected appliances and technologies were there in force as ever \u2013 with the leaders in TV and video, such as Sony, Panasonic and Hisense, showing off their latest ranges \u2013 the main attention hit the highway, with connected automotive use cases exemplifying the emergence of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) in what industry leaders are calling the new era of computing.\nThis point was made very strongly in one of the keynote addresses. Fox\u202fBusiness Network\u2019s Liz Claman noted that she had been coming to CES for many a year and that she could remember the first time the industry arrived at the show in the middle of the last decade in the form of former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, the first auto executive of his status to be invited to speak there.\nWhile making the case that in-vehicle connectivity is nothing new, Claman said CES 2024 showed just how far it had come in that time and that CES was now effectively the Detroit Auto Show \u2013 the flagship event for the industry as a whole \u2013 \u201con steroids\u201d.\nCES showed car manufacturers\u2019 rapid increase in the electrification of their product lines, leading to a sharp increase in in-car electronics such as digital cockpits,\u202fadvanced driver assistance systems\u202f(ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment systems.\nClaman was not alone in her take. Just before the doors opened on CES, analyst IDTechEx released a report forecasting a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in automotive software-related revenue by 2034, putting software-related revenue at more than $700bn annually.\nThe study,\u202fConnected and software-defined vehicles 2024-2034: markets, forecasts, technologies,\u202fnoted that the most basic form of SDV is where the user experience is affected in some way by the software in a vehicle. It said that, generally, a software-defined vehicle requires a constant cellular connection (4G or 5G), a large, touch-enabled screen, and a powerful central compute system that is also connected to the vehicle\u2019s constituent components. Many SDVs also incorporate third-party apps and in-vehicle payments to add more features and convenience to drivers.\nIndeed, a visitor to the LVCC\u2019s recently built West Hall would have been struck by just how many of the leading automotive manufacturers were showing off their range of connected vehicles. BMW was right by the front door, and not far away on the CES parking lot were connected vehicles from the likes of Mercedes, Jeep, John Deere and Hyundai, surrounded by IT and communications leaders whose products were making these vehicles smarter and equipped for the forthcoming days of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks that will almost certainly be the basis for future driving experiences.\nCars and computers connect\nFox\u2019s Claman was there to set the scene for this brave new connected world, interviewing Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon to show exactly how IT leaders were engaging with automotive as a key market. Amon suggested CES was now \u201ca car show, among other things\u201d, with vehicles being a new space for computing.\nHe added that Qualcomm was undergoing a fundamental shift in how it sees itself, from a wireless communications company to being a connected processor and artificial intelligence (AI) company. The overarching strategy for the company going forward is to tap into the growing world of AI in local devices.\n\u201cWe have been very passionate about the role of AI in the devices we carry. We\u2019ve been talking about on-device [AI for a long time] and our job was [to make] a computing engine that is going to make that technology run pervasively \u2026 The next form of computing, which is accelerated computing for AI, is going to happen everywhere. There\u2019s fundamentally one thing that is different now. I look at [AI on devices] as the foundation of many of the things we\u2019re doing with the Snapdragon digital cockpit and some of the rapid success we have had in automotive.\u201d\nIn aiming to realise Amon\u2019s vision, Qualcomm used CES 2024 to launch a range of automotive products based on its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform\u202fto support next-generation digital cockpits, connected car technologies, connected services, advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems. Within the Snapdragon roadmap, Qualcomm said automakers were being equipped to meet the increasing needs for higher levels of safety and intelligence powered by LTE,\u202f5G, connected services,\u202fV2X, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite communications and precise positioning.\nIn addition to bringing AI forward within the automotive sphere, Qualcomm believes connectivity remains integral to the global industry\u2019s digital transformation, powering what Amon calls an \u201cunprecedented amount of innovation\u201d. A key example is embedding the Salesforce CRM solution within the Snapdragon Cockpit and trialling financial solutions so that digital payments can be made from a car and associated with individual drivers.\nIn an example of where its automotive technology is being deployed, Qualcomm has signed a deal with Robert Bosch to introduce a central vehicle computer capable of running infotainment and\u202fadvanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities\u202fon a single system-on-chip (SoC). Bosch\u2019s new central vehicle computer, known as the\u202fcockpit & ADAS integration platform, is based on the\u202fSnapdragon Ride Flex\u202fSoC. Together, the companies say they have successfully executed several in-vehicle infotainment projects and established a global customer base in this area.\nThe Bosch deal also highlights the fact that one of the key aspects of the connected vehicle marketplace is that is it dependent on a strong ecosystem, with partners from across the traditional automotive supply chain working in conjunction with the IT and comms industry.\nDigital twins for faster development\nMarelli is a mobility technology supplier to the automotive sector, whose stated mission is to transform the future of mobility through working with customers and partners to create a \u201csafer, greener and better-connected world\u201d.\nIts key products include automotive lighting and sensing, electronics systems, electric powertrains, green technology solutions and interior experiences. The latter comprises cockpit module assemblies and modules to manufacturers, from steering members to cockpits and consoles. As SDVs, powertrain evolution, advanced connectivity and autonomy are rapidly reshaping the needs, designs and architectures of next-generation vehicles, Marelli says its approach will be based on co-creating the future of mobility with its customers, suppliers and leading technology partners.\nThe company used CES 2024 to show the IT and comms partnerships it had to offer to automotive manufacturers \u2013 not just the in-car products it could support, but also the connected services that such vehicles could take advantage of to produce digital cockpits and infotainment systems. Its key partners include Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and BlackBerry QNX.\nThe firm stresses that complexity within vehicles is getting higher and higher, and the key to accelerated development of new products and services is the cloud.\nIn a demonstration at CES 2024, the firm showed a number of its connected vehicle options with its partners, in particular showing off the benefits of creating a digital twin of the digital cockpit using a Qualcomm generation four chip, BlackBerry QNX Hypervisor, and a cluster and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) applications running on top of that with a virtual version running on the cloud. The virtual setup comprised AWS cloud infrastructure, Qualcomm emulated hardware and QNX hypervisor.\nOffering a reason for using a digital twin, Marelli notes that a traditional automotive production development programme is very linear: you start with hardware, then you do software, then integration. Typically, it takes about three years, which Marelli says is just no longer an acceptable development timeline. With a digital twin, manufacturers can decouple hardware development from software developers and start developing in the cloud on virtualised hardware. And when the hardware is ready, manufacturers can take the software, put it on the hardware and continue integration and testing.\nMarelli estimates that this will reduce standard development timelines by up to 70% \u2013 from 36 months to 12-16 months \u2013 and reduce hardware costs by 30% because fewer physical hardware samples would be needed for development and testing. In the CES demo, Marelli created a digital twin for a zonal architecture, testing out the media player and other key functions within the cluster display.\nThe next big area of focus from a development perspective will be with microcontrollers, which still drive a lot of products in vehicles. A virtual product is expected at CES 2025.\nSupporting car connectivity\nThose of a certain age would have been hugely interested to see the return of BlackBerry to the comms market. Even after its meteoric fall after defining mobile business in the immediate post-millennial era, the company never went away. And while renaissance may not yet be the word to describe the company\u2019s overall status in the comms industry, at CES it was most certainly back with interesting solutions.\nAt the show, BlackBerry revealed the general availability of version 8.0 of its QNX Software Development Platform\u00a0(SDP) which is designed to deliver a scalable, high-performance, real-time operating system for the current embedded computing industry, offering particular support for next-generation automotive and IoT systems. It also announced that it is working with AWS on the creation of a virtual cockpit\u00a0platform for manufacturer Stellantis as part of its virtual engineering workbench, enabling the delivery of infotainment technology.\nAnother manufacturer BlackBerry is working with is Jeep, a user of its IVY mobility platform. Tarun Shome, product management director for BlackBerry IVY, revealed at CES 2024 that the company has been in the automotive industry for some time and currently provides secure access technology for over 235 million today.\nExplaining BlackBerry IVY\u2019s function, Shome reemphasised Qualcomm\u2019s Amon\u2019s point about the power of local devices. \u201cIt\u2019s a middleware platform that allows us to take signals from the vehicle and create rich insights from the vehicle edge. So rather than actually processing in the cloud, sending loads of connected vehicle data, we have the ability to use the compute power that we have within the vehicle to then provide insights on signals,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed it in conjunction with AWS, so as a partnership, and we then have some elements that allow us to control and configure everything from the code, and then to deploy software artefacts that run within our runtime on the vehicle to create these insights,\u201d Shome added.\nShome sees specific opportunities arising from being able to create meaningful insights from data that is created from within the vehicle. BlackBerry is also looking to offer business efficiencies. Shome believes the BlackBerry technology can help reduce connectivity costs for connected vehicles by 70% of the connectivity costs due to processing in the vehicle, and that around 97% of compute costs can be taken away for some of the use cases.\nIn addition to AWS, BlackBerry is working with a range of ecosystem partners for its system to be implemented by the likes of Jeep. Shome revealed specific examples: \u201cIf you look at the partnerships we have, we have companies that are providing driver monitoring systems, we have companies that are providing tyre wear predictions, running IVI by taking information from the wheels. We have insurance-based use cases to where you typically have a telematics black box that you can replace with a software component. We have a company that\u2019s looking at micro adjustments on your steering wheel and showing you [driver performance]. We have crash analysis by using the forward-facing cameras, and also sensors on the vehicle to detect crashes and create a report. We have facial recognition and offer [fleet managers] driver monitoring. What we want to do is to provide the tools to allow [manufacturers] to build out the use cases.\u201d\nFuture thinking\nWhile CES 2024 highlighted a whole host of technologies that could be implemented into automotive use cases, the one caveat is that the current infotainment innovations may not be hitting the road in commercially available vehicles for some time yet. Maybe not until 2028 or later. By this time, the industry will likely be seeing the first in a range of 6G connectivity services. So how far do technology firms need to be thinking ahead when it comes to connectivity?\nEnrico Salvatori, senior vice-president and president of Qualcomm Europe, noted that his company was very aware of the capabilities of the next generation of mobile, working with other players in the market to set \u201centry procedures\u201d and set their specifications requirements. Yet he stressed there was plenty more that could be done in terms of 5G.\n\u201c[6G] is one effort ongoing, even though in the initial phase. There are still a lot of big R&D efforts in the development of 5G, so there is still a lot of work to be done on 5G for us, in particular in terms of implementing the modem, the chipset, the new performance. [In that], there is a gain. We think edge AI will see a huge effort in R&D driving the future and we are already there, but there will be more to come.\n\u201cBecause this is automotive, you will see more and more SDV needs. You need to have a central compute platform with high performance. And then by software, you define the connected car \u2013 is it an entry-level or mid-range model? And with the software, we can do over-the-air updates. And because of 5G, it will drive the evolution of performance. With AI, everything is done by software, but we need to go to work on hardware to be ready to support the additional software performance requested in the future.\u201d\nAnd as CES 2024 showed, for \u201cadditional\u201d, read \u201chuge\u201d. Past CES events have tended to leave visitors wondering whether what they saw will ever be commercialised. It\u2019s doubtful this will be the case for what anyone saw at CES 2024 in the automotive space.

He added that the company was undergoing a fundamental shift in how it sees itself, from a wireless communication company to being a connected processor and artificial intelligence company.\n\u201cWe have been very passionate about the role of AI in the devices that we carry. We\u2019ve been talking about on-device [AI for a long time] and it our job was [to make] a computing engine that is going to make that technology run pervasive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are at a point that those capabilities in the processors in the semiconductors are becoming available. The next step will be the development stages and the applications. The next form of computing, which is accelerated computing for AI, is going to happen everywhere. We\u2019ve been busy developing technologies that allow you to do that without compromising battery life.\u201d\nWhile noting the essential part cloud is playing in the current digital world, Amon said he found it interesting how AI in devices was seen to be developing differently from the cloud. He said devices were the core of personalisation, with devices having more knowledge of users\u2019 preferences and workstyles. Development would see devices having the ability to run very large AI language models, with billions of possible parameters for instant responses to queries. All of this, Amon predicted, would result in a change in user experience.\n\u201cYou are going to have this assistance that is going to be there with you [and the device] is going to learn from your behaviour. And that\u2019s where [the intersection is] about doing AI on the devices,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen you do a query on the cloud, you provide some information [for it] to know you and to give you an answer. But when you provide the cloud and the device working together, devices will [have] context such as where you are, who you are, and what the relevance of that information is \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what makes it all this very exciting and transformative.\u201d\nAt CES 2024, this transformation was most pronounced in automotives. Having established a legacy of providing some essential building blocks for smart phones, computers and other business devices, Qualcomm is now gearing up to be at the heart of the new automotive industry, tapping into to manufacturers\u2019 rapid increase in the electrification of product lines, leading to a sharp increase in in-car electronics such as digital cockpits, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment.\nEarlier at CES, Qualcomm announced a range of automotive products based on its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform to support next-generation digital cockpits, connected car technologies, connected services, advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems.\nPutting the launch of the new product line into context, Amon described cars as a new computing space and that, by extension, CES is now \u201ca car show, among other things\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s fundamentally one thing that is different now. I look at that as the foundation of many of the things we\u2019re doing with the Snapdragon digital cockpit and some of the rapid success we had an automotive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe car is a new computing space \u2013 that\u2019s probably the best way I can describe it. We have a number of examples of this at the show. Salesforce is embedded into the Snapdragon Digital cockpit, so you can do CRM in the car.\n\u201cInsurance companies want to embed their services into the car. You have distribution of television content, gaming...so the car is a new community space and that is a revolution that is going to create a huge opportunity for different companies, and Qualcomm provides that digital engine.\u201d\nRead more about CES 2024\nMany organizations recognize the importance of edge computing.

Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

BROWN/AFP).\nCES 2024: Intel and Qualcomm to take on Nvidia in automotive industry\nBy Aaron Raj | 11 January, 2024\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024, announcements in the automotive industry are always most highly anticipated. Apart from tech companies unveiling their latest innovations in various products and services, carmakers also showcase new models and features. But the automotive industry is just one part of CES 2024.\nAs expected, AI was center stage at this year\u2019s CES, with most of the new products built on the technology\u2019s use cases. That includes self-driving baby carriages, chatbots in cars as well as AI in beauty products. Among the big names participating were European and Chinese carmakers, mobile phone companies, and chip companies.\nAaron Raj | 10 January, 2024\nNvidia, which dominated most of the announcements at CES 2024, unveiled several new products for gaming laptops as well as new partnerships with EV carmakers in China. But apart from Nvidia, two other chip companies are hoping to not only make an impact at CES 2024 but also challenge Nvidia across the year with their products.\nIntel and Qualcomm Technologies have long dominated the mobile and laptop market. The chips produced by these two companies continue to enable innovation in these devices as well. And with AI adoption increasing, both Intel and Qualcomm are hoping to play an important role in developing the technology with a big focus on the automotive industry.\nQualcomm Technologies announced breakthrough innovations across its Snapdragon Digital Chassis portfolio.\nQualcomm continues to innovate in the automotive industry\nAt CES 2024, Qualcomm Technologies announced breakthrough innovations across its Snapdragon Digital Chassis portfolio.\u00a0 The company is in its twentieth year of supplying technology for the automotive industry, with revenue growing by double digits year-over-year, which has been driven by the increased adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis solutions.\n\u201cOur commitment to advancing automotive technology in support of global automakers, Tier-1 suppliers and our ecosystem partners is helping shape the future of software-defined vehicles and is accelerating us into a new era for the automotive industry,\u201d said Nakul Duggal, SVP and general manager, automotive & cloud computing, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.\nSome of the offerings by Qualcomm for the automotive industry.

The acquisition of Silicon Mobility aligns with our sustainability goals while addressing a critical energy management need for the industry,\u201d said Jack Weast, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive.\nAndy An (left), president of Geely Holding Group and CEO of Zeekr Intelligent Technology, greets Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (center) and Jack Weast, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive, on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024, at CES in Las Vegas. (Credit: Intel Corporation).\nGiven that Nvidia has grown its influence in the EV industry, apart from the acquisition, Intel also has a new family of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle\u00a0system-on-chips (SoCs). China\u2019s Zeekr will be the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to adopt the new SoC to deliver its generative AI-driven living room experiences to next-generation vehicles.\nThe new family of AI-enhanced SDV SoCs addresses a critical industry need for power and performance scalability. The family of SoCs features AI acceleration capabilities from Intel\u2019s AI PC roadmap to enable the most desirable in-vehicle AI use cases, such as driver and passenger monitoring.\n\u201cIntel\u2019s AI-enhanced SDV SoCs combine the best of AI PC and Intel data center technologies necessary to support a true software-defined vehicle architecture,\u201d added Weast.\nTo ensure the strict quality and reliability requirements necessary for automotive use cases, Intel plans to work with R&D hub Imec. The R&D company will ensure Intel\u2019s advanced chiplet packaging technologies meet the requirements set. The move underscores a commitment to be the first automotive supplier to support the integration of third-party chiplets into its automotive products.\nIntel SoCs are in more than 50 million vehicles, powering infotainment, displays, digital instrument clusters and more. Intel\u2019s expanded AI-enhanced \u201cwhole vehicle\u201d roadmap will move the industry toward a more scalable, software-defined and sustainable future.\nBy Aaron Raj\nAaron Raj\nAaron enjoys writing about enterprise technology in the region.

Once again, team Engadget has set up shop in Las Vegas for CES, living out of suitcases so that we can scour the massive show floor and occasionally injure ourselves in the process. For CES 2024, we expected to see AI everywhere, and we were not disappointed.\nWe saw more than a few laptops with AI-powered chips inside, not to mention multiple references to Microsoft's Copilot assistant. Volkswagen built ChatGPT into its in-car system, while BMW teamed up with Amazon to improve its own in-car assistant. Qualcomm announced an AI Snapdragon chip. Walmart came to CES for the first time to announce its building generative AI into its online shopping experience. Even SAG-AFTRA struck a deal for AI and voice acting at CES (not that the actors themselves consider it a good deal).\nMeanwhile, The Rabbit R1, a device co-designed by Teenage Engineering, was the surprise hit at this year's show \u2014 so hot we haven't been able to see it in person ourselves as of this writing. And then there were the oddballs: a grill that uses AI to help cook a steak in 90 seconds, and a cat door that automatically locks when it knows your pet is about to drag in a mouse.\nThen there were not one, but two transparent TVs: one from Samsung and one from LG. Remember when rollable TVs were the thing? Oh, and GE kindly fed us beef tenderloin cooked with an indoor smoker. It was delicious.\nNotably, too, there was a lot less pee on the show floor this year. (But we did find some.)\nToday is our team's last day on the ground, which means it's also time for us to announce our annual Best of CES award winners. You may notice an obvious difference this year, which is that we've gotten rid of categories. From our point of view, we still attempted to see as broad a range of products as possible: laptops, mobile devices, gaming gear, smart home stuff, cars and items meant for people with disabilities. When it came to choosing winners, though, we saved time not having to debate amongst ourselves whether something was a laptop or a gaming device, a wearable or an accessibility device. A good product is just a good product.\nWithout further ado, we present our winners for CES 2024. But don't mistake this for the last of our coverage: We have other stories, recaps and roundups in the pipeline for you to read over the coming days. Keep following along. \u2014 Dana Wollman, Editor-in-Chief\nASUS ROG Zephyrus G14\nNot only is the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 powerful enough to run the latest blockbuster video games, but it's also incredibly sleek. The ROG Zephyrus G14 has an aluminum chassis with clean lines, crisp edges and a thinner, lighter design than previous models. A simple LED slash runs across the lid and can be programmed to glow in gray or white, rather than the garish rainbow favored by other gaming laptops. The ROG Zephyrus G14 looks sophisticated, and it can also run any title on the market, thanks to its AMD Ryzen 8000 series processors and optional NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU at the high end. Top-of-the-line specs and a minimalist design make the latest ASUS line stand out in a sea of other game-focused devices at CES. This is what gaming laptops look like when they're all grown up. \u2014 Jessica Conditt, senior reporter\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's line of Frame TVs, first introduced back in 2017, do a great job of disguising a large-screen TV as a piece of art. The Samsung Music Frame does the same thing, but for wireless speakers. Instead of a screen, there's a place to display art or album covers that you swap pretty easily.\nThis wouldn't be noteworthy if the Music Frame didn't sound good \u2014 but in our demo, it did. The Music Frame includes two woofers, two tweeters and two mid-range drivers and supports Dolby Atmos. It's also quite the flexible speaker, working on its own, in a stereo pair or connected to a TV as part of a bigger home theater setup. It's even wall-mountable. We have no price or release date, but given Samsung's success with the Frame TVs, we imagine they won't wait long to get the Music Frame on the market. \u2014 Nathan Ingraham, deputy editor\nLG Signature OLED T\nOLED TVs are great. An OLED TV you can see through \u2014 well, that\u2019s just wild. The LG Signature OLED T isn\u2019t the first transparent display we\u2019ve seen at CES, but it is the first that will actually be sold to consumers (unlike Samsung\u2019s similar transparent MicroLED concept).\nThis is a 77-inch set with an retractable contrast screen. Keep the filter up, and it looks like one of LGs standard, excellent OLED sets. Bring it down, and the image almost looks like it\u2019s floating in mid-air. Like Samsung\u2019s Frame TVs, the Signature OLED T is designed for ambience \u2014 when you\u2019re not watching a show or movie, it can display little animations (a digital fish tank, for instance). To help it feel less obtrusive, the TV also uses LG\u2019s wireless Zero Connect tech, which relegates most of the set\u2019s I/O (and thus cables) to a separate box that can be tucked away elsewhere.\nThe TV does lack the microlens array tech found in LG\u2019s absolute best OLED TVs and LG isn\u2019t sure if it will come with the furniture you see in the image above. The company says it will ship sometime in 2024, though there\u2019s no firm release date yet. But whenever it does arrive, it will almost certainly be prohibitively expensive for most people. \u2014 Jeff Dunn, senior commerce writer\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro\nWith its third-generation NXTPAPER display, TCL\u2019s latest 14-inch tablet combines the best things about LCD displays and e-readers. You get a sharp 2.8K-resolution panel with bright colors plus a special nano-coating that not only reduces glare, but also cuts down excess blue light while providing a lovely matte texture. And for those who prefer a more traditional newspaper-like reading experience, there\u2019s a monochrome mode that makes the NXTPAPER 14 Pro look like it has an e-ink screen. So while its specs aren\u2019t all that impressive (MediaTek Dimensity 8020, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage), TCL\u2019s new tablet is one of those rare gadgets that appeals to both hardcore tech nerds and traditionalists that still remember a time before everything went digital. \u2014 Sam Rutherford, senior reporter\nASUS ZenBook Duo\nASUS has been chasing the dream of dual-screen notebooks for a while, but this year's ZenBook Duo appears to be its best attempt yet. It consists of two separate components: a dual-screen display unit and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. You can use the ZenBook Duo in a typical clamshell mode, with the keyboard in front of one of its displays. But when you have more room, you can open up the display to have two screens sitting on top of each other (balanced on a built-in kickstand).\nThe ZenBook Duo also feels incredibly polished, and it has high-end hardware like Intel's Core Ultra chips and gorgeous OLED screens. It also starts at a reasonable $1,500, making it a dual-screen laptop for the masses. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, senior reporter\nWithings BeamO\nThere\u2019s never a shortage of health and fitness tech at CES. This year Withings stood out with its $250 BeamO \u201cmultiscope.\u201d It combines a body temperature sensor, an electrocardiogram, an oximeter and a digital stethoscope into one surprisingly light consumer device that promises to make it easier to collect basic health metrics at home. The company's Health Mate app collects all of that data, which can then be sent to doctors with a few taps. Withings is also seeking FDA approvals for the BeamO to be able to detect atrial fibrillation.\nBeamO impressed us not only with its versatility and fairly affordable price, but also for the potential impact it could have on telemedicine. Providing your doctor with key metrics ahead of a call or visit could make it easier for them to give you sound medical advice. And those with chronic conditions could use BeamO to keep track of health data over the long term. \u2014 Valentina Palladino, senior commerce editor\nEcoFlow Delta Ultra\nA whole-home battery and inverter system is far from the funkiest bit of hardware we saw at CES, but it\u2019s likely one of the more useful. The EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra can take in and store power from your rooftop solar panels then use the stored energy to power your home. The DELTA Pro Ultra can even suck up juice from the grid when it's cheaper, and feed it back when energy prices surge.\nA base configuration goes for $5,800 and includes one 6kWh battery and inverter, but you can stack up to five batteries per inverter and chain up to three inverter-and-battery stacks, amounting to a 90kWh capacity. That\u2019s a beastly amount of power that could keep a McMansion humming at full tilt for a few days \u2014 or run essential appliances in a more moderately sized home for a month or longer.\nThe DELTA Pro Ultra can also hook into an existing transfer switch if you have one, but for deeper integration with your home\u2019s power system, the subpanel-like Smart Home Panel 2 gives you features like app control, weather and power grid monitoring, and instant switchover to backup when the power goes out. As more solar panels are installed on rooftops, a sleek and powerful all-in-one battery solution like this can give people more control over how their power is used. If you\u2019re intrigued, you don\u2019t have to wait \u2014 it\u2019s one of many CES 2024 gadgets already on the market. \u2014 Amy Skorheim, commerce writer\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nWhen it comes to smoking meat at home, your options are usually limited to outdoor grills that burn charcoal, pellets or wood. If you live at a place where your landlord doesn't allow open flames, like apartments, then you're pretty much out of luck. The GE Profile Smoker ditches the flames for electric heating elements and brings low-and-slow smoking indoors.\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is no gimmick either. It\u2019s capable of infusing significant smoke flavor via wood pellets as we experienced first hand this week. There won't be any smoke wafting around your kitchen as the unit captures all of that with its filtration system. If you need to cook while you're away, a unique feature does that and then holds your food at a safe temperature until you're ready to serve. Toss in Wi-Fi for remote cooking and monitoring, cooking profiles and guidance, plus the Clear Smoke tool for when you need to open the door, and the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker has a lot to offer a range of skill levels. \u2014 Billy Steele, senior reporter\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser's Momentum True Wireless series has consistently earned the accolade of the best-sounding earbuds in our best of list for a while now. However, the company never really had the complete package to knock Sony's 1000X series off the top spot. At CES this year, Sennheiser debuted the fourth-gen version of its flagship earbuds, which bring a host of upgrades. They still sound excellent, ANC and transparency mode are also improved.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 did a great job blocking out the noisy Las Vegas suite, allowing us to focus on the selection of jazz we used to demo the earbuds. Transparency mode also sounded more natural, which will be a big help for calls and tuning into your surroundings. What's more, Sennheiser figured out a way for active noise cancellation to not drain the battery nearly as much as it typically does; the ANC here only cuts listening time by half an hour. \u2014 B.S.\nGyrogear GyroGlove\nThe number of accessibility and aging-related products that were good enough for us to consider for awards at CES 2024 was encouragingly high. We saw a tongue-operated touchpad, a hearing aid-like system that can isolate individual speakers in a noisy crowd and an audio display for gamers with hearing loss. But GyroGlove stood out for a few reasons.\nThe device uses a sophisticated gyroscope to help those with hand tremors (say, Parkinson's patients) stabilize their movement, but one of the deciding factors in picking it as a winner is the fact that it's actually available. The company said it's already in talks with the chief medical officers of several insurance providers in the US, and has registered the GyroGlove as a medical device with the FDA and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. It's certified by various international standards organizations, to boot. \u2014 Cherlynn Low, deputy editor\nKia Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBV)\nKia\u2019s PBV, or Platform Beyond Vehicles, concept is the rare car concept (or concepts, plural) that seems like it might actually be a real thing in the relatively near future. The PV5 is likely to be the first to make the leap. It\u2019s a small modular van that can be equipped with a taller roof for extra headroom, or turned into a pickup by swapping out the back two-thirds. It can also be turned into a taxi with extra seating for passengers.\nOne of the more interesting things is how the members of the PBV family, including the larger PV7 and the smaller PV1 are expected to work together. For instance, Kia imagines a rail system that can connect a PV7 directly to a PV1, transferring cargo to the smaller vehicle for last mile deliveries.\nMost importantly, PBV isn\u2019t some fantastical dream vehicle that will never be heard from again: Kia is already building a dedicated factory in Korea that\u2019s expected to be ready to pump out 150,000 vehicles in 2025. \u2014 Terrence O\u2019Brien, managing editor\nSamsung Ballie\nCES was a little light on notable robots this year, but Samsung revived one we loved when we first saw it way back in 2020. Ballie is an adorable, bowling ball-sized robot that rolls around your home, following you around like a robotic pet that's eager to please. Ballie is a lot bigger than it was when we saw it in 2020, and it now has a built-in 1080p projector so it can both show you things and speak to you when you ask it for help. Think of it like a Nest Hub on wheels.\nWe only got to see Ballie in a tightly-plotted demo at Samsung's booth, but it was simply delightful to watch Ballie roll around projecting workout routines, calendar updates and recipe videos on the walls. As with most smart home gadgets, there's a little bit of \"solution searching for a problem\" here. But it feels like Samsung nailed the form factor judging by how smoothly Ballie navigated its way around the demo area. And while many companies show off products like this that have no chance of actually reaching people in the real world, Samsung says Ballie will go on sale this year. \u2014 N.I.\nMicron LPCAMM2 laptop RAM modules\nIf you've ever been annoyed that you couldn't upgrade your RAM in an ultraportable laptop, Micron has a potential solution: LPCAMM2 memory. It's a new form factor that's 64 percent smaller than standard SODIMM RAM sticks, and it's also potentially far faster and more efficient. Best of all is that it's a self-contained unit that can easily be removed and upgraded down the line.\nLPCAMM2 RAM won't get as much hype as AI PCs, but it's something that could transform what's possible with future laptop designs. And if it means laptop makers stop soldering RAM directly onto motherboards, we'll call it a win. \u2014 D.H.\nBest in show: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nCES 2024 is often described as a TV show or car show, but sometimes it\u2019s more niche products that capture our imagination. GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker is a countertop device that makes proper barbecue in your kitchen without filling your home with smoke. It\u2019s designed to move air around the food to impart maximum smokiness inside, without letting airflow out. When your brisket, chicken or whatever is done, a filtration and catalyst system draws the smoke down, eventually expelling it as warm air.\nTypically smoking food requires constant adjustments and vigilance, but the Smart Indoor Smoker has six preset cooking modes, while you\u2019re able to adjust the degree of smokiness between five different levels. The wood pellets\u2019 only function is to add flavor and not fuel the actual cooking process, so only a handful are needed per smoke session.\nGE included a smart probe with the Smart Indoor Smoker too, so you can monitor the cooking process from a companion app and its Smoke and Hold feature can cook and smoke foods and keep them at food-safe temperatures for up to 24 hours. It\u2019s not small (it's around the size of a mini fridge), but it\u2019s stylish and simple to use, with a low barrier to entry for anyone tempted to try smoking their own foods. The device was also able to impart an impressive level of smokiness in only a few hours \u2014 we can\u2019t wait to see what low-and-slow smoking could do. \u2014 Mat Smith, UK bureau chief\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.
