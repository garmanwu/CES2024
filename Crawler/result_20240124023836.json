It expanded to 670\u33a1, 1.5 times larger than the Seoul Pavilion, which operated independently in 2023.\nSBA gathered and supported 81 promising startups by collaborating with eight major Seoul-based universities, one city district (Gwanak-gu), and three city startup facilities (Seoul Bio Hub, Seoul AI Hub, Campus Town). The participating companies were divided into categories such as healthcare (31), AI (25), manufacturing (11), mobility (7), ESG (4), and quantum (3).\nMeanwhile, the Seoul Integrated Pavilion creatively expressed the diverse charm of Seoul by incorporating the 2024 Seoul color theme, 'Sky Coral,' through an LED panorama lighting display.\nIn addition to exhibiting their products, seven companies from the Seoul Integrated Pavilion participated in the official media event\u00a0'CES 2024 Unveiled' held on January 7th at CES. This event, targeting official CES media, provided a valuable opportunity for startups to gain media exposure.\nThe participating companies in 'CES 2024 Unveiled' included NationA, Hurotics, ENHANCE, LordSystem, DNA Corporation, Solive Ventures, and BarunBio. Due to the nature of CES, where leading global companies take the spotlight, it can be challenging for startups with lower visibility to gain media exposure.

Startups in various fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), financial technology, security, drones, and medical care, received awards. As each year passes, the number of startups winning the CES Innovation Award seems to be increasing.\nAccording to the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) on the 26th, 2024 of the 310 winners of the 'CES 143 Innovation Award' announced so far are Korean companies. Of all the companies that won innovation awards this year, Korean companies accounted for a whopping 46%.\nThe CES Innovation Award is an award given by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the organizer of CES held in Las Vegas, USA, to products with outstanding technology, design, and innovation among innovative products from around the world. The Innovation Award is very meaningful to companies preparing to expand overseas. This is because it not only serves as an indicator that proves the technology of the product due to its high international public trust, but also greatly helps in increasing brand awareness and reliability.\nThis year's Innovation Award winners included domestic startups in various fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and healthcare. Artificial intelligence (AI) audio specialist company\u00a0\u2018Gaudio Lab\u2019won the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Web2 and Metaverse categories for its AI-based real-time noise removal solution 'Just Voice'. As a result, the company received the CES Innovation Award for the second year in a row.\nMedical AI solution company\u00a0\u2018Exosystems\u2019It also won the Innovation Award in the digital health category for its AI biomarker healthcare solution. This is the second time that Exosystems has won the Innovation Award since 2020. Exosystems has developed a sarcopenia diagnosis system that can be applied to patient groups in which it is difficult to perform physical function evaluation based on 'digital biomarker core technology' (MFI) that analyzes neuromuscular biosignals.\nOnoma AI won the innovation award in the most competitive category, AI. TwoToon, which received the Innovation Award, is a webtoon production engine that uses AI to understand context and develop stories.\nThere is also a startup that received the Best Innovation Award for two consecutive years. The Best Innovation Award is given only to products that receive higher scores among the innovation award products.\nBlockchain technology startup\u00a0ZCryptoContinuing from last year, it was selected for the Best Innovation Award for its blockchain-based online voting system 'zkVoting: Poll Station'. GK Voting is a system that safely delivers voting information without disclosing the voter's identity and voting details, and is evaluated as having complemented the problems of the existing offline polling place system, such as preventing the possibility of election manipulation.\nMeanwhile, the number of Korean startups that have received the CES 2024 Best Innovation Award announced so far is seven, surpassing last year's record of five, which was the highest ever.\nIn addition to ZCrypto \u25b3top table(3D food printing system \u2018ink\u2019) \u25b3Mandro(Robotic finger for partial amputees) \u25b3 TenMinds (Snoring relief system \u2018Motion Pillow\u2019) \u25b3Studio Lab(AI-based commerce creation solution 'Seller Canvas') \u25b3Load System (TripPass mobile passport platform) \u25b3OneCom (smartphone communicator for the visually impaired) won the Best Innovation Award.\n[More corporate information about the startups in this article can be found on the Unicorn Factory Big Data Platform.\u00a0\u2018Data Lab\u2019You can see it here.]\nSource: Money Today_Reporter Nam Rae Nam\n30103 Doum 6-ro, Sejong-si, Republic of Korea 11 Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport\nTel: 02-3667-3114 (Smart City Association)\n\u203b Please note that this website refuses to automatically collect published e-mail addresses.\n\u203b This homepage Chrome browser\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."

Established in 1905, the university was named after Goguryeo.[3] The university is one of the SKY universities.[4]\nThe student body consists of over 20,000 undergraduate students and over 10,000 graduate students. The university has 81 departments in 19 colleges and divisions, as well as 18 graduate schools. It has over 1,500 full-time faculty members with over 95% of them holding Ph.D. or equivalent qualification in their field.[5] The Korea University Alumni Association consists of more than 280,000 university graduates.[6]\nHistory[edit]\nBosung College[edit]\nKorea University was established on May 5, 1905, as Bosung College by Lee Yong-Ik, Treasurer of the Royal Household. The first College President was Hae-Uoung Shin. As an academic institution of nationalistic origin, it was regarded as a symbol of national pride during the colonial period (1910\u20131945).[7]\nShortly after Bosung College was established, the \"Korea\u2013Japan Protocol\" was signed, and Lee Yong-Ik went into exile to lead the resistance movement against Japan. His exile created financial hardship for the institution. The financial crisis was overcome when Sohn Byong-Hee, a leader of Chundokyo, a nationalist, religious, and political movement at the time, took over the management of the institution. By 1929, the institution once again faced a serious financial crisis as a result of the worldwide recession. This was alleviated when Kim Seong-su became the president of the college in 1932. At that time, Kim was managing Choong-Ang High School and the Dong-A Ilbo, a daily newspaper. In 1934, the main building was completed on a 63,000-pyeong area of land located in Anam-dong. Construction of the library started in 1935 to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Bosung College and was completed two years later. In July of the following year, a large athletic field, was added to the campus. In April 1944, the Japanese colonial government forced Bosung College to change its name and placed it under the supervision of the Japanese authorities. Following the legacy of Bosung Professional School, the predecessor institution was placed under the management of a foundation and relocated to a vast area in Anam-dong, where remarkable facilities were established.[8]\nModern Era[edit]\nFollowing independence in 1945, the status of Bosung College was elevated to that of a university comprising three colleges, Political Science and Law, Economics and Commerce, and Liberal Arts. The goal was to create a major cradle for nurturing talented individuals and cultivating national culture. Upon liberation from the fervent longing for independence from Japan, in the year 4279 by the traditional Korean calendar (1946), Bosung Professional School was reorganized and elevated to Korea University. This expansion significantly enhanced its offerings and scope, reflecting the grand ambitions of its founders. Hyun Sang-Yun, the first president, initiated an expansion of the campus by purchasing forest and land. In June 1949, Korea University awarded its first bachelor's degree and in September of the same year, the graduate school was established. Yu Chin-O, the fourth president, continued to expand Korea University with the establishment of the Division of Science within the College of Liberal Arts, as well as a fourth college, the College of Agriculture.[6] After that, Kim Seoung-su, the founder of Korea University, became the Vice President of Government of Korea. This influenced the Korea University's development.[9]\nIn June 1961 the present Liberal Arts building (Seokwan) was completed. Various facilities were also completed such as the museum, the agriculture laboratory, the greenhouse, and other buildings for student services. In the same year, an experimental farm of about 1,680,000 pyeong was added to the facilities. In addition, the Science and Engineering Departments were equipped with laboratories and instruments. In December 1963, the Graduate School of Business Administration, the first of its kind in Korea, was established. In October 1965, Yu Chin-O retired after fifteen years of service as the fourth president of Korea University and was succeeded by Lee Chong-Woo as the fifth president. After 1966, Korea University continued to expand with a gradual increase in the number of departments within the College of Science and Engineering and in the College of Agriculture. The Graduate School of Education was also founded. More facilities, including the new annex buildings, the General Education Building (Kyoyangkwan), and the Mass Communication Building (Hongbokwan), were added.[6]\nIn October 1970, Kim Sang-Hyup, professor of political science, was appointed as the sixth president, succeeding Lee Chong-Woo who retired in September of that year. In December 1971, a major reorganization of Korea University took place, all Woosuk University colleges, including Medicine, Liberal Arts, and Sciences, Law and Economics, Junior College of Allied Health Sciences, as well as Woosuk University Hospital, was completely integrated into Korea University.[10]\nIn June 1972, the Business Administration Building (Kyoyangkwan) was completed to accommodate the College of Commerce and the Graduate School of Business Administration. In December of the same year, the college of Education was established.[6]\nIn April 1975, President Kim Sang-Hyup was succeeded by Cha Rak-Hoon who became the seventh president. In December 1976, the College of Commerce was renamed the College of Business Administration. The Graduate School of Food and Agriculture was established in January of the following year. In December 1977, the College of Science and Engineering was separated into the College of Science and the College of Engineering. In addition, the new Central Library, the largest of its kind in South Korea at that time, was opened in March 1978. In July 1983, Medical School and hospital were expanded and reorganized into the Korea University Medical Center, which then included four new hospitals: Haewha, Guro, Yeoju and Ansan. In September 1983, the Science Library opened as the Center for Science and Technology Research and was at that time the largest and most modern building on the campus. In June 2001, Korea University concluded a joint academic program with the University of British Columbia in Canada. The Korea University Lyceum was completed and SK Telecom made a significant contribution in the same month. In July, the Division of International Studies and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication were founded. In October, Korea University obtained ISO9001 authentication in all educational and administrative areas.[11]\n100th Anniversary[edit]\nIn 2005, Korea University celebrated its Centennial Anniversary of Foundation Day, May 5.[12]\nIn March the College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology and the College of Life and Environmental Sciences were integrated into the College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology. At the same time, the Junior College of Health Sciences was abolished and merged into the new highly developed College of Health Sciences.[6] Korea University is composed of twenty-two graduate schools as well as eighteen undergraduate schools and colleges. Additionally, there are eleven auxiliary facilities, including libraries, a museum, and a press office for public relations.[13][14]\nAcademics[edit]\nColleges and schools[15][edit]\nKorea University's 59 academic departments and programs are organized into 17 colleges and schools:\nDepartments and Programs[edit]\nInterdisciplinary Programs[edit]\nAdmissions Selectivity[edit]\nAdmissions decisions are based on the applicant's high school transcripts and scores on the South Korean College Scholastic Ability Test. For the freshman class entering in 2016, the overall admission rate was 5.13%.[17]\nRankings and Reputation[edit]\nIn 2021, the university was ranked 69th in the world.[30] In 2016\u201317, the university was ranked 16th in Asia by QS World University Rankings.[31] Also, in the 2014 QS World University Subject Rankings, the university's politics program, economics program, chemical engineering program, and communications program were all ranked within the top 50 in the world.[32]\nIn 2003, Korea University Law School students accounted for more than 15% of the nearly 900 people who passed the annual Korean bar examination.[33]\nThe business programs at Korea University obtained international certification by acquiring Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) certifications in both undergraduate and graduate levels and European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS).[34] Accordingly, in 2007, the Ministry of Education, after assessing domestic MBA programs, named Korea University as having the MBA program in South Korea.[35] In the 2015 Financial Times' EMBA Rankings, Korea University Business School's Executive MBA (E-MBA) program was ranked 27th in the world.[36]\nFrom 2003 to 2006, Euh Yoon-Dae, the current Chairman of President's Council on National Branding, Steering Committee of Korea Investment Corporation (KIC), and the former (15th) President of Korea University, drastically changed the image of Korea University, a change symbolized by the adoption of red wine over the traditional rice wine. He doubled the publication requirements required for faculty promotion and raised the ratio of the classes taught in English to 35% of all courses taught. He also required that core liberal arts classes be taught by full-time faculty and required every student except those in the Colleges of Engineering, Law, and Medicine to do a double major. He also signed academic exchange agreements with 172 universities overseas and dispatched 60% of administration staff to the world's top 100 universities for training.[37] Korea University also expanded its international-level facilities. It built the Centennial Memorial Samsung Hall, Hwajung Gymnasium, Tiger Plaza, and Hana Square, and also expanded educational and cultural spaces.[6]\nInternational Students[edit]\nThe overall number of international students is about 4,000.[38] Korea University offers English degree programs in the College of International Studies (CIS) and Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS).[39] International students can also apply toward other degree programs through the Office of International Affairs. However, the language of instruction is usually Korean.[40]\nResearch Institutes[41][edit]\nKorea University Sejong Campus[edit]\nKorea University Sejong Campus is Korea University's second campus. It was established in Jochiwon, Yeongi County(later annexed to Jochiwon District of Sejong City, the governmental capital of South Korea), South Korea in 1980. Korea University Sejong Campus is a leading research oriented one. The campus consists of the Biomedical Campus in Osong Bio-health technopolis established by Korea's Ministry of Health & Welfare, New Research Campus (provisional name) in Sejong City which is established as Korea's new government district (Sejong Special Self-Governing City) Six colleges and schools in Sejong Campus are part of the twenty schools of Korea University.\nHistory[edit]\nThe installation plan of Korea University Sejong Campus was approved on September 22 in 1979.\nAcademics[edit]\nColleges and schools[edit]\nCampus[edit]\nSeoul campus is divided into four subdivisions; Science and Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences, Medicine and Life Sciences, and Jeongneung. It is located in the greater Seoul area and boasts a population of over 20 million. Within a five-minute walk from the campus are an array of restaurants, bars, shops, and even a famous Buddhist temple. It takes about 20 minutes from some buildings of the main campus to some buildings on the science or medical campus on foot.[43]\nStudent activities[edit]\nClubs[edit]\nTraditions[edit]\nAthletics[edit]\nKorea University is a member of the Korea University Sports Federation (KUSF) and its men's football/soccer, men's basketball, baseball, and men's ice hockey teams participate in the KUSF U-League.[45] It has a historic athletic rivalry with the nearby Yonsei University which dates back to the Japanese occupation era.[46] Outside KUSF-sanctioned competitions, both institutions also compete in an annual \"friendship games\" across two days each fall in five team sports \u2013 football, basketball, baseball, ice hockey and rugby \u2013 a tradition dating back to the 1940s.\nKorea University's mascot and symbol is the tiger and its student-athletes are informally known as \"Tigers\".[47]\nPresidents[edit]\nThe following is a list of presidents of Korea University.[48]\nMedical center[edit]\nWith the opening as Kyoung-sung Women's Medical College in 1938,[52] the university's college of medicine was later renamed and annexed as Seoul Women's Medical College in 1948. Then, in 1967, it was renamed as Woosuk College of Medicine. Finally, the medical school merged with Korea University in 1971, and was officially renamed as Korea University College of Medicine. In 1983, the Korea University Medical Center (KUMC) was formed and its first director was inaugurated.[52] Since then, KUMC has been performing the duties as a university hospital, such as education, research, patient care, and voluntary work in world-disaster areas as well as disadvantaged areas in South Korea. Korea University Medical Center is a comprehensive medical institution that includes three hospitals (Anam, Guro, and Ansan), the College of Medicine, three graduate schools, ten laboratories, and several specialized centers. It also has acquired JCI certification, the second medical center in South Korea to do so.[53]\nScholarships[edit]\nKorea University offers scholarships, fellowships and awards under the auspices of the Korea University Foundation, established in 1905.[54] Close to 245 institutional scholarships, totaling more than 11.5 billion won, are available to Korea University students. Almost 90 percent of the admitted international students are awarded Korea University Scholarships. Scholarships are established as either endowed or restricted, in accordance with the wishes of the donor. Scholarships are awarded to students based on criteria such as matriculation status, school and department affiliation, financial need, academic achievement, grade point average and expected graduation date.[55]\nRivalry with Yonsei University[edit]\nThe rivalry between Korea University and Yonsei University, the country's top two private schools, regularly gains national attention. There is an annual fall sports festival between the two universities. Since 1956, the annual Korea\u2013Yonsei University Friendship Games comprises five events every year: Football, Rugby, Baseball, Basketball, and Ice Hockey.[56]\nThe history of the Yonsei\u2013Korea rivalry: Yeonhee College, the forerunner of Yonsei University, and Boseong College, the forerunner of Korea University participated in the fifth Jeonbok . It was the confrontation between the soccer team of Boseong professional school and the soccer team of Yeonhee professional school in the semi-finals of the eighth Jeonbuk Soccer Contest held in Kyungsung Stadium in 1927.[57]\nIn 2012, out of the five sports, Korea University won three (baseball, basketball, soccer) and lost two (ice hockey, rugby). In 2014, out of the five sports, Korea University won all of them, the first time ever in history.\nNotable people and alumni[edit]\nIn 2009, Korea University claimed approximately 280,000 living alumni.[58] Among the notable alumni of Korea University are prominent lawyers, physicians, engineers, researchers, Olympic athletes, and others who have gained both national and world fame in their respective fields. Korea University has produced many famous politicians, including the tenth President of the Republic of Korea, Lee Myung Bak, 20th Speaker of the Assembly , Chung Sye-kyun, and the 34th Mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon. Also, a recent survey of South Korea's Fortune 500 companies revealed that Korea University has produced the greatest number of CEOs of these Fortune 500 companies.[59]\nAfter graduating from the prestigious Waseda University in Japan, Kim Seong-su, who founded Korea University and served as the Vice President of Government of Korea, influenced the establishment of a close relationship between Korea University and Waseda University starting in 1973. From the 2010s, this partnership has offered rare dual degree programs at both the bachelor's and master's levels.[60]\nSee also[edit]\nNotes[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"
