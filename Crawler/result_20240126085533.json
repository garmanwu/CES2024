        "raw_content": "Nebula Genomics Review 2024 - In-depth Ancestry Report\nNebula Genomics Overview: Does 30x Whole Genome Sequencing Really Make a Difference?\nIn 2018, Nebula Genomics joined the DNA testing market with a single test addressing both ancestry and health. The company recently announced an upgrade: they\u2019ve started using 30x whole-genome sequencing for DNA analysis. This change indicates a more thorough examination of customers\u2019 DNA.\nUnlike many other DNA companies that only analyze approximately 2% of your DNA, focusing on specific genetic markers associated with particular traits, Nebula Genomics\u00a0sequence all 6.4 billion of your DNA base pairs, which is quite remarkable on its own. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Nebula Genomics takes it a step further by sequencing your entire DNA a staggering 30 times, ensuring utmost accuracy in their findings.\nI\u2019ve taken several DNA tests over time, so many that I\u2019ve honestly lost track! Naturally, Nebula Genomics was also on my list to evaluate. My objective was to verify if its unique features genuinely enhanced and elevated the testing process.\nIs Nebula Genomics the top pick for your DNA testing needs? Continue reading to uncover the results of my analysis.\nGet Started With Nebula Genomics\nHow Nebula Genomics Works\nAs I said, I\u2019ve taken a lot of genetic tests by now, so I\u2019m very used to collecting and mailing in samples of my DNA. In this respect, Nebula Genomics is exactly like most other companies.\nAfter that, you wait 8-10 weeks. (In my case it was 13.) Nebula Genomics will email you when your results are ready, and you log onto the company\u2019s website to view your report.\nI\u2019ll show you my report a little later.\nStart Your Journey With Nebula Genomics!\n4 Standout Features of Nebula Genomics\n1. 30x Whole Genome Sequencing\nThis is a sequencing method that provides a comprehensive analysis of your genetic makeup and covers both coding and non-coding regions. It uses Illumina technology and sequences a small saliva sample to provide high-depth coverage and accurate results. Since it sequences your entire genome 30 times, it can detect ancestry informative markers and help you identify more distant and admixed ancestry.\n2. Data Privacy\nNebula Genomics protects your genomic data by using advanced encryption and secure cloud storage. It also gives you control over how your data is used and the ability to revoke access or delete it entirely. This ensures peace of mind as you won\u2019t have to worry about potential misuse or mishandling of sensitive genetic information.\n3. Traits Report\nThe Traits Report does a cool thing \u2013 it looks into your genes to find out about your physical and behavioral traits. They\u2019ve got the lowdown based on the latest science. And guess what? They keep it fresh by updating it often, so you\u2019re getting the real deal.\nNow, here\u2019s why it\u2019s awesome: those findings help you know yourself better. Think about relationships and work choices \u2013 this info can be like a guide. And it\u2019s not just that, knowing about traits you\u2019ve inherited, like how tall you are or what color your eyes are, can also spill the beans on your ancestry and family history.\n4. The Nebula Research Library\nThe Nebula Research Library provides tailored genetic reports to deepen your understanding of your ancestry. It gathers data from more than 150 genome-wide association studies, equipping you with resources to explore research related to your lineage. The library enables you to examine specifics like your polygenic score and percentile rankings, investigate specific genetic variants, and trace the migratory journeys of your ancestors.\nGet Gold Standard DNA Testing With Nebula Genomics!\nWas It Worth the 13-Week Wait?\nWhen I sent Nebula Genomics my gene sample, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Among other things, I was under the impression that the company was going to give me a report on my ancestry\u2026but that wasn\u2019t the case. (Ancestry is \u201ccoming soon,\u201d Nebula says.)\nIt took me 13 weeks to receive my report. Granted, the company\u2019s processing may have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2026like everything else.\nTraits report\nWhat I did\u00a0get as part of my Nebula Genomics results was a report on my inherited traits \u2014 broken into these categories:\n(In addition to Traits, there are several other sections of my report that I\u2019ll get to later.)\nFor each Traits category, there are a number of traits you can explore. Here are Nebula\u2019s findings for me in the Appearance & Hormones section:\nBy the way, the items that Nebula includes in this category are very selective, don\u2019t you think? Why include just one\u00a0hormone? Why not include other physical traits like hair, skin, and eye color?\nBy way of comparison, 23andMe\u2019s DNA report includes 21 different characteristics\u00a0in this category. Interestingly, 23andMe\u2019s report concurs with Nebula Genomics about my earwax type and freckling.\nHere is what my Freckling report from Nebula says:\nAnd for the record, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t have much in the way of freckles. The ones I do\u00a0have are all concentrated on my left shoulder. Go figure.\nThe Behavior & Perception section of the traits report covers:\nLike many other DNA tests, Nebula Genomics\u2019 test found that I\u2019m likely to drink more caffeine than most people. Every other DNA test I\u2019ve taken has said the same thing. Guilty as charged.\nAlso, yes, I can\u00a0smell asparagus in pee. I don\u2019t care for cilantro. And Nebula\u2019s findings concerning these traits concur with other tests I\u2019ve taken.\nThis would be a good time to point out that Nebula Genomics, 23andMe, and Vitagene (just for example) all based their conclusions about my caffeine consumption on the same data: \u00a0on gene CYP1A2, under the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551, my genotype is AA, which is associated with faster caffeine metabolism.\nAdditionally, 23andMe looked at a second gene, AHR, which contains instructions for a protein that ramps up production of the CYP1A2 enzyme.\nNebula Genomics also looked at SNP rs2472297, which is located between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes. They say my CT genotype is strongly associated with increased daily caffeine consumption, but only by a modest amount (~0.2 cups per day).\nSo \u2014 all three companies based their conclusion about my caffeine consumption on slightly different factors. But they all reached the same conclusion.\nIn my opinion, Nebula, with its whole genomics approach, did not come up with a more meaningful and accurate conclusion about this trait than the other two companies.\nMy results in the Body & Athleticism category:\nHow do these findings compare to reality? My blood pressure is always nice and low. I\u2019m 5\u2019 11\u201d. I\u2019m extremely nearsighted (and also very myopic). I sunburn pretty easily, and I sleep very deeply but am prone to middle-of-the-night insomnia.\nIncidentally, 23andMe found that I\u2019m less\u00a0likely to be a deep sleeper, more\u00a0likely to be overweight, and am likely to have average or less-than-average movement during sleep.\nSo, there was some disagreement about these traits, and I don\u2019t know which company\u2019s methodology was more sound than the other\u2019s.\nLet\u2019s look at obesity.\nSo: Who\u2019s right? Whose methodology is best? I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m not overweight, for what it\u2019s worth.\nLastly, the Nutrition & Diet part of Nebula Genomics\u2019 report discusses\u2026\nEvery DNA test I\u2019ve taken agrees that I\u2019m unlikely to be lactose intolerant (and I\u2019m not lactose intolerant, for the record). They\u2019ve also all agreed that I\u2019m likely to be deficient in vitamins B12 and D.\nAnyway, aside from this report on my inherited traits, what else is included in my Nebula Genomics DNA report? After all \u2014 the company sequenced my whole genome. What else did it find? What are the implications for me?\nStart Your Journey With Nebula Genomics!\nNebula Library\nThis section of my genetics report is \u201ca curated repository of research publications and genomic discoveries! Check back regularly to find new publications and how they relate to your genomic data!\u201d Inside the library, you can read little gems like this:\nNow, I\u2019m not a geneticist, but I am slightly more educated about genetics than most people. And I can barely bring myself to read any of these articles. Even though they\u2019re about me, like this one on visual refractive errors (I have a ridiculous amount of myopia).\nThe article looks at literally hundreds of gene variants that have been associated with refractive errors, points out which of these variants I have, and indicates how significant the correlation with myopia is.\nIf I had hours and hours, I\u2019m sure I could find a lot of articles like this that could help me learn things about myself and my genetic traits. But I don\u2019t have that much time, and I doubt many of you do, either.\nGene Analysis\nThe Gene Analysis section of my Nebula Genomics report is powered by gene.iobio. \u201cThis gene analysis tool enables you to examine any gene in your genome and identify variants that may have a clinical significance,\u201d it says.\n\u201cTo get started, enter a gene name (e.g. BRCA2) into the search field in the navigation bar. In the panel on the left, you will then see a list of all genes that you searched for during a session. Click on a gene to examine it.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s cool. If I had a catalog of gene names in my head, I could look up all the ones that I know are meaningful and see what gene variants I have.\nBut, do I have a catalog of gene names in my head? No. I do not.\nSo I decided to search for FTO, a gene mentioned in my Vitagene report. Vitagene says that at SNP1421085 my genotype is CC, which has a fair degree of association with stress eating.\nHere\u2019s what I found at gene.iobio:\nIf I click on any of those circles, squares, or triangles, it tells me what SNP that is. But how do I find SNP 1421085? I can\u2019t figure it out for the life of me.\nBut in my defense, when I buy a DNA test, I expect the testing company to interpret my genes for\u00a0me. Because I don\u2019t know how to read this stuff. Do you?\nGenome Browser\nIn this part of my report, I can get a detailed look at each of my chromosomes. For example, here\u2019s my X chromosome:\nThe page says \u201cZoom in to see features.\u201d When I do that, I can see two parallel blue-and-white-striped lines that represent the two strands that make up that chromosome\u2019s double helix. And if I click on one of the lines, I get to see what I\u2019m looking at.\nApparently, I\u2019m looking at genes FGF16 and ATRX, and there\u2019s lots of data about where they start and stop on the X chromosome, which strand they\u2019re located on, and some other stuff that I can\u2019t even interpret. Fascinating\u2026if I knew what FGF16 and ATRX do.\nI could look it up, but it would be nice if the Genome Browser would tell me. It would also be nice if it told me what SNPs are involved, what genotypes I have, and what that says about me.\nBut people have an awful lot of genes, have you noticed? I could study my genome forever if I had the patience, and had any idea what I was looking at.\nBut I don\u2019t.\nNext, I once again searched for the gene FTO.\nApparently, it\u2019s located on chromosome 16 at positions 53, 703,156-54,122 and 941. Good to know! Can I locate SNP 1421085 somehow? I tried zooming in\u2026\nI have literally no idea what I\u2019m looking at or how to interpret it.\nSo, to summarize\u2026\nMy Nebula Genomics report contains four sections: Traits, Library, Gene Analysis, and Genome Browser.\nThe Traits section isn\u2019t terribly impressive. It doesn\u2019t tell me anything I haven\u2019t read in my other DNA reports, and where it disagrees with their conclusions, I don\u2019t know whether I should believe Nebula Genomics\u2019 findings over what the other reports said.\nAs for the Library, Gene Analysis, and Genome Browser sections\u2026I almost feel like I would need to be a geneticist in order to understand the information they contain and what it means for me.\nDo I feel like I got my money\u2019s worth? Keep reading.\nWhat\u2019s the Catch? The Mandatory Subscription!\nAt face value, Nebula Genomics\u2019 DNA test costs $649.00. That\u2019s a fair bit higher than comparable DNA tests from 23andMe ($99.00) or AncestryDNA($99.00).\nHowever, when you buy your test, you\u2019re also automatically enrolled in the Nebula Explore\u2122 Plan, a paid subscription service that promises you \u201cmultiple new reports every week, unlimited use of genome exploration tools, and premium support provided by geneticists.\u201d\nThat\u2019ll set you back $19.99 each month if you pay monthly (basically $240 a year), or $119.88 if you pay for a year at a time. Or you can get unlimited lifetime access for $300.\nWhen you buy your kit, by default you\u2019re charged $300 for unlimited lifetime access, so your total comes to $599.00. You have to actively select one of the other subscription plans in order to pay less.\nThe only way to have no subscription costs is to cancel your subscription after the fact. And if you do, you\u2019ll lose access to all your Nebula Genomics reports! (You retain access to your genomic data, and you can download it anytime.)\nTo me, this is the fishiest thing about Nebula Genomics. With pretty much all other DNA companies, once you\u2019ve paid for your test, you can continue to access your reports online forever, with no restrictions. With this one, that\u2019ll cost you extra.\nNebula explains the mandatory subscription service by saying that the reports it gives you are dynamic and evolving, so you could theoretically find out new information about yourself every month.\nIf you\u2019re not interested in paying for that privilege, you could just pay $19.99 for one month and then cancel after you\u2019ve looked at your whole report. Or, you could download your genetic data in various formats \u2014 CRAM, CRAI, FASTQ, VCF, or TBI \u2014 whatever those are. But then what do you do with the data?\nStill, when this company claims that it\u2019s brought the cost of whole-genome sequencing to (just) below the $300 mark, and then it charges you basically double that so you can retain lifetime access to your reports, that\u2019s a huge bait and switch in my book. And it puts Nebula Genomics in the same price ballpark as its competitors in the 30x whole genome sequencing arena.\nBut if you put aside that mandatory subscription, my other issue with the pricing of this DNA test is that it didn\u2019t give me much information I can understand.\nThe Traits part of my DNA report is straightforward and accessible\u2026but for less money, 23andMe gave me similar information and also told me all about my ancestry, my genetic health risks, my likelihood of being a carrier of various hereditary diseases, and a lot more.\nThe Library, Gene Analysis, and Genome Browser sections of my Nebula report give me a lot of additional information \u2014 but to me, it\u2019s so esoteric that trying to go through it just makes me feel stupid.\nIf I was an actual geneticist, these sections might make me giddy with excitement. But I\u2019m not.\nNebula Genomics accepts Discover, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express cards \u201cand more.\u201d\nExplore Your DNA With Nebula Genomics!\nThe Answers I Received Were Quick and Clear\u2026But Not Enlightening\nIn writing this review, I had a couple of questions that I couldn\u2019t easily find answers to on the Nebula Genomics website (including on the company\u2019s FAQ page or its blog) \u2014 or anywhere else.\nSo I submitted this inquiry via the website\u2019s contact form (which seems to be the only way of reaching Nebula Genomics to ask a question):\nHere\u2019s the answer I received via email about an hour later (which is pretty quick as such things go):\n(I love it when companies call me \u201cStern\u201d! LOL)\nSeriously, this is a pretty clear and honest answer. But if the company has been doing DNA testing since 2018, it should have at least some record of how many customers it has tested.\nThen the email continues with a lengthy sales pitch (5 paragraphs) explaining why 30x Whole Genome Sequencing is so much better than other commercially available DNA testing methods.\nIn my next contact request, I asked how many geographic regions Nebula Genomics divides the world into when estimating your ethnicity. For instance, MyHeritage DNA only recognizes 42 distinct regions; 23andMe recognizes more than 1500. The more distinct world populations a DNA company compares your samples to, the more accurately it should be able to pinpoint the ethnicities you have in your background.\nThe reply:\nSetting aside for the moment that ancestry isn\u2019t even part of my Nebula Genomics DNA report yet (\u201cDeep Ancestry\u201d is \u201cComing Soon,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website)\u2026I\u2019ve taken the Family Tree DNA ancestry test, and I wasn\u2019t impressed!\nFamily Tree DNA uses 24 global \u201cpopulation clusters\u201d to determine your ethnicities. See the list below.\nYou might think that by clicking on each plus sign, you would see the population cluster broken down into smaller components. But no. You just get a description of how that cluster is defined.\nFor example, \u201cThe Northeast Asia cluster encompasses present-day China, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Siberia, and Kazakhstan.\u201d But do you realize how genetically and ethnically diverse the populations in that region are?\nSigh.\nGreat If You\u2019re a Trained Geneticist. Unimpressive Otherwise.\nAfter charging you a staggering price, Nebula Genomics doesn\u2019t deliver much information that a person like me can understand. The Traits section was the only part that spelled out for me how my genetic heritage may affect who I am today.\nBut in that regard, I felt I got a lot more insights and value out of my DNA tests from 23andMe, MyHeritage DNA, AncestryDNA, and Vitagene, to name a few.\nAs for the Library, Gene Analysis, and Genome Browser sections of my Nebula Genomics DNA report, they would probably be of enormous interest to someone who can understand and appreciate them. But that\u2019s not me.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes Nebula Genomics do genome sequencing for free?\nA few years ago, Nebula Genomics would let anyone take its DNA test at no charge \u2014 in exchange for answering a number of health questions, and then allowing the company to share customers\u2019 DNA information with genetic researchers.\nBut that\u2019s no longer the case. Currently, a test from Nebula Genomics costs $649.00 \u00a0\u2014 plus an ongoing subscription fee.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve already had your DNA tested by either 23andMe or AncestryDNA, you can download your raw data from those companies, upload it to the Nebula Genomics website, and then receive a free DNA report.\nThis report is probably not equivalent in scope to the report you\u2019d get from using Nebula Genomics for your test. Most likely it\u2019s just intended to give you a taste of what you\u2019d get from a paid Nebula Genomics report and subscription.\nCustomers who\u2019ve already bought and registered a Nebula Genomics test kit aren\u2019t able to upload their raw data from 23andMe or AncestryDNA.\nAre there any other companies that do whole genome sequencing?\nYes. In fact, there are a few other companies that now offer 30x whole genome sequencing, just like Nebula Genomics \u2014 notably Dante Labs\u00a0and Veritas Genetics. Their DNA test kits start at $599\u2026which is exactly what you\u2019d pay to get a Nebula Genomics test plus a lifetime subscription.\nDoes Nebula Genomics share my information with third parties?\nThe only third parties with which Nebula Genomics ever shares people\u2019s data are non-profit foundations, academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and other entities conducting genetic research.\nAnd Nebula Genomics gives you three options as to how and whether your (anonymized) DNA information may be shared. One option is to let it be shared with any researchers who want it \u2014 and then you can earn money if it\u2019s used.\nAnother option is to make Nebula Genomics ask your permission every time they\u2019d like to share your data \u2014 and if you agree, you\u2019d be compensated if your data is used. Or finally, you can deny the company permission to ever share your genetic information under any circumstances.\nCan I get my whole genome sequenced?\nYes, that\u2019s exactly what Nebula Genomics does. It sequences all 6.4 billion base pairs of your DNA \u2014 as compared to most commercial DNA testing companies, which do genotyping \u2014 basically only looking for select genetic markers relevant to the traits they\u2019re investigating. So these tests really only examine about 2% of your genome.\nAnd in fact, Nebula Genomics sequences your whole genome 30 times\u00a0\u2014 which is the current gold standard for accuracy in genetic sequencing.\nThe advantage of whole-genome sequencing is that it allows companies like Nebula Genomics to detect certain very rare details that genotyping tests don\u2019t even look for \u2014 such as markers for extremely rare diseases, for example. This could allow you to find out something about yourself that could have huge health implications, so you\u2019d be able to seek appropriate treatment.\nAlso, as more and more genetic correlations are discovered in the future, Nebula Genomics might discover that you have more markers that didn\u2019t seem meaningful originally. But that\u2019s only possible because they\u2019ve already mapped your whole genome.\nWhat is genome sequencing?\nA person\u2019s DNA consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes, each of which contains millions of individual base pairs \u2014 which are basically rungs in the spiral \u201cladder\u201d of each chromosome.\nVarious combinations of base pairs together form genes, which regulate your cells and determine all of your inherited traits.\nGenome sequencing involves reading entire segments of your chromosomes from end to end like a book, to understand what makes you the person you are (genetically, at least).\nWhole-genome sequencing means reading your entire genome, all 6.4 billion base pairs of it, in order to understand all the minute ways in which you\u2019re unique.\nPeople also read\nNebula Genomics User Reviews\nUsers reviews are not verified\nWrite Review on Nebula Genomics\nPlease enter your email address to submit your review\nReply to {{name}}"

        "raw_content": "Nebula Genomics DNA Testing Review 2024\nIs This Whole Genome Sequencing Test Worth It?\nIn a Nutshell\npros\ncons\nTypes of Tests and Kits You Can Get from Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics specializes in DNA testing, and it offers three packages.\nStandard DNA Test\nAlthough it\u2019s Nebula Genomics\u2019 simplest DNA test, this stands out to me as an excellent option if you want to find out more about your ancestry. It decodes specific genetic markers and comes with a basic ancestry report based on autosomal DNA. This kit comes in at just $99, making it a very attractive option.\nDeep DNA Test\nThe Deep DNA Test ($299) offers full genetic sequencing and generates nearly 100GB of genetic data. You can use this information to find out more about your genetic predisposition to specific health conditions, any genetic mutations you have, and more.\nI also like the in-depth ancestry report, which provides detailed information about your roots based on mitochondrial and Y chromosomal DNA.\nUltra Deep DNA Test\nNebula Genomics\u2019 high-end Ultra Deep DNA Test costs $999, but it provides ultra-high-resolution genomic sequencing. It\u2019s a little over the top for the average person, but it offers excellent value for money if you want to take a closer look at your genetics.\nIt comes with full access to various genome exploration tools, and it includes an even more detailed ancestry report than the Deep DNA Test.\nOther Features at Nebula Genomics\nAlong with its powerful DNA testing service, Nebula Genomics enables you to upload raw DNA data for analysis.\nDNA Upload and Analysis\nI particularly like that Nebula Genomics offers tools to help you analyze existing DNA data. Creating a free account will enable you to upload DNA data from Ancestry.com or 23andMe tests.\nYou will have access to a smart DNA expansion tool and a free DNA analysis, which provides information about more than 30 genetic traits. However, you will need a premium subscription to access a more detailed analysis.\nHow much does Nebula Genomics cost?\nOne thing I don\u2019t like about Nebula Genomics is its unclear prices.\nAlong with the test price, you will have to pay a fee for Nebula Explore Reporting if you want access to anything other than raw DNA data. But you will get free shipping with all orders, and your Nebula Explore subscription doesn\u2019t begin until you receive your DNA results. There\u2019s also a lifetime license for Nebula Explore if you want ongoing updates and access to analysis tools.\nHow much does Nebula Genomics cost?\nOne thing I don\u2019t like about Nebula Genomics is its unclear prices.\nAlong with the test price, you will have to pay a fee for Nebula Explore Reporting if you want access to anything other than raw DNA data.

For example, the cheapest Standard test comes in at $99, which is more affordable than many of the other leading DNA test kits on the market.\nHow to Get Started With Nebula Genomics?\nThe Sign-up process\nTo get started with Nebula Genomics, you will need to purchase a DNA test kit. Once you receive it, you can use the Register Kit button on the top right of the company website to create a new account. Simply enter your Kit ID Number (which is included in your kit) and a small amount of personal information, and hit the submit button.\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nNebula Genomics kits include the following:\nTwo cheek swabs\nTwo sample vials\nPlastic pouch for returning samples\nPostage-paid return envelope\nStep-by-step instructions\nHow to Collect your DNA Samples\nNebula Genomics uses a simple cheek swab self-collection kit. The hardest thing about it is making sure that you don\u2019t eat or drink anything in the hour before you collect your samples.\nGet started by carefully removing the cheek swabs from their plastic packaging. Rub the first swab on the inside of one cheek for 45 seconds before placing the head of the swab in the first sample vial and securing the lid. Repeat the process with the second swab on your other cheek.\nOnce you\u2019ve collected your samples, you will need to place them in the included plastic pouch. Place this in the postage-paid return envelope, and mail it back to Nebula Genomics at the specified address.\nFull instructions are included with each kit outlining exactly how to complete each step of the sample collection process. It\u2019s important to follow these carefully to reduce the risk of contamination and poor-quality DNA results.\nGetting The Results\nOnce you\u2019ve returned your DNA samples, the Nebula Genomics team will have them processed and sequenced. Nebula Genomics says your results should be available within eight to 10 weeks, but a few people I\u2019ve spoken to have reported slightly longer wait times of up to 14 weeks.\nYou will receive an email when your results are ready to view, and the raw DNA data will be available for download or further analysis through your Nebula Genomics account. Note that you have to register your kit before you can receive any results.\nHow Nebula Genomics Protects Your Privacy\nNebula Genomics is a privacy-centric company that takes pride in securing user data. Some information may be provided to partner laboratories, and data will be shared with other third parties if you elect to participate in scientific research. Apart from this, the only time Nebula Genomics will release your data is if it is legally obliged to.\nNebula Genomics doesn't sell or license any personal or genetic data.\nNebula Genomics doesn't provide data to insurance companies.\nUsers can delete their data from Nebula Genomics at any time.\nHelp and Support\nHow to Contact Nebula Genomics\nThe only way to contact Nebula Genomics is by filling in the online contact form. I sent a support request and received an answer in just under three hours. However, I would have liked to see live chat and/or phone support options for when you just need a quick answer to a simple question.\nAre FAQ Pages Available on Nebula Genomics?\nYes, Nebula Genomics has an in-depth FAQ page containing numerous questions and in-depth answers. But if you can\u2019t find the information you\u2019re looking for there, you will have to contact the support team. There is a support site, but it has under 10 articles, and they are outdated.\nHow Nebula Genomics Compares to Other DNA Testing Companies\nNebula Genomics\n23andMe\nInsideTracker\nLivingDNA\nRelationship\n\u2713\nAncestry\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nHealth\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\nPrice Range\n$99 to $999\n$99 to $199\n$249\n$79 to $149\nBest For\nComplete genomic sequencing\nAdvanced ancestry testing\nHealth and wellness testing\nBudget-friendly DNA testing\nNebula Genomics Vs 23andMe\n23andMe offers one of the most powerful ancestry testing services on the market, and its basic kit costs the same as Nebula Genomics\u2019 ($99). It comes with a neat family tree builder and a selection of other genealogy tools, and it presents as an excellent option for all-around family research. However, Nebula Genomics' full genomic sequencing stands out as much more powerful on a pure DNA testing front.\nNebula Genomics Vs InsideTracker\nInsideTracker is a personal health company offering DNA testing for various health and wellness traits. Its DNA test costs $249, which is slightly cheaper than Nebula Genomics\u2019 Deep DNA Test, and it delivers information about a selection of genetic markers. InsideTracker is an attractive option if you are purely interested in genetics and health, but Nebula Genomics stands out as a more powerful all-around choice.\nNebula Genomics Vs LivingDNA\nLivingDNA offers competitively-priced DNA testing solutions for ancestry and wellbeing. There\u2019s a family tree builder and a selection of other tools. However, LivingDNA\u2019s results are a little simple when compared to Nebula Genomics\u2019, and I\u2019d only recommend it if you\u2019re looking for a true budget option.\nIs Nebula Genomics Worth It?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a powerful DNA testing solution, Nebula Genomics\u2019 Deep and Ultra Deep tests present as attractive options. I particularly like the sheer amount of genetic information that you will get with a test, and there are options for everyone.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019d suggest having a closer look at Nebula Genomics if you\u2019re interested in delving deeper into your DNA to research your ancestry and understand your genetic predispositions.\nYes, Nebula Genomics is one of the most trustworthy DNA testing companies that I\u2019ve seen. It places a strong emphasis on privacy and clearly states that your data won\u2019t ever be shared with or sold to any third parties.\nWhole genome sequencing involves mapping the entire DNA sequence of a person\u2019s genetic code. This can be particularly useful if you\u2019re looking for information about genetic predispositions, health conditions, and more. Nebula Genomics offers some of the most attractive whole genome sequencing options that I\u2019ve seen.\nNebula Genomics charges a quarterly or annual subscription fee for access to the Nebula Explore toolkit. This includes a suite of tools that you can use to analyze your genetic data as well as various custom reports and other information. If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to your raw genetic data, but all analysis and other information will be lost.\nVery few health insurance policies will include cover for whole genome sequencing. Even when DNA testing is covered with a doctor\u2019s recommendation, whole genome sequencing generally won\u2019t be paid for by your health insurance provider.\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 - 2024 Natural Intelligence Ltd.

        "raw_content": "Nebula Genomics Review: Is Whole Genome Sequencing Really Worth It?\nOverview\nNebula Genomics offers whole genome sequencing, weekly DNA reports, and ancestry analysis. Nebula DNA sequencing and reports cost between $149-999 depending on which package you opt for.\nAbout Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics was founded by an experienced genomics scientist named Professor Church and his students Kamal Obbad and Dennis Grishin in 2016. The company is based in California. Their goal is to enable users to share genomic data safely in order to generate large datasets which can be used to advance the science of human genetics.\nNebula Genomics Products and Features Review\nThe core product of Nebula Genomics is whole genome sequencing with up to 100X sequencing depth allowing them to attain high accuracy DNA sequencing data. You can also subscribe to their research library, Nebula Explore, which allows you to compare your DNA to scientific literature in order to generate risk scores for certain health conditions.\nNebula also offers deep genetic ancestry which utilizes data in your Y chromosome and mitochondria to give you the most accurate ancestral information.\nNebula Genomics Reports Review\nThe reports in the Nebula Explore research library are laid out based on individual research studies. Each report is composed of information about genes from the findings from particular studies. These reports are updated weekly with new research articles, so if you hold an active subscription to Nebula Explore then you have access to new information weekly.\nSee below an example of a report on anxiety from Nebula Explore:\nKeep in mind that Nebula Genomics only analyzes a few SNPs per report. For comparison, the SelfDecode Anxiety DNA Wellness Report analyzes over 800,000 genetic variants to provide your genetic predisposition score and personalized recommendations to help you optimize your health. You can upload your DNA to SelfDecode for free to get started.\nAll of the reports contain a general overview of the subject and the study along with an interesting fact about the subject. This section also contains your polygenic risk score (your percentile) relative to other Nebula Genomics users, however, this score is not necessarily indicative of how this condition is relative to your health.\nFollowing this general overview of the selected study, you will have access to a table which lays out the genetic findings of the study along with your genotype to inform you whether you are at an increased or decreased risk of exhibiting the trait. See an example of this table below:\nWhilst this chart can be informative, the terms used are fairly scientific and may not be as easy to understand for the average person who has little knowledge of how genetics studies work. Nebula also provides links to additional information on the topic at the bottom of each report.\nYou can also access mini-reports on several well established genetic traits, which include a SNP, a summary and a link to the study. However, these reports don\u2019t contain any recommendations on how to counteract any of your genetic predispositions.\nThe reports look at four types of traits: appearance & hormones, behavior & perception, body & athleticism, and nutrition & diet. The mini-report below for example is about how you handle nicotine:\nNebula Genomics Ancestry Review\nNebula Genomics ancestry offering is a fairly recent addition. They offer in depth ancestry reporting based on Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. You can access your ancestry report by navigating to the ancestry review and selecting the My Data option. This will provide you with a breakdown of your ancestral heritage as a percentage based on different regions from around the world. See below an example of this report:\nNebula Genomic Oral Microbiome Report Review\nAs well as providing your own DNA, Nebula also provides you with a report on the bacteria which live in your mouth. They do this using the same technology used to generate your DNA, but instead generate the data for the bacteria in your saliva DNA sample.\nThis is useful as the oral microbiome has been linked to conditions like Irritable Bowel Disease, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Your data is provided in the format shown below.\nYou are given a percentile showing how your oral microbiome compares to other users along with information from curated studies about how your oral microbiome may be linked to particular conditions, however, bear in mind this is not designed in any way to be a diagnostic tool.\nCost of Nebula Genomics\nIn order to fully utilize Nebula\u2019s research library, you will need to have whole genome sequencing data which they provide in three separate packages.\nThe basic package doesn\u2019t sequence all of your DNA. The only difference between the 30X and 100X packages is how sure you can be about the accuracy of your data.\nYou should bear in mind that Nebula Genomics will not pre-pay your shipping outside of the USA, meaning you will have to cover the costs of shipping your sample to Hong Kong.\nOnce you have received your genetic data, you will have a 14-day free trial of the Nebula Genomics reporting service; however, after this trial, you will have to pay $10+ per month or $200 for lifetime access to this service.\nOnce your data is generated, you are able to download it and utilize this data with other services if you don\u2019t want to take this subscription.\nNebula also accepts raw DNA data upload from other service providers.\nIs Whole Genome Sequencing Worth It?\nThe main question when it comes to whether to use Nebula Genomics for your DNA sequencing is whether or not it\u2019s worth paying for whole genome sequencing, and the simple answer is no.\nCurrently, whole genome sequencing costs a lot more than your standard DNA sequencing service used by companies like 23andMe and SelfDecode, however, these companies are able to use complex algorithms to generate variations of millions of genetic variants.\nWhole genome sequencing is not currently mainstream, which means you won\u2019t get as many benefits from this data, like being able to upload it to other services, as you would from more typical and cheaper ~$99 kits which are widely used by a range of DNA service providers.\nWhilst the amount of data generated by whole genome sequencing is unmatched, the reference data to compare your own data to is lacking. There also isn\u2019t a lot of information to be gained from large parts of our DNA as the science simply isn\u2019t that far ahead. However, having this data for the future may be useful.\nWhilst this data may come in handy further down the line as the technology progresses, it doesn\u2019t necessarily represent value for money in 2023.\nHealth Recommendations from Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics offers a great deal of literature for customers to compare their genetic data to, which allows them to identify whether they are predisposed to a specific condition or trait. However, this is as far as their health information goes.\nUnfortunately whilst customers may be able to identify that they are genetically predisposed to be at a greater risk of a particular health condition, they aren\u2019t provided with any further information on what may increase or decrease their risk. Nebula does not offer users personalized recommedations based on their results.\nThis is quite a large gap in the information they provide, as it can be quite discomforting to know you are at risk of certain negative health conditions.\nReview of Nebula Genomics Privacy & Data Security\nNebula Genomics stores their customers\u2019 data using blockchain technology, which you may have heard of before, as this is the same technology that is used for cryptocurrency. Nebula claims that by storing their users\u2019 data this way, it makes it more secure in the event of any data breach.\nNebula also claims to offer \u201canonymous genetic sequencing\u201d. What this means is that they allow you to pay for their services anonymously using cryptocurrency or a pre-paid credit/debit card, sign up to their site anonymously, browse their site anonymously using a VPN and ship anonymously to a location of your choice.\nWhilst this process can be anonymous, Nebula Genomics does also share all of the data they process with researchers, however, this is also done so anonymously.\nAlternatives to Nebula Genomics\nDepending on what aspect of genetic testing you\u2019re interested in, there are alternatives to Nebula Genomics.\nOne alternative to Nebula Genetics that provides insights into your health and ancestry is SelfDecode.\nSelfDecode not only helps you identify your genetic health predispositions, but their wellness reports also include personalized recommendations to counteract specific problematic genetic variants, giving you the best in precision medicine.\nSelfDecode uses predictive algorithms to analyze around 83 million genetic variants (up to 1 million+ per wellness report), giving you the most accurate health & ancestry data based on your genetics.\nYou can upload your DNA file or get a SelfDecode DNA kit. For users who need a DNA kit, SelfDecode offers two options:\nWhen it comes to ancestry, SelfDecode in-depth ethnicity percentage breakdown, as well as a color-coded map that can help you easily discover where you\u2019re from. You\u2019ll be able to trace your maternal lineage back through the ages, learning where they started in the world, and the journey that they took to get to where you are today. Ancestry Insights is only available with a SelfDecode DNA kit.\nTo get started, you can upload your DNA for free to SelfDecode to get access to wellness and traits reports & recommendations to help you take control of your health.\nComparisons\nPlans from $99-$249\nNebula Genomics Reviews\nTrustpilot \u2013 4.1 of 5 stars\nOverall the reviews of Nebula Genomics on Trustpilot are positive, however, there are two relatively frequent complaints being that the test results took longer to arrive than expected and that the reports are difficult to gain useful information from.\nBetter Business Bureau \u2013 3 of 5 stars\nThere are only 5 reviews for Nebula Genomics on the BBB, and the theme of these reviews is relatively similar to Trustpilot, however, the Nebula Genomics account on BBB has refuted the negative reviews.\nTakeaway\nNebula Genomics brings whole genome sequencing technology to the consumer market. However, a lot of the information can\u2019t currently be used to gain useful insights into your health or ancestry. This means that whilst you may gain some benefit from this type of data in the future, currently the value for money isn\u2019t quite there.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best value for money in ancestry or health reporting now, rather than looking to pay a premium for data that may have more uses in the future, then you may be better suited looking elsewhere.\nA service like SelfDecode can offer cutting-edge health and ancestry insights. If health reports are what interest you, SelfDecode provides personalized genetic insights and recommendations to optimize your health. SelfDecode\u2019s platform uses AI and machine learning to accurately predict and analyze up to 83 million SNPs from a typical DNA test.\nWith Ancestry Insights from SelfDecode you\u2019ll discover your ancestry composition, mitochondrial ancestry, and other detailed reports (only available with the SelfDecode DNA kit).\nIf you already had your DNA tested, you can upload your file to SelfDecode for free to discover your genetic predispositions and personalized health recommendations.\nRelated Articles\nAbout the Author\nRATE THIS ARTICLE\nFDA Compliance\nThe information on this website has not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration or any other medical body.

There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200218005402/en/\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\nToday, most direct-to-consumer genetic tests produce limited information due to the use of outdated technology. In contrast, whole-genome sequencing at 30x coverage accurately reads out over 6 billion letters in the human genome. This generates a thousand-fold more information, enabling more comprehensive reporting on traits and ancestry. However, until now, the cost of whole-genome sequencing made it inaccessible to most people. To bring the cost down, Nebula Genomics has partnered with global genomics leader BGI Group, leveraging its MGI DNBSEQ T-Series high throughput sequencing technology and its global network of sequencing centers. Nebula Genomics is now excited to offer 30x whole-genome sequencing for $299 \u2013 a more than a two-fold price reduction.\n\u201cFor the past 30 years, we've been working towards making personal whole genome sequencing affordable and accurate. Today, we have a big step towards this goal, reducing the cost of 30x Whole-Genome Sequencing to less than $300 and making it available to people around the globe,\u201d said George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Nebula Genomics.\nIn addition to offering the most affordable whole-genome sequencing, Nebula Genomics seeks to address the mounting concerns over genetic data privacy that have slowed down the growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market. To this end, Nebula Genomics is building a secure data management platform that combines blockchain-enabled transparency with privacy-preserving computing. This technology enables Nebula Genomics users to benefit from affordable personal genome sequencing without risking their privacy.\nIndividuals who purchase 30x whole-genome sequencing from Nebula Genomics will retain full control of their genomic data, receive weekly updated reports based on the latest scientific discoveries, get an in-depth ancestry analysis, and become empowered to explore their data using browser-based genome discovery tools.\nAbout Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics\u2019 mission is to usher in the era of personal genomics by providing access to affordable whole-genome sequencing and creating technology to protect genomic data privacy.

        "raw_content": "Nebula Genomics Review: Is a genome deep-dive worth it?\nOverview\nPros\nCons\nAbout Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics was founded in 2016 in California by Professor George Church and Harvard students Kamal Obbad and Dennis Grishin.\nProfessor Church is an experienced researcher in genomics. Currently, co-founders Kamal Obbad and Dennis Grishin are graduate students in medical school at Stanford and Harvard, respectively.\nNebula Genomics raised 4.3M in funding in October 2018 from ten venture capital firms. Their initial goal was to offer whole genome sequencing at a much lower price point than was standard at the time.\nReview of Nebula Genomics Products & Features\nNebula\u2019s primary offering is its whole genome sequencing which analyzes all potential variations in an individual\u2019s DNA. Users have three options of DNA testing to choose from:\nThey also offer a subscription to Nebula Explore, their research library, which compares your DNA to scientific research and supplies risk scores for certain conditions or symptoms.\nNebula Genomics users also get access to \u201cDeep Genetic Ancestry\u201d. In collaboration with FamilyTreeDNA, they will look at your Y chromosome (for males) and mitochondrial DNA to provide a more complete analysis of your ancestry.\nReview of Nebula Genomics Reports\nNebula Genomics organizes their reporting by research study. Each report consists of information about genes that are linked to certain characteristics or conditions based on the findings of a particular study.\nTheir reports are updated weekly with new research. As long as you pay for their monthly subscription, you can log in every week to view what new studies have been added.\nFor example, here is a report detailing a recent study (Orthofer, 2020) that examined five genetic variants associated with thinness.\nIn each report, they include an overview of the study and a fun fact. In this example, they explain that the researchers found that certain genetic variants predispose thinness. They also tell us that underweight individuals often lack nutrients.\nIncluded below is the chart that is at the end of every report. It tells the user the allele associated with the characteristic in question for each SNP, the odds ratio, the frequency of this allele, its statistical significance, and their own genotype and its accuracy (if available).\nThis chart can be difficult to understand for the average user who has little to no knowledge about how genetics work. It is not easy to determine what the values in the chart mean. The polygenic risk score at the beginning of the report (the percentile value) tells you where you stand in relation to other users but not what that means for your health. More work could be done to make these results easier to interpret.\nThey provide additional resources at the bottom of each report that contain basic information about the topic being discussed.\nNebula Genomics also provides mini \u201creports\u201d on a variety of common and well-established genetic traits, such as whether you are likely to snack between meals.\nThey look at four categories of traits: appearance & hormones, behavior & perception, body & athleticism, and nutrition & diet.\nFor example, this mini \u201creport\u201d tells the user about their nicotine response:\nThey provide the associated gene, the relevant SNP, a short summary, and a link to the research paper used.\nThese traits are fun to look through but there is no guidance about what to do with these conclusions and most of them have little impact on daily life.\nBecause each report is based on a single study, the number of genetic variants analyzed per report can be limited. In the example above, the Nebula Genomics \u201cThinness\u201d report analyzed 5 variants associated with thinness. For comparison, the SelfDecode Weight Wellness Report looks at over 455,000 genetic variants related to weight and gives personalized recommendations based on DNA.\nCost of Nebula Genomics\nThe cost for the initial 30x whole genome sequencing needed to properly access Nebula\u2019s research library is $299 plus shipping. The 100x WGS costs $999, while the more affordable 0.4 WGS is $99.\nIt is important to note that if you live outside of the United States, they will not provide you with prepaid shipping materials and you will have to cover the return shipping costs for your kit to Hong Kong.\nThey have a 14-day free trial for their reporting service. After 14 days, you will need to pay a subscription fee of $10 \u2013 $20 per month to access any reports. Nebula also offers a lifetime access plan starting at $150 \u2013 $200.\nYou can always download your DNA file for free if you have paid for the whole genome sequencing. You can also upload a DNA file for free from another service to Nebula to receive a limited version of what you would get out of their whole genome sequencing option.\nIs Whole Genome Sequencing Worth It?\nNot yet.\nWhole genome sequencing is more expensive than SNP chip kits that you would get from 23andme and SelfDecode, which test up to a million SNPs generally. Plus, with a process known as imputation, you can infer the variations of many more SNPs than is sequenced.\nFor example, SelfDecode uses AI and machine learning to accurately predict and analyze up to 83 million genetic variants from a typical DNA file. Each report from SelfDecode\u00a0 looks at an average of 1 million genetic variants, which is thousands more than what Nebula analyzes in their individual reports.\nWhole genome sequencing analysis is not really being done in a significant way by any company as of 2021, so you wouldn\u2019t be getting significant benefits from it. The SNP kits provide quite a lot of information for only $99.\nIn addition, current whole genome kits don\u2019t actually test all variants, as a result of the way they are sequenced. For example, certain variants related to Huntington\u2019s Disease wouldn\u2019t be picked up on a regular 30X Whole Genome Sequencing. What this means is that you may want to sequence your whole genome again in the future (for \u2018longer reads\u2019).\nHealth Recommendations from Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics has a significant library of scientific research to compare its customers\u2019 genetic data to. This allows the customer to see how their genes connect to a wide variety of conditions and symptoms based on well-sourced and curated research.\nHowever, Nebula Genomics really falls short when it comes to interpreting this data for the user. If you are unfamiliar with genomics, it is difficult to reach conclusions about how the information they give you about your genes will impact your daily life.\nTheir reports tell you where you stand when it comes to particular research findings on genetics but then stop there. However, they do not tell you how to become healthier based on the information.\nThis is a missed opportunity to empower the user to improve upon their quality of life using information about their personal genetic risk to make lifestyle recommendations. Our lifestyle and environment play a very important role in how our genes impact our lives and Nebula fails to address this for their users in a meaningful way.\nNebula\u2019s service is great for comparing your own genes directly to scientific studies, but there is a noticeable lack of information that has practical implications for the average person.\nReview of Nebula Genomics Privacy & Data Security\nNebula Genomics places significant emphasis on data privacy and security, stating that they provide \u2018Privacy First Genomics\u2019. They store your data using blockchain technology, which is the same technology that facilitates the use of cryptocurrency. They say that this makes you far less vulnerable in the event of a security breach.\nThe company advertises that they offer anonymous genetic sequencing. They will allow you to pay using cryptocurrency, use a VPN, and ship to a separate pick-up location to maintain complete anonymity.\nNebula Genomics also share their entire library of genetic data with researchers in order to further the science of genomics. The data is all shared anonymously and only with your explicit permission.\nThe company sends users\u2019 cheek-swab samples to a BGI laboratory in Hong Kong, China.\nPartnerships\nNebula Genomics has gone down a similar path as 23andMe has and has partnered up with the pharmaceutical giant Merck in order to sell their consumer\u2019s data and monetize it.\nThis link between pharma companies and genomics companies isn\u2019t without controversy. Data sharing transparency has been a big conversation topic in the field, with big names in politics including Senator Chuck Schumer raising a red flag about data sharing practices.\nSelfDecode vs Nebula Genomics\nComparisons\nSelfDecode\nNo\nGenes & genetic variants analyzed\nWGS, health and fitness reporting, genetic health risk\nRaw data access\n$670\nNebula Genomics Reviews\nTrustpilot \u2013 261 Customer Average Rating of 4.2 of 5 stars\nReviewers on Trustpilot are generally positive about Nebula Genomics but there are two common complaints: a longer than advertised turnaround time for test results and reporting that can be difficult to gain useful insights from.\nProduct Hunt \u2013 3.7 of 5 stars\nThe reviews on Product Hunt are similar to those from Trustpilot. Some customers appreciate the detailed research that Nebula Genomics lays out for its users, but others find it hard to apply to everyday life.\nRead what people are saying about Nebula Genomics on Twitter\nThe Nebula Genomics hashtag on Twitter is a great place to find out more information about the history of the company and find some articles written about it.\nRead what people are saying about Nebula Genomics on Reddit\nOne Reddit user raises a concern about having their DNA sample analyzed in a laboratory based in Hong Kong, information that is not clearly stated on Nebula\u2019s website.\nAlternatives to Nebula Genomics\nNebula Genomics Review Summary\nNebula Genomics is a great option for anyone who is committed to whole genome sequencing and is looking for genetic information linked to specific research studies. It is not ideal for a customer looking for easy-to-understand information about their genetic risk and personalized lifestyle, diet, or supplement recommendations.\nIf you are interested in commonly analyzed genetic traits, Nebula Genomics has a simple interface for this purpose. However, the price point of whole genome sequencing is an unnecessary cost to learn about these standard traits. Any standard genotyping test can provide this information, and with a process known as imputation, you can infer the variations of many more variations than is sequenced by a SNP chip test.\nFor a more holistic approach to your health, SelfDecode could be a good alternative to Nebula Genomics. By using AI and machine learning, SelfDecode analyzes up to 83 million genetic variants that they know are connected to reliable research in genomics and health sciences. Plus, SelfDecode will provide you with personalized and prioritized recommendations based on your DNA to help you optimize your health.\nIf you want to invest in the potential future benefits of whole genome sequencing, Nebula Genomics can be a good option. However, it\u2019s still debatable how useful this information is currently. If you would like to improve upon your health and quality of life by analyzing your DNA, you will likely get more out of a service like SelfDecode that aims to help you meet those goals.\nRelated\nAbout the Author\nRATE THIS ARTICLE\nFDA Compliance\nThe information on this website has not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration or any other medical body.

Remember not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes before the test:\nOne difference between Nebula Genomics and competitors like 23andMe and Ancestry is that you won\u2019t send in the actual cheek swab. You'll just send the liquid in which your sample was diluted.\nWhat Nebula Genomics Reports Look Like\nOnce Nebula Genomics is done with your DNA analysis, you will receive a genome sequencing report. It will be broken down into five categories:\nTraits Report\nYour traits report covers the following:\nDeep Genetic Ancestry\nIt doesn\u2019t just look at your autosomal DNA, which most competitors do. The company also works with Family Tree DNA to explore your Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\nThis allows Nebula Genomics to give you a more complete ancestry analysis, which includes:\nIt can also connect you to potential relatives from both your maternal and paternal lines.\nOral Microbiome Report\nNebula Genomics can analyze the bacteria present in your mouth. This can help them predict your risk for certain diseases, such as:1\nRemember that an oral microbiome report cannot diagnose the above conditions. Certain microbes may increase your risk of developing these conditions, but other risk factors like lifestyle, diet, and the environment may still contribute.\nPolygenic Scores\nNebula Genomics looks at the combined effects of different genetic variants for which you tested positive. From there, it calculates your genetic risk for particular traits or diseases.\nFor example, your scores can tell you if you\u2019re more likely to suffer from a heart attack or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\u2014among other conditions.\nTake note that you must be careful when interpreting your scores. Polygenic scores may be misinterpreted if you have no knowledge of genetics. It\u2019s best to consult with a geneticist, a genetic counselor, or a medical practitioner for advice on how to decrease your risks from these conditions.\nNebula Library\nThe Nebula Library contains over 200 reports on different genetic variants. New reports are added every week to the ever-growing library.\nHere are some examples of what you might get with this report:\nThe Nebula Research Library keeps you up-to-date with the latest genetic research on your traits. You can use these insights to make healthier choices, such as adjusting your diet and lifestyle to your genetic makeup.\nThis knowledge base can help lower your health risks and improve your overall health.\nGenome Exploration Tools\nApart from analyzing your DNA samples, the company lets you upload raw DNA from Nebula Genomics and other genetic testing companies.\nIt provides tools that allow you to interpret your data. You can access them with a subscription. But you can also upload your DNA for free and get limited reports.5\nGenetic Data Analysis\nThis tool reads your DNA file, calculates your Polygenic Scores, and pulls up reports from the Nebula Library. This analysis will be based on your unique genetic profile.\nAs long as you\u2019re subscribed, you\u2019ll get weekly updates on your traits from the latest findings of genetic researchers. Polygenic Scores help you predict your genetic health predispositions.\nGenome Browser\nYour raw DNA data will include a list of your genetic traits, which look like a combination of letters and numbers. This tool helps you understand what these codes mean.\nFor example, you might be curious about the CYP1A2 gene in your report. You can type it into the Genome Browser to learn more about it.\nThe tool can also help you find genes that increase your genetic predisposition to certain health problems.\nIt\u2019s an interesting feature, but you won\u2019t be able to make much sense of your results on your own. Be sure to take your results to a genetic counselor or geneticist who can read your raw DNA data.\nDNA Data Expansion\nIf you have DNA data from Ancestry and 23andMe, this tool can \u201cfill in\u201d the missing pieces of your report using a statistical process called imputation.\nNebula Genomics says they can expand your DNA file to include more than 35 million genetic markers. You basically get 50 times more information than your original file.5\nHow Much Does Nebula Genomics Cost?\nNebula Genomics can cost you anywhere from $110 to $3,274. It depends on the test, your subscription plan, and whether or not the kit was bought on sale.\nNebula Whole Genome Sequencing Kits\nYou can choose from 2 whole genome tests that test 100% of your DNA:\nBoth kits give you the same results but with different accuracies. Deep DNA 30x whole genome sequencing. It generates up to 100 gigabytes of raw data with \u201chigh\u201d accuracy.\nUltra Deep DNA has a genomic sequencing depth of 100x. It can produce up to 300 gigabytes of downloadable raw DNA with \u201cultra-high\u201d accuracy.\nYou can get either test on sale for $299 or $999.\nNebula Explore Reporting\nIn addition to testing costs, Nebula Genomics will charge you for a report called Explore Reporting. It\u2019s only available on subscription:\nYour subscription includes in-depth ancestry results, unlimited access to tools, and premium support from geneticists. You also get weekly updates based on the latest genetic research.\nYou can\u2019t opt out or cancel your subscription until after they\u2019ve analyzed your DNA. So if this is your first time with the DNA company, you have no other option but to subscribe.\nHow Nebula Genomics Protects Your Privacy\nHere\u2019s how Nebula Genomics keeps your information safe. They:\nNebula Genomics offers Privacy First DNA Testing, which makes it one of the most private DNA tests. It partnered with Oasis Labs, so you can conveniently protect your privacy with an app.6\nWhen you open an account, you can choose how they use your information. They make sure they:\nIf you let Nebula Genomics use your information, they have to compensate you. Regardless of what you choose, you will retain ownership over your genetic information.\nNebula Genomics uses blockchain technology to assure users of their privacy. They also claim to offer anonymous genetic sequencing.\nIs Nebula Genomics Accurate?\nYes. Nebula Genomics offers one of the most accurate DNA test kits on the market. The company's tests provide 10,000 times more data than competing genetic tests.\nThe kit does more than autosomal DNA testing. It also performs Y-DNA and mtDNA testing to give you a more comprehensive report.\nThe company uses a next-generation gene analysis tool that sequences all of your DNA. It can reveal all of your genetic variants and provide incredibly reliable results.\nNebula Genomics checks 6,000,000,000 positions on one\u2019s gene to provide the utmost accuracy.\nNebula Genomics vs. Other At-Home DNA Tests\nCompared to other DNA sequencing companies, Nebula offers something different. It decodes 100% of your DNA. Most competitors only decode a fraction of your DNA (0.02%).7\nWhile 23andMe and AncestryDNA read DNA at 600,000 positions, Nebula Genomics offers next-generation sequencing (NGS) that reads genetic information at 6 billion positions.\nNebula Genomics also offers 30X and 100X whole genome sequencing. This means it can sequence your entire genome 30 to 100 times, including your:\nWhile most competitors only check on your recent ancestry, Nebula Genomics digs deeper. It looks into the family history of your maternal and paternal lines.\nIt can also test for genetic health risks, including genes you may have acquired from your mother or father. It can be beneficial for uncovering rare genetic mutations.\nNebula Genomics stands out because it can sequence DNA at a much faster and larger scale.\nKnow Your DNA Reviews\nLooking for a DNA test that's accurate and can tell you about your health and heritage?\nRelated Pages"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Archives\nCategories\nMeta\nI Tried the Nebula Genomics DNA Test and Here\u2019s What I Found\nI\u2019m no stranger to doing DNA tests: I have done AncestryDNA and had a great experience with it. They are so many options, but I was intrigued when Nebula Genomics reached out with a particular angle for its whole genome sequencing beyond finding long-lost relatives: you can discover more about your genetic make-up and how it might play into everything from food intolerances to gut microbiome.\nWhat is Nebula Genomics?\nStarted by George Church, a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Science and Technology at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Nebula is designed to decode all your DNA. There are three tiered options: Standard, Deep, and Ultra Deep. The most popular option is Deep, which decodes up to 100GB of data based on 30x DNA sequencing depth. This includes decoding all 20,000 genes to identify common genetic mutations, rare genetic mutations, and deliver an oral microbiome report. Go a step further with the Ultra Deep whole genome sequencing that detects predispositions for just about anything, including rare genetic mutations. This makes it ideal for those who are curious if they might be predisposed to a particular genetic mutation that might be common among their family members, for example.\nIt\u2019s not cheap: pricing is US$299 for the Standard (on sale at the time of this writing for US$99) that provides a basic ancestry report and detects common predispositions, US$999 for the Deep (on sale for US$299), and US$3,000 for the Ultra Deep (on sale for US$999).\nThe value is in the additional information beyond familial history. Nebula notes that gut health is trending these days, with people more often experiencing symptoms like bloating, upset stomach, and food intolerances. While people try everything from special shakes and pills to restrictive diets and programs to reduce symptoms or cut out potentially triggering foods, the truth is that a lot of these reactions are decided by genetics. \u201cYour genes decide and regulate how many microbiomes are in your gut,\u00a0which help digest food and produce molecules essential for life,\u201d says Nebula.\nThe company quotes a University of Bristol\u2019s international study, \u201cPioneering research reveals certain human genes relate to gut bacteria,\u201d which states \u201cspecific changes in DNA \u2013 the chains of molecules comprising our genetic make-up \u2013 affected both the existence and amount of particular bacteria in the gut.\u201d The study explains the identification of \u201c13 DNA changes related to changes in the presence or quantity of gut bacteria.\u201d\nPresumably, then, by using the data discovered in a test like this one, you can leave the troublesome diets and gut health programs out of the equation and simply see based on genetics what foods are the likely culprits and which ones aren\u2019t. Armed with that information, you can make positive lifestyle adjustments.\nHow it Works\nLike with other DNA test kits, once you order and receive the kit, the first thing you need to do is register online. An identification number is noted on the test tube as well as on the instructions, which allows you to register with the anonymous data so your name is never attached to the results (though you do need to enter your e-mail address and gender when first registering).\nMake sure not to eat, drink, or smoke for at least 30 minutes prior to taking the sample. Also make sure that you don\u2019t try to gather a sample while sick from any type of bacterial or viral infection in your oral cavity.\nOnce ready, take a sample from your cheek using the included swab. Nebula advises you to do this for a full 60 seconds while rotating the swab around your cheek to ensure it captures enough DNA. Once finished (I used a timer to ensure I did it for long enough), place the tip of the swab into the tube with the solution, snap off the bottom portion, put it into the biohazard bag, place it in the return envelope, and send it back to the company. An envelope with prepaid postage is included for buyers in the U.S., this isn\u2019t the case for other countries, including Canada. I received a blank envelope but the instructions indicate the address for returning the sample (based in Houston, Texas). I provided the stamps and dropped everything off in the mailbox.\nWithin a few weeks, I received my results via e-mail. (Nebula notes that there are some delays in processing due to a backlog caused by COVID-19.)\nThe Results\nThe sheer amount of detail in the results was overwhelming. I could spend weeks analyzing the data, reading the related reports, and Googling terms, from specific types of bacteria to various potential illnesses, going down a full rabbit hole if I so choose.\nThe results are divided into a different categories: traits, relating to appearance and hormones, behaviour and perception, body and athleticism, and nutrition and diet; ancestry; microbiome; and library, which indexes hundreds of reports to advise of your genetic predispositions to everything from PTSD to gallstones, dementia, glaucoma, walking pace, coronary artery disease, thyroid stimulating hormone, Alzheimer\u2019s resilience, and much more.\nThis is a good thing. You get tons of insight, although you may need some help making sense of it all. The results indicate where you fall based on a percentage scale with regards to different results. In some cases, the results are straightforward. For example, my genetic make-up suggests a high likelihood of near-sightedness (which I do indeed have).\nIn others, however, the results can be confusing and even scary. Do I really have that much bacteria? Is that normal? And if I have increased levels of one over another, does it mean I\u2019m more likely to get cancer? There needs to be a bit of work in dumbing down the data to make it more palatable to the average user who doesn\u2019t possess a degree in medicine or science nor have the time to rifle through pages and pages of reports to try to make sense of it.\nNonetheless, I found a lot of the information to be thoroughly interesting. In some cases, it was right on the money, such as with the near-sightedness, the fact that I have a higher likelihood of being left-handed (I am), or even that I am likely to be lactose intolerant (I suspect this to be the case). In other cases, it was off: I love cilantro, though my genetic make-up suggests that I\u2019m more likely to fall into the camp of people who swear it tastes like soap.\nThere is limited data available under traits, highlighting a \u201csmall collection of well-established genetic traits.\u201d But when I entered library, there were 287 reports related to genetic markers found in my DNA. You can scroll through the entire list, type a search term, or use words from the tag cloud to get some ideas of what to look for, like genes related to addiction, diet, metabolism, prostate, skin, kidneys, and more.\nI learned that I have a high genetic predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes but also very high resilience to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I have a below average genetic predisposition to higher fat consumption and a high genetic predisposition to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (a curvature of the spine, which I indeed have).\nWhen it comes to ancestry, however, I found the results to be far less accurate, at least compared to other services that focus on and excel in that aspect of your DNA, like AncestryDNA. Knowing plenty of back details about my heritage from both my parents, my AncestryDNA results are far more likely to be accurate, right down to regions. The Nebula results seemed to be less accurate. While my mother\u2019s side has Portuguese roots, for example, which AncestryDNA successfully determined, Nebula data pegged my heritage as being from Italy, which is not correct. This is likely due to the company not having as large a sample of users from which to go by and determine as accurate results.\nHow Nebula Handles Privacy\nOne of the biggest concerns with DNA tests is privacy and security: swabbing your cheek and providing a company with literally everything that makes you, well, you, is concerning. Are you putting power in the wrong hands?\nAs noted, the testing process is anonymous, so once your sample arrives, it is known only as the eight-digit identification number label on the vial. Nebula gives customers \u201cfull control over your personal genomic data\u201d and the company says it \u201ccontinues to develop solutions for privacy-preserving genomic data analysis. This includes a blockchain-enabled multiparty access control system that doesn\u2019t rely on any single part. This, says Nebula, helps reduce the risk of security breaches by hackers and prevents unauthorized government access. It also, says the company, protects against \u201cdata privacy infringements by genetic testing providers.\u201d\nBottom Line\nOverall, I was pleased with the sheer amount of data, though I yearned to sit down with someone who could explain it in further detail. With that said, I will likely return again and again to read more reports and gain more insight. It\u2019s both an insightful and educational process, and if you have specific concerns about genetic predispositions to certain illnesses, food intolerances, or even habits, seeing how you fall on a percentage scale can help you curb an issue before it becomes one.\nWith that said, if you\u2019re looking for a genetic test for ancestry and familial history, you\u2019re better off going with a company like AncestryDNA or 24andMe. But for more drilled down data about your personal health and wellness, Nebula provides some great information to justify its high price. While some of the data is simply interesting information to share during watercooler chatter with other family members and friends, others can drive you to make positive changes to prevent or avoid everything from a gambling addiction to increased levels of anxiety.\nNote that the test is not clinically validated and that the results are only for educational and research purposes. Do not use the results for diagnostic purposes, and always seek medical advice if you have any questions or concerns. It\u2019s also worth noting that seeing some of the data can cause psychological distress, so if you tend to be triggered easily by such news about a high likelihood of an illness or health issue, you might want to steer clear of using the kit. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. But in other cases, being armed with information can drive you to become the best possible version of yourself.\nFOLLOW SOCIALS\nYou Might Also Enjoy\n\ufffcBell Fibe TV is Now in Atlantic Canada\nBell Fibe TV is now available to residential customers in ...\n\ufffcGoogle\u2019s Latest Pixel Feature Drops are Worth Using\nThe latest Google Pixel feature drops are all worth using ...\nDJI Osmo Pocket 3 Review: A Content Creator\u2019s Dream\nThe DJI Osmo Pocket 3 portable gimbal camera is a ...\ncontact us\nJohn Thomson\n[email\u00a0protected]\nmobile: 416-726-3667\nChristine Persaud\n[email\u00a0protected]\nOur website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Nebula Genomics is changing how at-home DNA testing companies process the 20,000 genes that constitute the human genome.\nBy offering whole genome sequencing at an affordable price, Nebula Genomics offers the highest level of accuracy for genomic information obtained from a simple swab test.\nWe put their BASIC package to the test and check if their entry-level offer was up to par with their competitors and was worth the $99 asked for.\nWhat is the history behind Nebula Genomics?\nNebula Genomics was initially incorporated in 2016 by three Harvard researchers: George Church, Dennis Grishin, and Kamal Obbad. The company has offices in San Francisco and Boston.\nPr George Chuch is a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and is considered a pioneer in \u201cnext-generation\u201d sequencing and whole-genome sequencing.\nFinanced by numerous Venture Capital funds, including Khosla Ventures, Arch Venture Partners, Fenbushi Capital, Mayfield, F-Prime Capital Partners, GreatPoint Ventures, Hemi Ventures, and Mirae Asset, the start-up rapidly became a major player in the at-home DNA test landscape, mainly due to their reasonably priced offer of whole-genome sequencing.\nOn August 11, Nebula Genomics was acquired by ProPhase Labs for $14.6 million, which seems like an excellent deal. ProPhase operated CLIA certified laboratories will process Nebula Genomics\u2019samples, resulting in a faster turnaround and ultimately better prices for the clients.\nBy combining renowned founders, robust science, and the use of high throughout-top-of-the-line sequencers such as the MGI DNBSEQ-T7 DNA, the company changed how personal genome data is processed and handled. In addition, analyzing genetic mutations open the way to a better understanding of the genome.\nWhat are the various tests offered?\nNebula Genomics offers three different types of tests depending on the completeness of the DNA sequencing, sequencing depth, and degree of details of the information provided.\nBASIC\nBasic by Nebula Genomics\nPrice when reviewed: $99.00\nDEEP\nDeep by Nebula Genomics\nPrice when reviewed: $299.00\nULTRADEEP\nUltra Deep by Nebula Genomics\nPrice when reviewed: $999.00\nWhat is the whole DNA test process and waiting time?\nThe DNA collection process is very standard. After ordering the test on the website, it takes a couple of days to receive the DNA test kit, including a sterile test swab, a collection including some stabilizing agents, a prepaid return envelope, and a simple form summarizing the instruction for collecting the DNA sample.\nThe first thing to do is to register the unique kit number on the Nebula Genomics website. It is then time to start the DNA collection process. It could not be easier.\nAfter 45 seconds of cheek swabbing:\nThe site claims that it takes between eight and ten weeks to receive the results, which is long. In our case, it took less than four weeks to get the results available on the website, which is a very reasonable timeline.\nWhile waiting for the results, you can fill up surveys in the hope of helping science and also more selfishly to gain credits that can be used to buy tests at a discount.\nThe surveys are pretty broad and deal with specific topics such as:\nCombining answers to the surveys with the individual genetic data makes it possible to find new genetic correlations.\nWhat can you learn from your genomic data?\nTo paraphrase Forest Gump, Genomic sequencing is just like a box of chocolate. You never know what you will discover. With 6.4 billion base pairs and 20,000 genes, the entire genome is a huge box of chocolate.\nWhole-genome sequencing allows gaining access to a flow of genetic variants that need to be organized. Thanks to the power of bioinformatics.\nThe reports we received from Nebula Genomics cover:\nFor the Basic test we conducted, we only had access to the traits, basic ancestry information, and personalized DNA reports. So it was certainly enough as an appetizer but remained somehow limited.\nWhole-genome sequencing is undoubtedly a better choice to get more information about the genetic variants and provide real value to personal genome sequencing.\nAncestry\nThe ancestry report that comes with the BASIC package is pretty rough as the world is only divided into 25 regions (East Asia, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, North-central Asia, Southern Africa, Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Northern Africa, Central India subcontinent, Southern India subcontinent, Oceania, Bengal, Eastern Mediterranean, Anatolia, Caucasus, Iranian Plateau, Middle East, Southwestern Europe, Northern Italy, Northeast Europe, Scandinavia, Finland, Northern, and Central Europe, Northern British Isle, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Americas).\nFor the Americas, no distinctions are made between North and South America.\nOur test was conducted on my wife, who is Japanese. So you can imagine her deception when the results only stated that she was just from East Asia without any more details.\nGenome sequencing has the potential to provide many more details about ancestry analysis. The Deep and Ultra Deep whole-genome sequencing packages make the most of the partnership of Nebula Genomics with Family Tree DNA to make the most of the most comprehensive family database available.\nThe 30x sequencing depth, meaning that the same region is read an average of 30 times for extra accuracy, offers an analysis of the Y chromosome DNA for exploring the paternal lineage and mitochondrial DNA for the maternal lineage, while the Basic sequencing only allows to scratch the surface with no real added value for those interested in genetic genealogy.\nTraits report\nThe traits reports are much more informative than the ancestry ones.\nThey are divided into four categories are based on well-established genetic traits. Interestingly, the reports are regularly updated.\nOnly four variants were identified, including one for testosterone levels, which is surprising considering the DNA sample was from a woman.\nWe somehow learned that my wife was prone to dry earwax, freckles (which are rare in the Japanese population), and thick hair (which is true.)\nEach trait characteristic can be expanded to learn more about the genes and variants supporting the results. We also appreciated the possibility of accessing the scientific paper on which the result is based.\nBehavior and Perception variants are standards in DNA data analyses but add a bit of fun to what can become a dry report for non-genetic aficionados.\nThe genetic variants will provide information on:\nThe body & Athletism trait report will explore how your body will potentially react. In addition, a lot of genetic information is provided that may help the way you treat your body.\nGenome sequencing will never provide black and white results. Most of the time, you will obtain a probability of developing a condition or the risk of developing a disease.\nThe trait analysis is not different, and carrying a genetic variant for high blood pressure does not mean that you will systematically develop hypertension. Still, it means that genetically you may be more prone to a specific condition.\nArmed with this knowledge, it will then be up to you to treat your health and body in a way that will balance the genetic risks. In that sense, the data provided by Nebula Genomics carry much value, and it may help you treat your health more holistically.\nThe body & Athletism will concentrate on:\nThis trait report was exciting and amusing as it describes the potential taste for sweets or will detect genetically based food allergies or intolerance.\nThe report will provide information on:\nNebula Library\nThe Nebula Library reports are probably what we think genome sequencing brings the most value. For just $99, we had access to a wealth of scientific knowledge.\nWe received 272 personalized reports based on the latest scientific discoveries, detailing the percentile of the population we fail into for various disease risks or behavioral or physical inherited traits.\nNew reports are also added daily based on the latest articles published, which means that your results will always be accurate and up to date.\nIt is easy to spend hours browsing through the data. The results can be sorted by polygenic score, showing the percentile in which we fell. Falling in the 100th percentile is a clear indication that you should pay attention.\nAs we mentioned, genetic testing results are a matter of probabilities, and personal genomic companies are always careful not to provide definitive answers, at least for DNA tests aimed at the public.\nWe learned a lot of exciting elements. For example, my wife has a 100% percentile genetic predisposition for being thin, having a high level of vitamin D, suffering from insomnia, being ambidextrous, and suffering from high blood pressure and high level of HDL cholesterol.\nThe interface provides an easy way to sort the results using tags that will group the results in categories such as addiction, aging, alcoholism, allergy, appearance, autoimmunity, behavior, bladder, blood, bone, brain, breast, cancer, dementia, development, diet, eyes, gallbladder, heart, hormones, infection, inflammation, intelligence, intestines, joints, kidneys, liver, lung, metabolism, mind, mouth, muscles, nose, obesity, pancreas, pelvis, pregnancy, prostate, senses, sex, skin, sleep, spine, stomach, taste, thyroid, uterus, vasculature.\nFor the heart only, 23 reports were generated covering numerous elements from Atrial Fibrillation to cholesterol levels, cardiomyopathy, and PR interval. If you are interested in a specific topic, Nebula genomics provides an unprecedented way to analyze your data and know more about your genetic predisposition.\nTrait, SNP, or gene can even search the results of the DNA sequencing.\nEach characteristic can be expanded to know more about it and check your personal data and variants.\nAs an example, we downloaded the report on the genetic predisposition of my wife for high cholesterol. She doesn\u2019t have high cholesterol, but her genetic makeup predisposes her to it.\nThe whole list of variants is presented, with your genotype, effect size, variant frequency, and overall significance. The variants contributing positively to the effect are highlighted in green, while those negatively correlated are highlighted in blue. I can see myself spending hours digging into the genome sequencing data. On top of that, new variants and added as science progresses. DNA sequencing is just the first step-no need to be a geneticist to enjoy the presented reports and are easily understandable.\nThe Gene Analysis and Gene Browser are only available for the DEEP and ULTRADEEP analyses. We certainly regret not being able to have access to them.\nData sharing\nGenomic data sharing is the main point of concern for privacy and healthcare cyberattacks. One of the strong points of Nebula Genomics is its concern with the privacy of the DNA data and the use of blockchain technology to protect your DNA test results.\nWhole-genome sequencing produces a vast amount of data \u2013 up to 300 Gb for the Ultra-Deep analysis- that can be shared with your doctor or even with another company that can potentially detect mutations not included in the Nebula Genomics database.\nHence the DNA testing raw data can be downloaded in various raw formats compatible with your intended use: BAM, BAI, FASTQ, and VCF. Note that the larger dataset is only stored for 14 days. The DNA data is still available afterward, but it will require a maximum time of 48 hours to be prepared.\nIs the Nebula Genomics test worth it?\nIn this Nebula Genomic review, we hope to have convinced you that we enjoyed this genetic test. We tested the entry-level version, and even for just $99, we appreciated what we learned from this DNA testing kit.\nWhole-genome sequencing offers a whole new level of accuracy that was unachievable just a couple of years ago. In addition, the DNA collection and processing time was efficient and straightforward.\nEven though this entry-level test is certainly not recommended for those interested in tracking their ancestors and potentially make new family connections, the healthcare part of the results was well presented, relatively complete, and informative.\nFor those starting the genetic exploration journey, Nebula Genomics has a lot to offer. However, we somehow recommend a more comprehensive test to make the most of the power of next-generation sequencers and do not feel frustrated with just creaming the surface of what your DNA has to offer.\nWas this article helpful?\nAt-home DNA Test Kits: What can you learn from them?\nHow long does it take to get a DNA test back?\nBest Digital Health Black Friday Deals\nTable of Contents\nCan AI change Home Health for Good?\nWhat Is The Cost Of Neurofeedback Therapy?\nDoes Medicare cover neurofeedback therapy?\nWhat future for Wearable blood pressure monitors?\nElectronic Tattoos are getting traction in Healthcare\nBest smartwatch to monitor blood pressure for 2024\nBest ECG smartwatches for 2024 (FDA approved/cleared)\nCan the apple watch check the body temperature?"
