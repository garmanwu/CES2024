        "raw_content": "We checked out The World\u2019s First \u201cAroma Speaker\u201d at CES 2024\nIt projects audio as well as over 100 different unique scents. The creators, Aroma Join, say that developers can customize their own scents and use an SDK (scent development kit?) to create specific experiences that combine video with smell to make a much more immersive overall experience.\nAs I entered Showstoppers, I walked past the exhibitors, even past the food buffet (which didn\u2019t have a smell, to be frank), but was stopped dead in my tracks when I smelled a distinct salted caramel scent coming from somewhere. I looked around and saw a sign that said \u201cDigital Scent Technology\u201d two meters away from me. At the booth sat two rather gorgeous glossy-red speakers, and a screen that displayed a looped video of different sceneries. The folks at Aroma Join were debuting their \u201cAroma Speaker 60\u201d for the first time \u2013 a speaker capable of projecting both sound and scent up to distances of 6.5 feet.\nDesigner: AromaJoin\nThe metaverse, or at least its initial stages, has always focused on just three things \u2013 sight, sound, and touch. If you\u2019re wondering why metaverse experiences (or spatial ones, for Apple lovers) aren\u2019t highly immersive, it\u2019s because your brain uses a combination of inputs from all your senses together. Leave out one or more, and the experience feels less believable\u2026 Designer Jinsop Lee has a very interesting TED Talk on this too. What the Aroma Speaker 60 does is plug that gap in a way. By shooting both audio as well as aromas, it subconsciously tricks your brain into believing what it sees. You\u2019ll see a grassy field and feel more relaxed, even if you don\u2019t know it. Or if you see food, your mind will make your tongue salivate.\nScent-firing devices have been around for a decade now, but if you listen to anyone who\u2019s tried them, they\u2019ll all tell you the same thing. The technology isn\u2019t completely there yet. I stood alongside industry veteran Vincent Nguyen and his first reaction was \u201cthis isn\u2019t like the stuff we\u2019ve seen before\u201d. The Aroma Speaker does a few things incredibly well. It hyper-targets an area and shoots scents really far (up to 6-7 feet). That\u2019s enough to catch your attention even if you aren\u2019t paying attention. The smells are distinct, powerful, and VERY dynamic\u2026 by which I mean when a scene on the TV or monitor chances, the old scent vanishes and a new scent appears almost instantly.\nAlthough the technology is a bit of a black box (they won\u2019t tell us how it works), it boils down to a set of aroma modules that sit in each individual speaker unit, totaling 10 modules in two speakers. Each module is equipped with 6 cartridges that have essential oils of some sort. The speaker (and the software on the laptop) use those 6 cartridges as the building blocks for scents, creating as many as 60 different distinct scents. Sure, the speakers fire audio too, but it\u2019s the fragrances that really set it apart.\nThe folks at AromaJoin have figured out how to precisely blend these 6 base fragrances to create an entire gamut of aromas \u2013 both pleasant and unpleasant. The scented caramel aroma was almost too strong, but the floral aromas were wonderful, the speaker even generated a petrichor aroma as the laptop display showed an endless green field. The scene then switched to a polluted city and you could instantly smell the smoke. The fragrances weren\u2019t a 100% exact (your mind can somewhat tell that they\u2019re artificial), but they fell well within their ballpark.\nAromaJoin isn\u2019t currently selling these speakers but is using them as a proof of concept to lure developers and marketers into building out the ecosystem. They\u2019ve got an open-source app and SDK that allows people to build scent profiles for their video content, and with time, hopefully, AromaJoin will have an entire library that then makes the Aroma Speaker 60 a much more lucrative buy. Until that happens, the company IS selling its VR accessory, the Aroma Shooter Wearable 3, a neck-worn device that works in tandem with headsets like the Meta Quest 3 to help make the metaverse more immersive and multisensory.\nRelated Posts\nThinking of buying the Galaxy S24?

        "raw_content": "Aromajoin\u00a0unveils at CES 2024 first speakers that can deliver more than 100 scents\nJapanese company Aromajoin unveiled the Aroma Speaker 60 speakers at the CES 2024 exhibition, which reproduce not only sound but also over a hundred different unique scents. The manufacturer even offered a software development kit (SDK) to help content creators combine video with scent for an immersive experience.\nCurrent metaverse technologies, or spatial computing as Apple prefers to call it, operate with a maximum of three senses: sight, hearing, and touch. However, this is insufficient for complete immersion because the brain processes input from all senses, and skipping one or more diminishes the realism. The Aroma Speaker 60 speakers attempt to fill one of these gaps by reproducing both sound and scents, convincing the human brain of what it sees.\nAlthough scent synthesizers have existed for over a decade, they have not produced such a deep impression, as reported by the Yanko Design resource. The Aroma Speaker 60 targets a specific area of space, dispersing scents up to a distance of about 2 meters, enough to capture attention. The scents are distinct, powerful, and even dynamic: when a scene changes on the screen, one aroma disappears, and almost instantly another takes its place.\nThe manufacturer has not disclosed the technical mechanisms of the scent synthesizer, but it involves a set of aromatic modules located in each speaker\u201410 modules in total across two columns. Each module includes 6 cartridges with essential oils of basic scents, from which all other scents are formed. The system, controlled by software on a laptop, combines substances in these cartridges to create ready-made scents\u2014both pleasant and unpleasant.\nFor example, the scent of salted caramel was almost excessively strong, but floral aromas seemed quite fitting. When an endless green field appeared on the screen, the aroma of petrichor, which usually occurs after rain, emerged; then, when the laptop displayed an urban environment, testers sensed the smell of smoke. While these scents have not become entirely lifelike\u2014 the brain still hinted that they were artificial\u2014they matched their level quite well.\nAromajoin has not yet released the Aroma Speaker 60 for sale. The company showcased it at the exhibition to demonstrate the functionality of its technology and attract developers to build an ecosystem. The company already has an open-source application and SDK through which users can create scent profiles for videos. Currently, the Aroma Shooter Wearable 3 device is available for purchase\u2014it is worn around the neck and works in conjunction with virtual reality headsets, including Meta Quest 3, to make the immersion effect in the metaverse more realistic.\nmonth\nweek\nday\nTerms of use\nAdvertise with us\nMobile: +374 96 031566\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]\nAbout Project\nNewsletter"
