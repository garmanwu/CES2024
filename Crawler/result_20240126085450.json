        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities. With an IP55 rating for moisture and dust resistance, they promise up to six hours of battery life.\nUnique to these earbuds is the integration of Polar\u2019s Flow data analytics, which includes a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor for efficient workout planning.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Three Digital Health Trends to Watch at CES 2024\nCES 2024 is less than four months away, and in advance of the world\u2019s largest and most influential consumer technology showcase, Future Healthcare Today is exploring some of the top trends and stories that are shaping the consumer electronics industry.\nOf all consumer technology sectors and markets, few have as explosive potential for growth as the digital health solution marketplace. These technologies saw a massive increase in adoption from the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised important questions about access to healthcare, and made people around the globe more invested in their own health and wellness. However, despite the rapid adoption over the past half of a decade, the digital health solution market segment is still relatively nascent, with considerable room and opportunity to grow.\nThese emerging digital health solutions have the ability to give consumers control of their own health and wellness. This is a massive change for many consumers that are accustomed to a healthcare industry that mainly functions to treat illness when it happens and restricts access to care to those with health insurance, referrals, or geographic proximity to providers.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES\u2026\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that research from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) found that 70 percent of consumers say they will likely use one or more digital health solutions in the future to improve their overall health or well-being. It\u2019s also not shocking that the use of telehealth among providers skyrocketed from 14 percent in 2016, to more than 80 percent in 2022, according to Healthcare IT News.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES, the world\u2019s preeminent consumer electronic showcase hosted annually by the CTA.\nThis year\u2019s event \u2013 which will take place in early January in Las Vegas \u2013 is the perfect venue to see some of the innovative digital health solutions entering the marketplace, and an incredible opportunity for solution providers to demonstrate exciting new digital healthcare capabilities. This is why healthcare technology companies such as Nuheara, CareWear Corp, Wearable Therapeutics, and Essence SmartCare attend CES.\nBut what overarching digital health trends will be on display at this year\u2019s show? And what are consumers looking for when analyzing and weighing investments in new digital health products and solutions? The CTA recently released a study entitled, Driving Consumer Adoption of Digital Health Solutions, that could enlighten health tech companies. Here are three factors that will impact digital health solutions at this year\u2019s CES:\nTaking control and becoming proactive\nAs we discussed, healthcare in much of the world for much of the past few decades has revolved around treating illness when consumers have symptoms of disease. Rarely have consumers had access to their own vitals and detailed information about their own health and wellness \u2013 often having to wait until they don\u2019t feel well and get sent by a doctor for a litany of expensive tests.\nThe COVID pandemic and emerging digital healthcare technologies have put a stop to that. People around the world are actively looking to take control of their health and become more proactive in their own wellness \u2013 trying to actively stave off disease and chronic illness with changes in behavior or routine.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data\nThis has led to increased demand for Fitbits, smartwatches, and other wearable solutions that consumers can regularly use to monitor their overall health. According to the CTA\u2019s research, 73 percent of consumers report that these solutions help them feel more in control of their health, and encourage them to take better care of themselves. Additionally, 71 percent claimed that these solutions have raised their quality of life.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data. Anticipate that the solutions being exhibited at this year\u2019s CES will deliver on many of these consumer requirements.\nIncreasing access for all\nAccording to CTA research, 59 percent of people have utilized telehealth appointments even with the pandemic in the rearview mirror. And there is a very good reason why telehealth offerings are so popular.\nWithin the U.S., in particular, there is limited access to healthcare among underserved populations. About 112 million people \u2013 approximately 40 percent of American adults \u2013 struggle to pay for healthcare. And, due to shortages in specialists and other healthcare professionals, and most healthcare providers concentrated around metropolitan areas, approximately live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital. 18 percent of Americans live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital.\nIt is imperative that underserved Americans can receive the healthcare they need.\nDigital health solutions \u2013 such as telehealth services \u2013 can help to overcome this challenge by offering a way to get health care without the need to go to an office or hospital building. This means more Americans can access quality healthcare and specialist care \u2013 including mental health services and addiction services \u2013 without ever leaving their homes.\nThis change in how we access healthcare services was the focus of a session during CES 2023 entitled, The Future of Care in America: A New Hybrid Model. In this session, visionaries from across the healthcare and healthcare technology industries explored ways in which technology is enabling a new model for patient care. You can watch that session in full in the video below:\nConsidering the historic challenges that Americans have faced in receiving and accessing care, it\u2019s no surprise that telehealth services and other digital health services remain in demand \u2013 and why they\u2019ll be featured prominently at the upcoming CES 2024.\nBringing it all together\nAnyone who has experienced the American healthcare system in the previous few decades understands how disjointed and disconnected it can be. A primary care doctor may refer a patient to a specialist, only to find that the results of previously conducted tests aren\u2019t available to them \u2013 requiring new tests to be run at the patient\u2019s expense. Or, a patient may find themselves answering the same questions repeatedly each and every time they see a different doctor or specialist.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities.\nThis lack of connectivity and interoperability has made healthcare incredibly expensive and less effective. And for digital health solutions and services to truly reach their potential, information needs to be securely shared, and every system and source of healthcare data needs to interoperate.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities. Doctors will be able to securely and remotely access and review the vital signs of a patient from the wearable that\u2019s monitoring them. AI will be able to analyze all available healthcare data and patient histories to identify illnesses and effective treatments in seconds rather than days or weeks.\nBut these capabilities are only possible if everything is integrated and interoperated. And this is why integration and interoperability will be two incredibly in-demand capabilities for digital health devices and services at CES 2024.\nCES is the home for digital health innovation that draws the most innovative companies that are breaking new ground in modern healthcare. Find out what\u2019s new as this field evolves, and what\u2019s next at CES 2024.\nRELATED\nPOSTS\nUnderfunded Hospitals Result in Reduced Access to Emergency Care\nHow AI is Revolutionizing Healthcare from Patient Experience to Operations and Cost Management\nAdvancing Healthcare IT: A Closer Look at Government Initiatives from the ONC, HHS, and VA\nTRENDING NOW\nThree Digital Health Trends to Watch at CES 2024\nDefense in Depth Strategy Protects Healthcare Organizations from Cyber Attacks\nUnlocking the Potential of Mentorship in Healthcare\nHealth-Seekers Level Up Self-Care with Gamification Apps\nAppalachian Regional Healthcare Transforms Machine Learning Insights into Improved Patient Experience\nCONNECT WITH US\nBECOME AN INSIDER\nI consent to having Future Healthcare Today collect my email and I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\nStrategic Communications Group is a digital media company that helps business-to-business marketers drive customer demand through content marketing, content syndication, and lead identification.\nRelated Communities\nFinancial Technology Today\nGovernment Technology Insider\nModern Marketing Today\nRetail Technology Insider\nToday\u2019s Modern Educator\nQuick Links\nBecome a Sponsor\nFuture Healthcare Today offers content and advertising sponsorships to leading healthcare solution and service providers.

        "raw_content": "Secondary Menu\n7 Innovative Devices from CES 2024 Could Reshape Patient Self-Care\nBreadcrumb\nSeparating the breakthrough technologies from those that may not have staying power can be difficult at tech conferences, but the recent CES 2024 show (formerly the Consumer Electronics Show) produced a number of health care-related, attention-getting devices. Some are not commercially available yet, but these products have the potential to help patients take greater control of their health.\n1. Off-the-Cuff Blood Pressure\nGetting patients, particularly those with chronic conditions, to monitor their blood pressure and other vital signs regularly and accurately can be a challenge. Two new cuffless devices aim to make it easier for consumers to take their readings. The Accurate 24 BPM from Accurate Meditech is an FDA-approved, calibration-free blood pressure monitor that can be worn with a lanyard or with a wrist holder. The portable, wearable device measures blood pressure, blood oxygen and core body temperature.\n2. Food Allergen Emergency Control\nAlerje\u2019s Omniject epinephrine auto-injector case attaches to the back of smartphones to give users convenient temperature-appropriate storage for safe use in an emergency. Automatic alerts can be sent from the device to the patient\u2019s allergist, first responders and support circle if a dose from the case is activated.\n3. Portable Hemodialysis\nThe xKidney home and portable hemodialysis unit from Exorenal uses active piston-balancing pumping technology to eliminate daily disinfection required in conventional hemodialysis units. The system\u2019s entire dialysate compartment is disposable and the unit is lightweight.\n4. Noninvasive, Drug-Free Tremor Treatment\nThe GyroGlove from GyroGear is designed to counteract tremors in real time using advanced gyroscopic technology without drugs. The noninvasive device is worn on the wrist and tackles the underlying issue of essential tremor. It features a sturdy magnetic connector, wipe-clean surface and oversized attachment point, and the battery pack is designed for easy charging.\n5. Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring Wearables\nHealthcare Vision is developing a series of noninvasive glucose monitoring devices that use Raman spectroscopy and algorithms to provide a wearable option for those with diabetes or prediabetes. The company says the technology provides precise glucose readings within seconds and comes in wristband, ring and other models. The devices are designed to eliminate the need for finger sticks and related products.\n6. Wearable Infusion Pumps\nInfuzamed has introduced a wearable infusion pump with advanced remote monitoring and control capabilities. It features a large-volume pump for precise intravenous medication, sits on a patient\u2019s forearm and requires no additional attachments. Infuzamed\u2019s Wi-Fi-based monitoring program tracks patients in real time, collecting and transmitting vital signs remotely to medical personnel.\n7. Testing for UTIs at home\nThe health tech firm Vivoo has launched an at-home urinary tract infection diagnostic kit. Users will be able to download the company\u2019s app, urinate on a test strip and scan the strip with a smartphone. Vivoo\u2019s deep-learning image processing helps to determine the results, which can be forwarded to a physician to arrange for a prescription to treat the infection. The test strips are going through FDA review, but the company anticipates that the product will be available later this year through online retailers.\nRelated Resources\nRelatedNews Articles\nRelatedData & Insights\nRelatedEvents & Education\nAHA Footer\nNoncommercial use of original content on www.aha.org is granted to AHA Institutional Members, their employees and State, Regional and Metro Hospital Associations unless otherwise indicated.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024 Preview: Innovations In Wearables And Health\nCES logo\nCES 2024 takes place from January 9 to January 12 in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a giant technology show where innovations across consumer and health tech are shown off.\nMore than 115,000 people came to the show in 2023, and 2024 is set to be even larger according to the official stats.\nThere will be plenty of surprises at the show, but some of the health tech and wearable-related tech there is already known. And there are clues as to some bits that have not been officially announced. Here are some of the most notable examples.\nWithings: Eye catching innovation?\nYou can hope for something intriguing from Withings, even if it will not appear on sale all that soon. At CES 2023, Withings showed the U-Scan, a headline-grabber of an announcement. The U-Scan is a urine analysis sensor designed to be mounted inside your toilet bowl. It can measure ketones, Vitamin C levels, water composition and acid base. One year on it\u2019s still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the Withings website. It has teased something equally compelling may be at CES 2024, tweeting \u201cthe dawn of our next revolution is imminent\u201d on December 22.\nFitbit: Luxe 2?\nWhile there is no major suggestion Fitbit has bit launch plans for CES 2024, there are some signs a Fitbit Luxe 2 is on the way. A wearable that, assuming there are no brand new lines in the works, must be either the Luxe 2 or an Ace 4, has passed through the FCC. Such a watch is likely to appear at some point in Q4 2024. However, will it come to CES? That is much less clear. The Fitbit Luxe arrived in 2021. And Fitbit has not seen many launches since Google\u2019s acquisition of the brand in January 2021.\nSo When Is The\nRebel Moon\nR Rated Snyder Cut s Release Date Then\nMassive California Waves Hospitalize At Least Eight And Cause Evacuations Along Pacific Coast\nThree Supermoons, Two Comets And The \u2018Great American Eclipse:\u2019 The Sky In 2024\nSamsung: Fit 3 incoming\nThe Samsung Fit 3 leaked in November and is expected to launch in January. It's more likely to be seen as part of confidential meetings at CES than a major public announcement, though, as Samsung will hold one of its big Unpacked events on January 18. That\u2019s just a few days after CES closes up shop. The watch\u2019s predecessor, the Galaxy Fit 2, arrived way back in 2020. This one has a much larger OLED screen, which should make it feel more like a smartwatch.\nRuah: Easier sleep apnea diagnosis\nRuahlab Inc.\u2019s Ruah wearable has received an innovation award from the CES CEA organisation even before the show begins. From a glance it looks a bit like a face mask worn only over the nose. However, it\u2019s an AI-powered device that monitors breathing patterns, in order to help diagnose sleep apnea. As such, it\u2019s a much more convenient alternative to polysomnography, which uses a multi-sensor polysomnogram to assess sleep abnormalities.\nAbbott: Glucose monitoring\nAccording to Wareable, Abbott plans to show its consumer-focused Lingo continuous glucose monitor tech at CES 2024. This means we could be getting closer to an expansion into the US. Lingo is already available in the UK, where it costs \u00a3150 (around $190) a month and is sold as \"the future of metabolism ownership.\u201d Lingo involves wearing a biosensor to monitor for glucose spikes.\nInception Lab: Bedsore diagnosis\nInception Lab is another winner of a CES innovation award. Its work is in the healthcare industry, but is a technology anyone can understand. It has made a bedsore sensor called Inception One. They are placed in \u201careas suspected of bedsores\u201d in order to help diagnose the problem without relying simply on a visual inspection.\nYou can expect news at CES to start pumping out from January 7, one of two \u201cMedia Days\u201d ahead of the show\u2019s opening."

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.
