View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231214334946/en/\nDeRUCCI Wins Two CES 2024 Innovation Awards\nA pioneer in the sleep industry, DeRUCCI has pushed the boundaries of innovation to create products that enhance sleep quality and good health. DeRUCCI will be a hub of activity during CES 2024, showcasing the following AI innovations:\nSmart Mattresses: the DeRUCCI T11 Pro and MWI1 Smart Mattresses are Artificial Intelligence smart sleep IoT solutions based on extensive sleep/health research with international universities and institutions. The DeRUCCI smart mattresses are the first to actually warn users about potential health issues before they are aware of them, monitoring and instantly adjusting to the individual\u2019s health for optimal sleep. The mattresses combine DeRUCCI\u2019s patented AI technologies and software algorithms with sophisticated styling, employing AI sleep/health sensors that automatically track body shape and changes in sleeping position, body temperature, heart rate, and health with air support units that instantly respond to each person. The mattresses also connect to DeRUCCI and other IoT home appliances to control the bedroom\u2019s smart thermostat, air conditioner, aromatherapy, air purifier, sleep-enhancing lighting, meditation products, sleep aids, and other IoT devices.\nAnti-Snore Pillow: the DeRUCCI Anti-Snore Pillow is the first all-in-one smart pillow that integrates monitoring, screening, and intervention to alleviate snoring and reduce the risk of sleep apnea, which can often be a precursor to serious disease. The Anti-Snore Smart Pillow is an intelligent pillow and app solution that alleviates snoring by adjusting the position of the head for the highest effectiveness on the market, reducing snoring by up to 89% (data from an internal clinical trial).\nIntelligent Height Adjustable Pillow: The height can be adjusted according to different individuals\u2019 neck curves. Designed for neck support and better sleep, the Intelligent Height Adjustable Pillow monitors sleeping positions and dynamically adjusts the pillow height throughout the entire sleep cycle relieving neck fatigue and ensuring that the user wakes up feeling refreshed. The smart pillow also offers comprehensive sleep support with various sleep assistance modes to help users fall asleep more easily with detailed sleep reports to gain deep insights into sleep habits to optimize sleep quality.\nDeRUCCI AI Tidal Algorithm: A first of its kind, the DeRUCCI patented Tidal algorithm simultaneously adapts and customizes to each user\u2019s various individual sleeping positions and makes real-time adjustments to perfectly match height, shape, and body areas, such as shoulders, back, waist, hips, and legs. DeRUCCI leverages its research in ergonomics, AI, and big data, and analyzes factors, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), sleeping positions, pressure distribution, height, and firmness.\nAir Support Units: Piezoelectric ceramic sensors control rubber-sensing airbags and support materials, such as springs, foam, and latex. The airbag\u2019s height and firmness are also adjusted for position and smoothness.\nAI Sleep Monitoring: analyzes changes in users\u2019 physiological parameters monitoring sleep with reports on sleep quality, making it easier to reach deep sleep. Provides personalized sleep consultations and recommendations with sleep medicine and wellness companies to optimize sleep, exercise, and diet, essential for elderly care and specialized sports.\nAI Sleep Health Warnings: analyzes users\u2019 disease data, along with geographic location, age, and sleep monitoring metrics to provide early chronic disease warnings.\nDeRUCCI IoT Products: Other DeRUCCI IoT home products in the new line-up include the Intelligent Switch, Intelligent Voice Control Panel, Intelligent Gateway, and Curtain Track, among others.\nThe DeRUCCI AIoT line of sleep health products will be available in the U.S. in 2024. DeRUCCI\u2019s mission is to provide innovative sleep solutions that contribute to a healthier, well-rested world.

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate. If a company has less than 10 years of experience, it loses points in this category.\nAshburn, VA Window Replacement FAQs\nHow much does a window install cost?\nThe average cost of installing a single window can range between $450 and $650. There are a variety of factors that affect how much it costs, including your property's location, the materials used in designing the windows, how energy-efficient the windows are, local labor costs, styles and sizes of windows and the number of windows.\nWhat are the types of windows?\nThere are several different kinds of windows you can get for your home, including slider windows, double-hung and single-hung windows, picture windows, casement windows, awning windows, bay windows and transom windows.\nDo you really need to use a window installation company?\nYou should hire a window installation company whenever you need to replace your windows. Installing windows is a involved process that can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's best left to the professionals.\nHow do you know it's time to replace your windows?\nWindows typically have a lifespan of around 20 to 30 years, but anytime you notice damage on your windows, it's a good time to have an expert take a look at them to see if they need any repairs or replacements.\nShould I replace my windows all at once?\nIf your windows are more than 20 years old, it's probably time to replace all of them. By that point, they are usually less efficient, leakier and/or more damaged than new windows. Replacing your windows all at the same time will involve less paperwork and less time.\nOther Services in Ashburn\nMore window replacement & installers Near Me"
