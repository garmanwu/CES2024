        "raw_content": "Verge TS Ultra Boasts 6 Cameras, Radar, And AI Power\nIt\u2019s Verge\u2019s most technologically advanced model to date.\nMotorcycles of today are taking big steps when it comes to technology, both in terms of performance and safety. At CES 2024, lots of new innovations in the electric mobility space have been unveiled. One of them comes to us from Verge Motorcycles, with the newest iteration of its TS electric motorcycle, the Ultra.\nWe\u2019ve talked about Verge several times in the past, and the company has never been one to shy away from innovation. From its powerful motor to its unique hubless rear wheel configuration, it stands to argue that the Verge TS is one of the most futuristic two-wheelers in production. Now, it gets even better, as the TS Ultra takes safety and security up a notch. According to Verge Motorcycles, the new TS Ultra is the very first motorcycle \u201cequipped with the sense of sight.\u201d\nWhat this means is that the motorcycle is equipped with not one, not two, but a whopping six cameras. On top of that, Verge throws in high-resolution radars and an AI-powered system to manage all the data from the six cameras and the radar. Naturally, with a system as advanced as this, you could pretty much get a bike that rides itself. However, it\u2019s more than likely that we\u2019ll be seeing advanced safety features like adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, and lane departure assistance.\nAll of these safety features, as well as all pertinent ride info can easily be viewed via an intuitive display called \u201cStarmatter Dash.\u201d Marko Lehtim\u00e4ki, the CEO of Verge Motorcycles, explained how the technology found in the new TS Ultra was developed to give riders the best riding experience possible. \u201cVerge is developing the world\u2019s most advanced electric superbikes that focus on the riding experience. We do not want to compromise on that. Starmatter Dash provides a visual and intuitive interface, which gives the rider a clear real-time view of the bike\u2019s features and status at a glance.\u201d\nOn the performance side of the equation, the Verge TS was never a slouch. It\u2019s powered by a unique integrated hub motor that delivers power directly to the wheel. Thanks to its hubless design, it\u2019s capable of producing quite a lot of torque. Verge says that the 102-kilowatt (137 horsepower) motor pumps out a whopping 737.5 pound-feet of torque at the rear wheel. This enables the electric two-wheeler to hit a top speed of 124 miles per hour, and rocket from a standstill to 60 miles an hour in just 3.5 seconds.\nThe Verge TS Ultra is currently on display at CES 2024 in Las Vegas Nevada. So, if you happen to be in the area, or are actually visiting the show to get a glimpse of the latest tech, you can go and see the new Verge TS Ultra in the metal.\nIn Case You Missed It:\nSource: Verge Motorcycles\nTrending\nFind a vehicle\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article"

Learn more\nThe Verge TS Ultra Is an Electric Hyperbike With 855FT-LBs Of Torque\nBy: Tim Huber Published: Jan 05, 2023\nBy: Tim Huber Published: Jan 05, 2023\nFirst breaking cover in 2018 as the RMK E2 before later being rebranded to its current name, the Verge TS is an ultra-unique fully-electric streetfighter-meets-hypercruiser model with a futuristic-looking hubless rear wheel design. And while the TS already boasted some impressive specs \u2014 a\u00a0 sub-4-second 0-60mph time, 186-mile range, and a claimed 737.5ft-lbs of torque \u2014 the Finnish firm has now developed an even high-performance ebike variant with the new and improved, range-topping Verge TS Ultra.\nPropelling the Verge TS Ultra is a cutting-edge 150-kW (201-hp) powertrain that generates an astonishing (claimed) 855ft-lbs of torque and offers a top speed of 125mph. Not only does the Ultra version offer more power, but it also does so while affording more autonomy, with the Ultra-spec\u2019s battery now being good for an impressive 233-miles of (urban) range on a single charge and having the ability to be fully juiced up in just 25 minutes when using Fast Charging.\nVisually, the Ultra version of the TS has also received a few upgrades. The regular model\u2019s stacked projector headlight setup has been flanked by a set of downforce-generating aerodynamic winglets on either side, and the regular TS\u2019 seemingly-two-up-capable seat has also been replaced with a sportier superbike-style monoposto item with sleek bum-stop-equipped cowl and what we presume is better aero. What\u2019s more, the top-of-the-line Ultra-spec also sees the TS\u2019 standard five gloss color options (red, lime green, black, yellow, white) now being supplemented by matte versions of those same hues.\nAvailable for preorder requiring only a \u20ac1,000 (~ $1,054) deposit, the 2024 Verge TS Ultra starts at \u20ac62,132 (~ $65,455) and is scheduled to begin deliveries in Q4 of 2023. The EV outfit\u2019s website also features an online configurator that allows users to build out and then preorder their own custom-configured Verge TS Ultra \u2014 along with the lower-specced Verge TS and Verge TS Pro which start at \u20ac37,624 (~ $39,580) and \u20ac41,709 (~ $43,875) respectively.\nFrom Our Partners\nRelwen\u2019s Quilted Tanker Jacket Is the Ultimate Wintertime Coat for Layering\nPresented by Huckberry\nNike\u2019s Zoom Vomero 5 Is One of the Most Complex Running Shoes Around\nPresented by Nike\nThe Best USA-Made Everyday Carry Essentials [VIDEO]\nPresented by Gerber\nMore Motorcycles\nBRABUS Just Made Its Most Powerful Boat Ever with the Shadow 1200 Black Ops Signature Edition\nBy Ethan Brehm\nThis Rare 1969 Shelby GT350 B Production Fastback Race Car Is Up For Grabs\nBy Tim Huber\nFord Unveils Bronze Package for All-Electric 2024 Mustang Mach-E GT\nBy Ethan Brehm\nWinnebago Adds the Mercedes Sprinter to Its Ekko Camper Van Lineup\nBy Ethan Brehm\nJeep Offers a Glimpse at 2025 All-Electric 600-HP Wagoneer S SUV\nBy Tim Huber\nFord Hints At a Forthcoming F-150 Lightning Raptor With Its Switchgear Concept\nBy Tim Huber\nIndependently published in Los Angeles, CA\n\u00a92024 HICONSUMPTION LLC.

        "raw_content": "Motorcycles of CES 2024: AI-driven tech steals the spotlight\nEvery January, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) attracts tech giants, automakers, electronics brands, and startups to Las Vegas. With more than 40 categories represented, this year's event showcased all corners of technology, from Hyundai\u2019s electric air taxi to voice-controlled bidets.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stood center stage this year, with Volkswagen announcing a ChatGPT-supported digital assistant and Samsung unveiling an AI-driven robot. Electric motorcycle manufacturers were no exception, and innovations revealed by two brands \u2014 Verge and Horwin \u2014 stole much of the spotlight.\nVerge TS Ultra and Starmatter software\nVerge introduced the TS Ultra model at CES 2023. According to the Finland-based company, its flagship electric produces 201 horsepower, generates 885 foot-pounds of torque, and reaches a top speed of 124 mph. The Ultra\u2019s 20.2 kWh battery reportedly nets 233 miles (on a single charge) and charges from zero to 80% in just 25 minutes. If those claims sound optimistic, they\u2019re only matched by Verge\u2019s Starmatter software.\nAt CES 2024, Verge debuted an updated TS Ultra, monitored by its Starmatter intelligence platform. Utilizing six cameras (three rear-facing and three front-facing) and radar units fore and aft, the Starmatter Vision system expands the rider's \u201cspatial awareness\u201d with a \u201c360-degree view\u201d of the motorcycle's surroundings. The system then relays potential hazard alerts to the user via the new Starmatter TFT display.\nThe safety-oriented sensors aren\u2019t the only hardware keeping tabs on the TS Ultra\u2019s every move. A GPS module and an accelerometer also record vehicle data, while cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth compatibility keep the model connected. By processing and analyzing the collected data, Verge\u2019s AI can \u201cbuild powerful machine learning models\u201d that adapt the TS to the user\u2019s riding habits.\nVerge already equips the range-topping model with safety aids like traction control and ABS along with comfort features such as cruise control. The firm plans to periodically refine those systems and the Starmatter algorithms by distributing \u201cdeep core updates\u201d via over-the-air (OTA) technology.\nThe first Starmatter-equipped Ultras are slated to start shipping in Q4 2024 and Verge \u201cupgraded\u201d all existing reservation holders to the tech-laden trim. Fortunately, the TS Ultra\u2019s price tag remains $44,900 in the United States. Verge isn\u2019t the only electric mobility brand extolling the benefits of artificial intelligence, though.\nHorwin Senmenti series\nNot to be outdone, the Horwin Senmenti 0's spec sheet also skews toward the sensational. From its 659 foot-pounds of torque and 99 horsepower to its 125-mph top speed, the model\u2019s claimed capabilities appear excessive for an urban electric scooter. DC fast charging supposedly recharges (0-80%) its 16.9 kWh battery in 30 minutes and Horwin lists a 186-mile range.\nSimilar to Verge\u2019s TS Ultra, the Senmenti 0 relies on front- and rear-facing millimeter-wave radar, dual front cameras, and a four-camera \u201csurround-view system.\u201d The captured data and footage feed the model\u2019s AI-powered Advanced Riding Assistance System (ARAS), which identifies risk factors and includes traffic sign recognition and lane detection features, Horwin says.\nThe firm also maintains that ARAS \u201ccollects data to understand the rider, preventing accidents and enhancing rider protection and confidence.\u201d That information isn\u2019t restrained to the owner\u2019s individual scooter, either. The Senmenti 0\u2019s vehicle-to-vehicle networking technology also connects to nearby Horwin models, enabling voice communication and information exchange between multiple units.\nWhile local data sharing poses its own concerns, information sent back to the manufacturer may cause more unease among U.S. customers. Recently, the Chinese company established its U.S. arm, Horwin America, in California. Only Senmenti pre-orders and deliveries will determine whether Horwin\u2019s stateside presence eases those potential data security concerns.\nInitial Senmenti 0 shipments are scheduled to begin in November and customers can secure a reservation by placing a $100 deposit. To stoke interest in the $16,800 electric scooter, Horwin offers three years of free charging and free lifetime OTA updates to the first 500 pre-order customers.\nArtificial intelligence stands to impact nearly every part of our lives, including motorcycling. If Verge and Horwin\u2019s CES presentation suggested anything, it\u2019s that the AI-aided future is closer than many of us anticipated. Now, Verge and Horwin must back up their claims by bringing the TS Ultra and Senmenti 0 to the U.S. market by late 2024. After all, AI-powered systems can\u2019t improve the safety of a bike that you can\u2019t ride.\n877-792-9455\nTell us what you love or what we need to fix."

Learn more\nVerge Rolls Out 2024 Smart Motorcycle With Onboard Camera & Radar Systems\nBy: Tim Huber Published: Jan 16, 2024\nBy: Tim Huber Published: Jan 16, 2024\nFirst breaking cover in 2018 as the RMK E2 before later being rebranded to its current name, the Verge TS Ultra is the epitome of an envelop-pushing motorcycle design, combining a sleek naked bike platform with an advanced EV powertrain, and a hubless rear wheel. Despite the already cutting-edge nature of its TS Ultra, Verge has now revealed that it has returned to the drawing board in order to deliver an even more state-of-the-art electric two-wheeler that now benefits from the addition of a multi-camera and radar system.\nJust like previous versions of the TS Ultra, the new, smarter version features a 150kW (201hp) motor that sends 885ft-lbs of torque to the bike\u2019s hubless rear wheel, enabling the thing to do 0-60mph in just 2.5 seconds. The bike\u2019s electric motor draws from a potent battery pack that affords a 233-mile range and has the ability to revive a complete recharge in as little as 25 minutes. Exceptional cornering and stopping abilities are also made possible through the addition of best-in-class suspension and braking hardware \u2014 courtesy of Ohlins and Brembo, respectively. Other highlights that come standard include heated grips, cruise control, and a locking onboard storage compartment with an integrated charging port.\nWhat really makes the bike special \u2014 and what separates it from prior versions of the TS Ultra \u2014 is its new bevy of onboard tech. The new model build\u2019s on the Starmatter software and intelligence platform that Verge first debuted late last year. On top of automatic over-the-air updates, advanced sensor technology, and moto-specifric artificial intelligence, this cutting-edge system now Laos benefits from a Human-Machine-Interface. It doesn\u2019t end there, as the bike has also been bestowed with half-a-dozen onboard cameras, plus front and rear-facing radar units, blindspot assistance, extended spatial awareness, and a bevy of hazard warnings. Also new for 2024 is the TS Ultra\u2019s new tank-mounted display unit. Best of all, customers that have ordered previous iterations of the bike will automatically receive the newly-announced smart features.\nStarting at $44,900, the Verge TS Ultra Smart Motorcycle can be configured on the company\u2019s site and is available for order now, with deliveries scheduled to begin in Q4 of 2024.\nFrom Our Partners\nRelwen\u2019s Quilted Tanker Jacket Is the Ultimate Wintertime Coat for Layering\nPresented by Huckberry\nNike\u2019s Zoom Vomero 5 Is One of the Most Complex Running Shoes Around\nPresented by Nike\nThe Best USA-Made Everyday Carry Essentials [VIDEO]\nPresented by Gerber\nMore Motorcycles\nYamaha Packed an Entire Studio into the SEQTRAK Music Station\nBy Cameron Cardwell\nThe Kith x Bose Ultra Open Earbuds Mark Bose\u2019s First Fashion Partnership\nBy Cameron Cardwell\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Smartphone Series Ushers in Galaxy AI\nBy Cameron Cardwell\nThe Hydrogen-Powered Sirius Jet Offers the Best Aspects of Planes & Helicopters\nBy Tim Huber\nMyArcade\u2019s Atari Gamestation Portable Squeezes 3 Classic Controllers into One Handheld\nBy Cameron Cardwell\nSony\u2019s XR Headset Will Target Creators Instead of Gamers\nBy Ethan Brehm\nIndependently published in Los Angeles, CA\n\u00a92024 HICONSUMPTION LLC.
