        "raw_content": "CR-Scan 01 3D scanner becomes better value as 3DMakerpro launches biggest-ever sale\nHigh-precision 3D scanner manufacturer 3DMakerpro has launched its largest-ever sale, bringing huge discounts to the cost of its proprietary CR-Scan 01.\nDesigned to pair consumer-level user-friendliness with industrial-grade accuracy, the CR-Scan 01 is said to be capable of capturing objects 1.5 times larger than its competitors without sacrificing precision. With the discounted sale price of $375, CR-Scan 01 is considered the most cost-effective large-format 3D scanner on market, including the upcoming Revopoint RANGE.\n3DMakerpro\u2019s 3D scanning expertise\nEstablished as an overseas brand of Shenzhen Jimuyida Technology Co., Ltd in 2015, 3DMakerpro specializes in the development of professional-grade but cost-effective 3D scanners. To date, the company has spent more than $30 million dollars on R&D, and its team of 100 research personnel continues to work on new scanning innovations.\nIn-house, this team has already developed software algorithms that accelerate scanning aspects such as multi-spectral projection, visual tracking, no-marking registration, and automatic model processing. This crew has also developed a fully automatic optical calibration system, with a monthly capacity of over 10,000 units, as part of an R&D drive that has yielded over 60 patented technologies.\nIn practice, the firm\u2019s development exploits have been borne out, not just in the launch of the CR-Scan 01, but its Magic Swift Plus and Whale 3D scanners. Built to address applications where compactness, portability, or extreme precision are highly sought after, each is now shipped in Europe, the US, and other regions around the world.\nIntroducing the CR-Scan 01\nThose already familiar with the 3D scanning space may have seen the CR-Scan 01 being promoted as a Creality product in the past, but the device was actually developed alongside 3DMakerpro. In fact, the companies have become close partners, with 3DMakerpro taking up responsibilities around the device\u2019s development, production, and marketing.\nWhen it comes to the design of the CR-Scan 01 itself, it has been built from the ground up to address the consumer-level market. For instance, the device features automatic matching, so users can simply start scanning without having to calibrate and mark individual objects. The CR-Scan 01 can also be used in either handheld or turntable mode in a way that allows users to flex their approach where needed.\nOn the performance front, 3DMakerpro\u2019s device is capable of scanning medium-to-large objects including body parts, while capturing details down to a size of just 0.1mm. With the system\u2019s reliance on NIR near-safety light scanning technology also making it eye-safe, the firm says it\u2019s ideal for those professionals in the animation, VR, or AR industries, seeking to model objects, animals, robots, or humans.\nTo help those less familiar with 3D scanning, 3DMakerpro also ships the CR-Scan 01 with JMStudio, a software that gives the device a streamlined, easy-to-operate UI. Given that JMStudio is compatible with three standard output formats \u2013 STL, OBJ, and PLY, as well as platforms like Geomagic, MeshLab, and Autodesk CAD, it should be a cinch to set up.\nCR-Scan 01 vs the RANGE, which is best?\nSo, those are (broadly) the key selling points of the CR-Scan 01, but how does it stack up against the Revopoint RANGE? At time of writing, many of the latter\u2019s specifications haven\u2019t been made public, but based on what we do know, the CR-Scan 01 appears able to hold its own. In terms of precision, the two units can both capture details just 0.1 mm in size, though the RANGE\u2019s resolution isn\u2019t yet known.\nThe same can be said for optics and scale-of-operation, with both featuring full-color RGB cameras and large-format scanning capabilities, but their ranges vary slightly. With the CR-Scan 01, users can work at a single capture range of 378 x 536 mm, marginally less than with the RANGE, but it can do so with greater flexibility over working distance, at anywhere between 400mm and 900 mm.\nAs such, while the Revopoint is something of an unknown quantity, with its frame rate, resolution, and even its light source still a mystery, the CR-Scan 01 has been launched, tried, and tested. That said, 3DMakerpro also predicts that its device will be the same price, so to make sure it stays ahead of the competition, it has reduced the CR-Scan 01 from $450 to $375 from February 1, 2023.\nProspective customers can visit 3DMakerpro official store or contact 3DMakerpro here for more information or visit their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.\nTo stay up to date with the latest 3D printing news, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the 3D Printing Industry newsletter or follow us on Twitter or liking our page on Facebook.\nWhile you\u2019re here, why not subscribe to our Youtube channel? featuring discussion, debriefs, video shorts and webinar replays.\nAre you looking for a job in the additive manufacturing industry?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nArtec Sues Creality For Allegedly Copying 3D Scanner Software, Wants Kickstarter to Withhold Funds From Campaign\nThe scanning application comes with the CR-Scan Lizard which was recently on Kickstarter.\nArtec Europe, makers of precision 3D scanners, is claiming Creality 3D Technology copied code from Artec Studio to make its own CR Studio 3D scanning software. It requested a temporary restraining order to prevent Kickstarter from distributing funds pledged to Creality for the CR -can Lizard. Artec is seeking a jury trial against the popular 3D printer maker for alleged patent and copyright infringement.\nCreality did not respond to our request for comment but has reassured backers that it will honor their Kickstarter pledges. One backer in St. Louis received a message from Creality saying:\n\"Dear backers,\nWe have received your messages, and we are dealing with it now. Please give us some time, and rest assured that we will definitely send the product to you. Any questions please contact scanner@creality.com.\nCreality team\u201d\nA little more than $4 million US dollars was raised by 9,472 backers interested in Creality\u2019s new 3D scanner. According to court documents, Artec feared that once the backer\u2019s money is transferred to China, it would be \u201cvirtually impossible for Artec to recover any portion of these funds.\u201d\nKickstarter\u2019s lawyers have stated the company is a neutral party to the copyright dispute and, according to its terms of service, is obligated to transfer funds within 14 days of the conclusion of a successful campaign. However, the Kickstarter page for the CR-Scan Lizard has been replaced by a message about the intellectual property dispute.\nCreality is best known as the manufacturer of affordable 3D printers, such as the popular Ender 3 Pro and Ender 2 Pro, which are among the best 3D printers overall. It partnered with Shenzhen Jimuyida Technology, a 3D digital application provider, to develop its new scanner.\nArtec is known for the Artec Leo, a professional wireless 3D scanner priced at $29,800.\nThe copyright dispute revolves around the software behind the CR-Scan Lizard and the CR Scan 01. Tom\u2019s Hardware was given the opportunity to independently review a prototype CR-Scan Lizard. We found the beta software to be somewhat lacking and in need of improvement, but we liked the hardware.\nIn its filing, Artec claims several former employees went to work for Jimuyida and brought with them improper copies of Artec\u2019s code. Litigation over this intellectual property rewarded Artec exclusive rights to software it had developed.\nCreality\u2019s lawyer asserts that Jimuyida independently developed the code without the work of former Artec employees.\nKickstarter is an American company headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. Creality is based in Shenzhen, China. Artec headquarters are in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg with offices in both Santa Clara, California and Shanghai, China.

In the midst of the revolution, new trends such as digital inspection and traceability are emerging in numerous manufacturing sectors including automotive aerospace. With 3D scanning which guarantees precision, it will eliminate pain points in manufacturing industries such as low accuracy, low detection efficiency and operational difficulty. These tasks which require complex measurements would be greatly simplified, hence significantly reducing costs associated with product development and production. Compare to 3D printing, China\u2019s 3D scanning industry is tepid. JD Scan (\u7cbe\u8fea\u79d1\u6280), which develops 3D optical measurement equipment, is among the well trusted domestic players. Globally, Hexagon, Trimble Navigation and Faro Technology are among the 3D scanner market leaders, capturing a total of 37.3%. 3D digital technology industry in China is still at its infancy stage. China\u2019s digital market in 2017 reached CNY 3.4 billion and is expected to double its size to CNY 6.3 billion by 2023, with a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 10.8%.

Ltd., selling software that seems quite similar to Artec 3D\u2019s software, and Creality licensing that software for use with their new 3D scanner. While it appears that Shenzhen Jimuyida Technology Co. Ltd. is the root of the issue, Kickstarter and Creality were drawn into the legal action and it\u2019s possible they may both have been unaware of the status of this software.\nRegardless, Kickstarter immediately suspended the campaign while things were being sorted out. At the time of the suspension, something close to US$4M was raised from backers wishing to use the 3D scanner, representing almost 10,000 units.\nWhile the lawsuit is still underway, it appears that one part of the action is resolved: according to a document from Kickstarter\u2019s legal team, the backers will be refunded their money.\nThe document said:\n\u201cLast week, Creality asked Kickstarter to simply refund to its campaign backers all money raised from the CR-Scan Lizard campaign. Given that the Court has not ordered Kickstarter to retain the campaign funds, Kickstarter has agreed to begin issuing refunds to all campaign backers at the beginning of next week. Since issuing these refunds will essentially return the parties to the state of affairs that existed prior to the commencement of Creality\u2019s Kickstarter campaign, Kickstarter believes that its decision moots the pending request for injunctive relief, as well as Artec\u2019s pending claim for liability against Kickstarter.\u201d\nThat\u2019s excellent news for those contributors that might have otherwise lost their money. A message from Creality to backers suggested the refund processs should take a week or so to complete.\nI believe this is not the end of the lawsuit, as Artec 3D had demands beyond ceasing distribution and stopping Kickstarter payments to Creality, which included damages determined by jury. It\u2019s not clear in what state that part of the ligation sits today, but we may hear more in the future.\nYou might be wondering why a European company would file a complaint against a Chinese company in a US court. That\u2019s because Artec 3D had evidence that US citizens backed the project, and with Kickstarter being a US company, they felt they had jurisdiction to file the case.\nThe implication of this lawsuit is that we might never again see a major Asian company use Kickstarter as a launch platform for new products, simply to avoid situations like this.\n[UPDATE] Backers now report today they\u2019ve received information from Creality offering to ship the 3D scanner if the funds from the refund are applied to a \u201cpledgebox\u201d. In other words, they are selling the 3D scanner through a platform other than Kickstarter in much the same way. The note from Creality said:\n\u201cWhat you need to do is pay the same amount as before through PledgeBox now. The taxes are not included on the price.\nLizard is forced to choose a hard road from the day it was born, but we still try our best to bring it to you. We\u2019re sure you\u2019ll like it.
