  "Question": "Aeva CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "Aeva\n\nProduct: Aeva Atlas 4D LiDAR Sensor\n\n- Aeva Atlas is the first automotive-grade 4D LiDAR sensor designed for mass production automotive applications, aimed at enhancing advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving at highway speeds.\n- Powered by Aeva's custom silicon technology, including the Aeva CoreVision next-gen Lidar-on-Chip module and Aeva X1 System-on-Chip processor, the sensor is over 70% smaller and consumes four times less power than the previous generation, enabling seamless integrations in-cabin, behind the windshield, on the vehicle's roofline, or in the grille.\n- The sensor utilizes Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) 4D LiDAR technology, providing a 25% greater detection range for low-reflectivity targets and a maximum detection range of up to 500 meters, while being immune to interference from direct sunlight, signals from other LiDAR sensors, and retroreflective objects.\n- Aeva's perception software harnesses advanced machine learning-based classification, detection, and tracking algorithms, utilizing the additional dimension of velocity data for more intelligent and safe decision-making by autonomous devices.\n- Aeva plans to release Atlas for production consumer and commercial vehicles starting in 2025, with samples available to select automotive OEMs and mobility customers earlier."
