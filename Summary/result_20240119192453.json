  "Question": "Stellantis CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "Stellantis\n\nProduct: Virtual Cockpit Platform\n\n- Stellantis, in collaboration with AWS and BlackBerry QNX, has developed a virtual cockpit platform as part of its virtual engineering workbench (VEW).\n- The platform enables the delivery of infotainment tech to customers 100 times faster than previous processes.\n- It can create realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, without needing to change the main software that runs them.\n- The platform uses the QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which is available via AWS Marketplace in the QNX Accelerate portfolio of cloud-based tools.\n- Stellantis can include a virtual cockpit high-performance computing (HPC) simulation into a cloud environment, offering little to no difference between running QNX Hypervisor-based systems in the cloud versus on real hardware.\n- The real-time feedback allows Stellantis to solicit valuable feedback from its customer and developer base to build future infotainment features and applications."
