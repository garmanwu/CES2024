  "Question": "xMEMS Labs, Inc. CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "xMEMS Labs, Inc.\n\nProduct: Cypress MEMS Speaker\n\n- The Cypress MEMS speaker achieves 40X louder bass response and is designed to replace traditional coil-and-magnet speakers in active noise canceling (ANC) earbuds.\n- It utilizes ultrasonic amplitude modulation transduction principle to turn ultrasonic air pulses into rich, detailed, bass-heavy, high-fidelity sound.\n- Features a modulator to generate an amplitude-modulated ultrasonic wave and a demodulator to synchronously demodulate the ultrasonic wave, transferring the acoustic energy down to the baseband, producing the intended audible sound.\n- It is 6.3 x 6.5 x 1.65mm in size, providing stronger, deeper bass with sound pressure levels (SPL) greater than 140dB as low as 20Hz.\n- Offers faster electrical-to-acoustic conversion contributing to wider ANC bandwidth and reduced DSP filter complexity for shorter DSP latency, rounding errors, and power consumption when processing ANC.\n- Full-function Cypress prototype silicon is sampling to select early customers, with production-candidate samples and mass production planned for late-2024."
