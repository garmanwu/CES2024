  "Question": "PhysioFlow/Manatec Biomedical CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "PhysioFlow/Manatec Biomedical\n\nPhysioFlow CES 2024\n\n- Latest Advances in Cardiac Output Monitoring from High-Definition Impedance Cardiography\n- Provides key measures of central systolic and diastolic and peripheral vascular function\n- Monitors heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, stroke volume index, cardiac index, ventricular ejection time, contractility index, ejection fraction, left cardiac work index, end diastolic volume, early diastolic filling ratio, systemic vascular resistance, and systemic vascular resistance index continuously\n- Intrarater reliability and agreement assessed during rest, submaximal exercise, and high-intensity interval exercise\n- Heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, left cardiac work index, and end diastolic volume demonstrated a good level of reliability across activity types and intensities\n- Other variables measured by this device appear less reliable"
