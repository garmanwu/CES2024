  "Question": "WePower Technologies CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "WePower Technologies\n\nEnergy Harvesting Generators at CES 2024\n\n- Debuting three production-ready energy harvesting generator (EHG) prototypes: G100 push-button switch EHG, G150 vibration-activated EHG, and G200 EHG in an industrial limit switch, supported by Silicon Labs\n- Enhanced production-ready version of G200 EHG within a wireless, batteryless water sensor\n- G100 push-button switch captures kinetic energy at a rate of more than 30 times that of the competition, enabling a transmission output exceeding 8dBm\n- G150 vibration-activated EHG continuously draws power from vibrations and communicates the vibrationsâ€™ magnitudes\n- G200 EHG powers secure wireless transmissions across a diverse range of chips, with substantially higher power output compared to current market offerings\n- Wireless, batteryless Gemns EHGs harvest energy from motion for small-scale data transmission devices\n- Critical for the growth of the IoT, especially in the US where consumers throw away more than three billion batteries a year"
