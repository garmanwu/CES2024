  "Question": "Google Privacy Sandbox CES 2024 product highlight and specification",
  "Summary": "Google\n\nProduct: Privacy Sandbox\n\n- The Privacy Sandbox is an initiative by Google to develop new privacy-preserving technologies as an alternative to third-party cookies, aiming to improve user privacy while supporting key marketing use cases for online businesses.\n- The Privacy Sandbox APIs, including the Topics API, will enable interest-based advertising in a more private way by allowing a user's browser to determine and share a handful of topics representing their top interests for the previous week based on their browsing activity.\n- The Topics API ensures privacy by avoiding sensitive categories, selecting topics locally on users' devices, and providing user controls to view, remove, or opt out of the Privacy Sandbox APIs entirely.\n- Google plans to expand the testing of Privacy Sandbox APIs and aims to begin phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in the second half of 2024, offering a more private, targeted advertising experience while rendering third-party cookies obsolete."
